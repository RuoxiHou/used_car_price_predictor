"If you go this route, find the most recent model year within your budget and opt for the V-8.  The V-8 has more room in the engine bay than the W-12 (looking at you coil packs).  Most things can be worked on but there will be things where it will need to go to a shop (especially if you don’t have a lift available to you).  Not certain if still the case but on older Continental GT’s, the front quarter panels have to be removed to replace the headlight bulbs if they go out.  Most bugaboos will be in the electronics than the engine/drivetrain which are fairly robust.",Bentley

"Honestly there is nothing on these cars that make them more unreliable than any other European luxury car of the time. The Bosch K-jet System probably causes the most headaches, but tons of other vehicles used the same system.",Bentley

"Unfortunately the vast majority have turned into unloved pigs with just short drives and no maintenance in the last few years. IF WELL serviced and loved and driven a lot, they are good cars.

Bond style pop up machine guns on the bonnet would be good,Bentley
"My dream is to go on a road trip, socal to east coast with one of these 😀",Bentley
"To be fair the main reason shops price it out that way is because it's a spiderweb of individual lines and fittings, so chasing down the singular problem line is time consuming. Then its the matter of getting to that line to replace it, some are easy and others not at all. Lastly, if you are replacing one line that was dry rotted/cracked from age, there are likely several others not far behind it and so fragile they could be damaged during the repair. Shops and dealers are very much on the side of ""all or nothing"" because its very easily a job that could have to be redone if only done piece meal.

And thats dope your guy was able to do that! If he is able to get back in there and add som heat insulation or heat tape that will help the repair go the distance for sure!",Bentley
"It’s not a percentage on the price of the vehicle. It’s percentage of gross profit, somewhere between 20-30%",Bentley

"Personally I think it was every British car manufacturer from the 70s up to the early 2000s. Lotus, MG, Aston Martin and Jaguar, all cut corners in one way or another and gave the brand a bad name.",Bentley
"So, then you should be pissed off at the state (read: government) that extorts you (taxation).  You’re playing into the system’s hands: when getting upset with the guy who finds a way to be violated a little less, than being exceptionally pissed with the state that extorts us all.",Bentley

Not true at all. The address you use for insurance is where the cars are located. This can be completely different than registration. I’ve got a windshield claim being paid out today on an Amg with no objection from insurance co and mine are like this,Bentley
Nope,Bentley

"So status symbol in so many words.  I think owning an older one will be a nightmare and youd be up to 10,000 in maintenance costs in a few years. What happens to an a part breaks and it cost $6,500? That would suck",Bentley
"Yes, I hope to not be in the shop often, that would be terrible. Sadly the v8 continentals came out 2012+ they are slightly out of my price range, but if it saves on repairs it may be something to consider. Thank You.",Bentley
I’m sure this won’t be a popular opinion but imo it’s the lack of onboard computer diagnostics people really take that obd port and it’s many features for granted. These old girls can be very very difficult to diagnose they have a lot of complicated systems and a lack of feedback loops to ensure they are operating properly. Couple that with comically awful British electronics and wiring diagrams that are incorrect and you have a car that is not only unreliable but now is incredibly difficult to fix compounding the unreliability problem,Bentley
To add to this it’s a Mulsanne Speed. 2014-2015,Bentley

Overhyped BMW with flashy status and badging . . .,Bentley
"It’s because the Mulsanne was totally designed by Bentley with little to no VW parts. And probably it was meant to be the final model of all the Rolls-Royce/Bentley saloons produced during the Vickers ownership era. Hence why the interior looks very similar to how it is in models like Brooklands, Azure, Continental R, Turbo R, etc.",Bentley
That Tahoe stands out. My Santa Fe not so much.,Bentley

"I saw a dude in a brand new Ferrari (not sure the model) scrape the entire lower part of his car along a tall curb while he was pulling in to a bar in Newport Beach, CA.   He got out, took a look at the scrape that went from front to rear wheel on the passenger side also scraping both rims on that side.   He absolutely flipped the fuck out and left very quickly.   complete douche - I had to laugh.

That fact is, though, people who can afford these cars can usually afford repairing them too and don't normally care about damage like this.   To them, it's just a car.",Bentley

"Fair price imo. Nothing special. Early GTs are know to have issues that are expensive to make right and hurt values. 

This particular car is a very basic spec as well imo (no Mulliner, Speed pack, etc….). Why does it have aftermarket wheels?

Buhahahaha.  But that turn looks brutal,Bentley
"Yep, 1.15 trillion dollars worth of chassis right there…",Bentley
"Use 95 (98RON) as I’m guessing you’re in Europe. If you’re driving a Bentley $50 a fill up shouldn’t change a lot.

Using a lower octane makes the engine work harder, hurts your mileage, and long term can hurt your vehicle. This is the same across all luxury vehicles, they’re high compression engines so they need higher octane to run efficiently.",Bentley

"After thinking, https://truetune.info/. These peeps took my hp from 560 to 680 for £400. Well worth it :-) 0-60 is 3.5 zoom zoom. Maybe after your arnage it is fixed free of charge, you can up its horses, and the system allows you to set to factory before a service and back to faster after the service.",Bentley

"Recommend going with a 2012. A bit pricier but still gives you the updated look, better infotainment and similar maintenance cost. In theory should last longer since the repairs if done routinely should drive a little better. Otherwise. The 1st generation tends to have a lot of electrical problems due to age",Bentley
Sedan all day everyday💪,Bentley
My 5 year old fits perfectly fine and loves the GT,Bentley
"Tire wheel coverage as noted - Extended warranty through Bentley.

Going over  bump and destroying a wheel is a fast was to lose 5k.

Make sure all windows function normally during top open and close scenarios. Most common issue I’ve seen on them are faults relating to these. Get maintenance records in detail and ensure the top has not been replaced, if it has make sure frame was as well and everything functions. 

Top replacements on these are $60,000 at dealer.

Get measurements for all wear and tear items (brakes and tires) to use that to negotiate if needed.

All that, ensure maintenance was done, and enjoy! One of the best coupes ever made, if not the best. Engines are rock solid.

"Yeah you’re correct. Big, luxury saloons have died a death really, people want to be driven around in big luxurious SUVs instead these days. The Flying Spur is a big saloon you drive yourself, not one you’re driven in. Different types of vehicle (not to mention the Spur and the Mulsanne overlapped in production dates).

Has the car also had its plastic cooling hoses replaced because that engine out work along with the other sensors and wear items accessible should also be budgeted at $8k-10k,Bentley
The idea of spending thousands on correction and paint protection after purchasing car of this caliber would not sit well with me regardless of having the means,Bentley

"Why because British engineering and manufacturing...they spent 90% of the time on strike and the other 10% they spent drunk on the job complaining £8/hr [roughly £25/hr today] isn't enough to live on while also complaining about a 8 hour work day and no mandatory PTO...

"That sounds like a plan. We had 3 dogs w us, so the hotel breaks were as much for them as us. Lol This east route was by far the preferred way to go. We'd gone the other way many times and encountered traffic, snow, rain etc. This other way, once you get over Snoqualmie pass, is by far easier, much less traffic and overall a much more pleasant drive. SQ pass should be clear and dry this time of year but obvi check first. We literally missed 2 feet of snow that fell 3 days after we crossed. Enjoy your trip.",Bentley

These luxury car subs are wild. GenZ and your first car and your asking if you can make it 6 months without needing a repair?  Let’s take a step back and call your insurance agent first to see what that’s going to look like. Then call your accountant and have him run the numbers for you.,Bentley
"My guess is that someone bought it cheap because they lose their value so quickly, then something broke that was way too expensive for the person's budget.",Bentley
"Probably because having the interior (especially the driver and front passenger space) all covered up in wood and leather would be a lot more expensive, and this is what the Mulsanne was all about (like the Brooklands, Azure, Arnage, etc.). Not to mention how many days, not to say weeks, it would take to be built, that also wouldn’t help (especially if you need to pay your employees to hand-build your cars). Here’s why newer models have more plastic in the interior, including the Flying Spur.

Then combine the already expensive production costs of the Mulsanne with the pandemic that happened in 2020, that caused shortages of semiconductors (a vital part of most if not all modern cars), which in their turn slowed down the production of a lot of cars. Also add the fact that they need to pay annual taxes, and their income dropped too much to keep up with taxation.

I think this is the reason why Bentley decided to stop making the Mulsanne for good.",Bentley

Had rear bumper off to fix a leak. Easy. To name just a few. Parts aren't that expensive if they are OEM. Example from autodoc, stick to Bosch. Dealers will cripple you with costs and my experience they aren't that knowledgeable, they are interested in fast turn around service. have service done at the dealer, otherwise all repairs, brakes, mech, electrical, get done via independent. Unless you are willing to try yourself.  Dealers and some independents said I needed to drop the engine to do camshaft sensors, which I didn't. Don't believe what they say. Do your research or mech repairs. Also use it as a second car, keep a run around for popping to shops.",Bentley

"Depends on the black and the config tho.

I got a black with the Mulliner spec and the chrome cross grille and self-leveling badged 22"" wheels; and it's very very very attention grabbing.

However, what I regret about the black is that it's near impossible to see the insane curves of the car (the haunches, for instance) in the black. You'd see these in the white, but the white looks a wee bit less premium on the FS (in my opinion).

"They're profitable *now*. They weren't in 2019 when VAG hierarchy made their threat. Hallmark had to lay off 25% of Crewe staff to do it. The alternative was that VAG were to going to lay off about 90% and move all production except special orders to Germany. That was the middle ground option with the worst case being selling off Bentley.

As for rip-off pricing, they're comparable to their competitors and offer a product none of them can even come close to in terms of interior design, material quality, and the combination of luxury and performance. (For this purpose I'm not considering Rolls Royce a competitor because of their pricing.) If you want to spend less money you'll be getting a compromised product in terms of customization options, materials, and the combination of power and comfort. It doesn't mean it won't be a nice car - low six figures still buys you a wonderful car while being half the price of any Bentley - but it will be obviously built to a price point once you start looking around.",Bentley

"Color or not, the main problem with Bentley coupes is that they are sized for oompah-loompahs.  There is _severely_ limited headroom.  If you're over about 5'9, you're not gonna be happy in this car.  🤣 Of course, a red Bentley coupe is probably a really serious attempt at compensating for Short Man's Disease in the first place.",Bentley

Yes the new Genesis are fantastic interiors. Kia and Hyundai have learned how to make affordable interiors feel and look upscale. I’m really impressed with their new rides.

"Oh boy, if you do buy one... BRAKE LINES. The whole brake system is ridiculous I've heard and I don't think any ""grit"" or percussive maintenance will make it work. You need an actual Bentley pro who can do them. I mean, you can, but apparently it's EXTREMELY overengineered.",Bentley

"I would not suggest getting this one in the picture. The lower front bumper is not correct for that vehicle which tells me it probably was in some sort of accident. The small Bentley logos on the headrest are also not factory, which tells me it’s been modified in probably more ways than just visual.  These wheels were not available on this exact car, so they are not original to the vehicle. I’m seeing lots of red flags for customized and not well taken care of vehicles.",Bentley

The Flying Spur is a great Flying Spur but it is no Mulsanne. The current Flying Spur has more plastic parts around the interior than the Mulsanne had. It doesn’t feel up to the exact same level in terms of old school craftsmanship like that of the Mulsanne. The Mulsanne was the last of its kind in my opinion.,Bentley

"Combination of all of those. Cars like Bentley, Rolls, and Maybach tend to be overbuilt. So they use more fasteners in places other manufacturers use clips for example. More work to disassemble. They also require special tooling. For example you need a special wrench to remove the front bumper on the Flying Spur in this subreddit. The tool used to cost north of 300.00. When the facelift versions came out, *a different tool* was required. That's more $$$ to invest. Then comes the cost of support. I pay 12k a year for access to their wiring diagrams, and repair information. In comparison, the yearly sub for BMW ISTA is $2500. 

You got to pay to play with these vehicles. That's why a lot of shops don't mess with them, out side of specialists.",Bentley

Don’t see how the tint would make the lights less functional but that’s just my opinion. Not gonna take away from the visibility that much at all. It’s just the tail lights and the side markers I’m wanting to tint/smoke. Definitely would never do that to those gorgeous headlights. Just see black everywhere on this car and then hit those big bright red tail lights and side markers. Just think appearance wise it will look so much better.,Bentley

Get mulliner spec, otherwise you'll wish you bought one later on. Check for the massage function on seats. Ciggy lighters there, tools in boot. No ingress of water in the bottom of the spare tyre area. Check the spoiler flap goes up and down, check steering lock fault that's quite common. Check sagging leather on the roof. Check seats and move back and forth. Check for dimples in seats where the seatbelt hits them.",Bentley

"I own this car. 2007. Here is what I posted to another user who was asking this same question. Pasting…

I have a 2007 GTC. I’ll give you my pros and cons. Pros:  The biggest pro is the way this car makes me feel every time I get into it. It’s the best “pro” a car can offer IMO. I absolutely love driving this car with the top down. I almost never put it up TBH.  It’s a really handsome ride and is definitely a head turner.  You will hear comments, get thumbs up, and occasionally have someone ask to take a picture with the car. The car is heavy and it feels heavy, which I like. It’s a nice smooth ride.  Love the sound system. Beautiful wood grain and leather interior which I still admire. The engine is powerful and the car is surprisingly fast, especially at speed (I’ll list the engine lag from 0 in the cons).  I love the auto close doors.  Don’t need to slam the doors in a Bentley.  The car pulls it shut for you. Great feature. Awesome seats. They’re practically a work of art. Beautiful leather and very adjustable. Great seats. I’ve had this 2007 for a long time and I still get a kick seeing the car in the garage.  It’s just pretty.  In total I really enjoy the driving experience. Very different than driving my other cars.  Satisfying.

Cons:  Yes repairs are expensive. I haven’t had to repair anything major yet but almost anything costs a lot.  Most recent, four new tires were $2500. But tires for any car in this class will cost a lot.  I’ll have brakes next and that will cost…a lot. Find an independent exotic car repair shop instead of the dealer. I called three, asked them to propose an annual maintenance plan, and picked the one I liked the best.

The car is powerful, but there is an brief annoying lag from standstill.  It is brief, but it still makes me wish it clutched slightly quicker.  But hey, it’s a Bentley not a Ferrari.

The batteries are a problem. You will have dead batteries if you aren’t careful.  The batteries are accessed in the trunk, so I bought the required battery tender, hooked it up, and secured it neatly inside the trunk. Then I hang the plug tail out the back so I don’t have to open the trunk every time to plug it in.  Every time I come home, I plug the extension in and voila…no more battery discharge issues. Is that ridiculous?  Yes. But owning cars in this class is ridiculous to begin with so this is what we do.

Interior controls are tedious. No bluetooth connectivity, so you’re listening to the CD changer or the radio.  You’re answering your phone on your Bluetooth earpiece instead of through the car. No usable navigation on the 2007 so It’s google maps on your phone instead. No built in usb ports. I plug a USB adapter into the center port so I can charge my phone. Works fine.  The interior controls are old and clunky.  Very outdated by 2023 standards.  Multiple button pushes to access climate control, for example. Then you have to select the audio function separately to make changes to that.  Then back again. It’s just old tech. The climate control itself is fine.  It’s just all the manual button pushes that’s a hassle.  Do I feel silly complaining that I have too many buttons to push in my Bentley?  Yes.  But you asked.  And I can’t get my garage doors to sync with the car, so I clip the garage opener onto the visor.   Eh. Fine. Oh also, No backup camera in the 2007.  That’s the thing that is most irritating. It’s sure not life changing, but I wish it had a backup camera.  C’est la vie.

Overall, I adore this vehicle. As old as it is, I still love driving this car every single time.",Bentley

"Does the warranty cover the head? I remember buying a car with a silver warranty and it didn't cover some turbo hoses. Very much sounds like a head gasket, is there oil dripping from the bottom of the car? If coolant and other bits mixed up there maybe other knackered bits, maybe coolant/water pump, new sparks, to say the least, maybe rads need draining. I once had a mini that needed a new head gasket and needed slight head skim too as it made a small warp mess. I wouldnt expect them to drop the engine unless it's very confined in there, but 5 days to drop and put back plus day to fix the gasket unless there is warp. Couple of weeks tops. Subject to their schedules and parts.

Thankfully you had warranty otherwise very pricey repair",Bentley

"Many parts are actually of higher quality than a normal car. Lets not forget that a much larger part of Rolls Royces and Bentley's of that age are still driving than Toyota's or Chevy's. It's just that when a 1980's Chevy truck needs a 3.000 dollar repair, it's a total loss.

However, luxury cars usually exist of much more components than normal cars. The more stuff there is on the car, the more stuff can break. This is especially true with more modern luxury cars that have a lot of expensive but fragile electronics on board.

Also, weight matters. Higher weight means more wear and tear on weight bearing components. They will either wear down faster or are of higher quality and therefore more expensive to replace.",Bentley

Bingo.,Bentley
The Mulsanne has a much nicer interior than the flying spur.  For example the Mulsanne and the Arnage before it have solid wood backing that the decorative veneer is on.  All current Bentleys have the veneer on a laminate of aluminum backing plate.   The Mulsanne is just a level above the other products.  Same as the phantom to the ghost.,Bentley

"The Mulsanne stands out in design even more than the Arnage because the latter was made as “side-model” of the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph dating back to the Rolls-Royce/Bentley merger days, while the Mulsanne has been entirely designed by Bentley, after 80 years since the 8 Litre. Also, unlike the Continental and Flying Spur, it retained the original components before VW takeover, including the 6.75 litre V8. Maybe the only thing which wasn’t from Bentley is the ZF 8-speed gearbox, but these are details.",Bentley

I’m not sure why anyone would see a Flying Spur, Bentayga, etc etc as a weekend car, they’re designed to be big, luxurious, fast cars you can actually use.  
  
I do agree with you on the W12, and the proper Bentley feel. I absolutely love my Bentayga, but it is - if I’m being completely honest with myself - an SQ7 on steroids, wearing a ballroom dress. My Arnage is a “proper” Bentley.",Bentley

"At that age and mileage, I'm going to guess the vehicle was a business lease, and the owner didn't give a crock, because the vehicle was likely paying for itself. Or rather, whatever stream of income they garnered was paying for the vehicle. 

Hence, the owner said 🖕🏽and put miles on it and paid the penalty. So long as it has a service history you can verify, go for it. 

Outside of that, the real concerns you should have at the moment (depending on market) is the cost of fuel and insurance. These things don't believe in environmentalism I can tell you that, 😂 and at least here in my area, insurance has become criminal. Just food for thought.",Bentley

"Prices for the W12 skyrocketing isn't likely. Assuming you're talking about the 3rd gen, the Continental/Flying Spur in general should have better residuals than the famously depreciative Phaeton platform cars as they're more desirable but they will (and do) still lose a lot of value, regardless of powertrain. The L series V8, arguably an even more prestigious engine, was also discontinued a few years ago and yet Mulsannes still depreciate quite significantly.

Curious how you'd be able to afford to keep the car though if you'd need to save for a fractionally more expensive engine option (which it should be noted can't be ordered from new anymore anyway- sales ceased in December)",Bentley

They get the knowledge, experience, and tooling, spin off a BMW variant, and then dump off the brand. That's exactly what they did.

"Yes the W8 was first introduced in the second gen Continental. Then made its way over to the Flying Spur. The first generation W12 used in the Bentleys was the same block as the W12 used on Phaeton and Touareg. The differences are NA vs TT, and of course the upgrades to accommodate force induction. Still, there are many parts that are interchangeable, but a direct swap it is not for obvious reasons. You can modify a W12 NA block to work in a Bentley, but the internals are unique to Bentley, Spyker, and Bugatti. With Bugatti adding 4 more cylinders.",Bentley

Wheel bearings, headliner, steering column motor, 02 sensors, transmission services, front bumper was very brittle due to age and would crack due to it.

Why ? BECAUSE THE PARTS ARE EXPENSIVE AS FUCK 😂 
I LITERALLY Have seen atleast 9 Bentleys get abandon at body shops because they didn’t know how expensive it’d be to fix the car and the body shop puts a Lien on it and keeps it. 
It’s always the same story too, someone bought a cheap $25-40k Bentley that’s supposed to be $150-200K brand new , and of course it’s not under warranty and the person didn’t realize how expensive it’d be to fix it when issues arise , and they always always Arise !!!!! 
If you can’t spend an extra $10-15K to upgrade and get a more durable , modern, comfortable version / year 
Then you won’t be able to afford $800-1,500 headlights , thousands for tires 🛞, and any engine work will be thousands as well.

"I have a 2014 Flying Spur and so far I’ve put 70k miles on it and it’s been a champ. Other than brakes and oil changes I needed to change the suspension (it’s a heavy car) and the batteries once. It’s literally my daily driver including in the Chicago winters and I’ve loved it. I wouldn’t recommend the first gen, one of my friends has one and it’s been terrible to him",Bentley

"I have cars ranging from 2023 to 1970. I wasn't alive then, but there were no backup cameras in 1970...not knowing how to reverse or parallel park without a cam isn't always an option. I also want an 85-87 Grand National, and that aint got a camera either. But go off. 😂",Bentley

"If sports car fun handling is what you are looking for, this wont give you what you want, and it being a convertible is even worse since it adds weight.

"I’m a GM in south Florida at a big wholesale dealer I sell these bentley and I have the buyer come back to sell it back after a month, trust me if you are looking for something sporty, I would just rethink about a 07 Bentley. At the end of the day if you have f you money then by all means go ahead and buy it, but this car will eat up your wallets real fast. In my experience it’s can be a gamble at that age for a Bentley anything can go wrong, I’ll suggest you look into something that sporty but something you don’t want to have in the shop pretty often n eating up your money it’s ruins the fun of owning the car.",Bentley

I was a rolls Royce mechanic ( technician ) for the dealership for many years. They leak engine oil from the factory brand new under warranty. They call that controlled oil sepage. The brake system is over engineered and require nitrogen spheres to help with the brakes.  And the rear suspension also. They will leak also leak / and require new fully charged spheres or your brake pressure light will come on your dash. They also require special brake fluid . Of you put the wrong one in it will contaminate the brake system and require all brake parts in the car to be flushed and replaced.,Bentley

Eventually I had three ducks, all of which I passed to other Jeeps that had something unique about them. I'm not a big fan of the duck craze.*

"The UK auto industry has a complicated history in and of itself. The two companies, although sister companies, were run differently. Bentley was always the performance brand, Rolls being the ultimate luxury. When the company was put on the auction block, BMW showed interest. Rolls Royce management had a cozy relationship with BMW. BMW wanted to move production to Germany. Most management would not abide by this, and it created a lot of turmoil. They also didn't like the ideas BMW purposed for revamping the Bentley brand, and it was speculated they would just sell off Bentley, or let it die. Around the time, VW had acquired Bugatti, so they swooped in, and made a bid for Bentley as well. They promised to keep production in Crewe, and stay true to the identity of the brand. Bentley said yes, and the tug-o-war for Rolls began 😂. VW acquired the plant, and suppliers Rolls Royce used. BMW purchased the rights to the grille (which is trademarked) and the logo. They immediately prohibited the use of both. VW obviously couldn't sell a Rolls without the grille and logo, so they had to acquiesce and an uneasy alliance was formed.

Eventually, an agreement was met. The two companies were divided. VW agreed to sell off their ownership of Rolls to BMW, while keeping everything in Crewe. BMW took all the tooling for the RR cars, and moved production over to Sussex, England where they would develop the Phantom.

In the end, Zi Germans were the best thing that happened to both brands.",Bentley
"Thank you very much! That is very true about budgeting for the major expenses. It’s just had a replacement engine fitted (actually an Arnage T engine from 2006), and the suspension is currently being rebuilt as I type this, so I’m hoping those two will be the major risks covered.

Or if you want a coupe CL 55 SL 55 (not SLK or CLK 55 as they’re nice but not supercharged). My bad, I’ll end my Ted talk after this lol. CLS 55’s look pretty cool, and they’re a one year only car in 2006. That would be cool and rare, and ALL these would be so much more car for the money, than buying something like this.

"Hello and thank you in advance for any help. An extended relative was, in his lifetime, a Bentley lover, owner, and racer. He showed me this photo years ago and I thought I might be able to have it colorized to pass on to his family. I'd love to learn what color it was originally. Can anyone narrow down my search by telling me what year/model this car is, and even better, whether you know what colors they were available in?",Bentley
Good eye. Thanks a lot,Bentley
"Green Labels and Birkins were all powered by the BMW M62 with twin turbos. Red Labels were powered by the 6.75L with a single turbo, and a revamped version with twin turbos beginning in 2001. The early cars with the BMW engines are much friendlier to service and cheaper to maintain. Most parts can be found at any BMW dealer or supplier, and the M62 is reliable. Also the cars were initially designed to house the M62, and the M72 V12 in the Rolls Silver Seraph cousin, so us mechanics appreciate the layout and ease of comfort to service.

Red Label cars reverted to the old 6.75L because BMW and VW couldn't get along during the takeover lol. BMW had threatened to pull their engine supply if there was a complete VW takeover of both brands. So VW had Bentley revert to the old engine, which was inferior but got the job done. Eventually, BMW kept RR, and VW would keep Bentley. At one point, VW had more stake in RR, but BMW owned the rights to the logo and grille and wouldn't permit their use. 😂 It was tumultuous times at Crewe in the late 90's. 

Once VW had full control of the Bentley brand, they told BMW to kick rocks, and completely revamped the 6.75L. Giving it twin turbos, and eventually the ZF 6hp26 transmission. These cars perform much more admirably than the ""last resort"" Red Label cars, but they are much more of a pain to service and maintain as they used all the legacy Bentley parts with bespoke turbos by Cosworth. For enthusiasts, the early cars powered by the BMW V8's are just the better overall deal from an ownership perspective.",Bentley

"Yes, the Mulsanne stands out by a lot compared to all the other models, for 3 reasons:
1) It’s the first model to be entirely designed by Bentley in 80 years since the 8 Litre from 1930;
2) It sports the 6.75 litre V8, an engine with a prehistoric architecture dating back to the 1950s, that still held up over decades, even against the much more modern BMW/Rolls-Royce 6.75 litre V12 and the Mercedes-AMG 6 litre V12. Just like a crocodile from the Miocene against the lion prides of today.

The Mulsanne is truly one of the most authentic cars ever made. And so will it go down in automotive history.",Bentley

As for the cost of course the dealer is very expensive. At the time I just didn’t have the time to do anything myself.

"They are laborious to work on, and parts can be almost criminally expensive. They also use BSW, and BSF fasteners, which are almost impossible to find stateside. They are also very expensive, and in short supply if you do. So that means if a bolt or fastener  strips or breaks, or is FUBAR on removal, you're drilling, tapping, and retreading for American fasteners. Again, just more to the labor costs. It's not so much they are unreliable, but owners just cannot, or refuse to spend the appropriate amount of money to get them fixed right.

Then there is the detail of quality of parts. A lot of stuff is now discontinued. So you're either dealing with used parts, or recondition parts. Which the latter, might as well be polished up junk. When I added Bentley to my line up of vehicles I service, I got a 90 Turbo R to serve as a billboard car. The water pump failed, and I couldn't really source a reputable replacement. Everything was used or reconditioned. I purchased a reconditioned, and it started leaking after only a handful of start ups. I ended up taking a water pump for a small block Chevy, gutting it out, and swapping the shaft, and seal over. I learned that the original pump was supplied by GM as a custom order for Bentley. Figured the internals would be the same. GM is good about scavenging. Worked like a charm lol. These are the types of nuances customers either don't want to pay for, or can't afford to pay for.

The fuel injection system is also a bit of a pain, because you need expensive equipment to dial it in just right. On the turbo cars, this is especially important. I was very blessed that a lot of those tools were passed down to me by my dad. Otherwise, it would have been a hefty investment for a lot of second hand tools.",Bentley

You can find some with 50k miles for about $40k depending on packages it may run higher. If you want a convertible, I'd look into an M4 or an M6. M8 would be the biggest convertible they make but comes with a really high price tag.",Bentley

"A friend had one, around the same year. Just past the warranty date the motor that opens the convertible top died, which IIRC required a new top in addition to a new motor. Either way, it was a $35,000 repair. That is NOT a typo. He traded it in on the spot for a new one, this time a lease I think. 

Cool cars, but I wouldn't touch one. There are many other convertible options that are more reliable and probably more fun and cost less to own. You could probably get a lightly used 3 series a couple of years old for around $40K.",Bentley

"Vacuum lines are a notorious issue on the higher mile 1st gens and more often than not require engine removal to get to all of them which is expensive due to labor. 

The convertible tops tend to to tear and fray with age, thats cost about what the car is worth in parts alone.

Valve covers leak, EGT sensors go bad, air struts start to leak or go out which is about 4k per strut before labor, front control arms, spark plugs, and that's just the stuff I can think of off the top of my head. 

Honestly, I wouldn't buy a 1st gen especially a convertible unless it was much lower miles or had EMACULATE service records. A lot of people buy them at auctions or second hand for ""a steal"" then when something breaks or take it in for service they are shocked by how much parts and repairs are. I've quoted more than a handful of estimates that cost the same or a lot more than what the car costs or is worth. Keep in mind that generation of Bentley is 15-20 years old. So while parts availability is pretty good now, some OE stuff is discontinued and expect it only to continue to decline.

Personally, if you can swing the price I would look at a 2nd gen, they have their problems but are not nearly as troublesome because they are newer and don't have some of the mechanical flaws of the 1st gen.",Bentley
"This is true. Pretty sure there’s a saying w/ Porsche enthusiasts “I don’t like the Cayenne, but it funds my 911” or something along those lines…. It is a double-edged sword however.

These cars are very new so should be reliable. There’s always a chance of failures which will be expensive. Typically with a car this new it’s a crapshoot.

I bought one myself last year. Mine had 47,xxx miles at the time of purchase and the head gasket blew after a 2989 miles road trip (that ended early…) Thankfully under a partial dealer warranty.

Oh, and some sort of recovery/ tow service, like AA or the RAC. 

I have since completed a hassle free 5,000 miles over my honey moon, within 2 months and have had no issues.

That era of VW, they went through a tough stretch in build quality. At the time VW had acquired Johnson Control, and they were a huge supplier of plastics to the auto industry. But around the late 2000's, they started to turn it around. Really upped the build quality. They aren't perfect, but huge leap from those 9/11 era cars.",Bentley

"I have a 2007 GTC. I’ll give you my pros and cons. Pros:  The biggest pro is the way this car makes me feel every time I get into it. It’s the best “pro” a car can offer IMO. I absolutely love driving this car with the top down. I almost never put it up TBH.  It’s a really handsome ride and is definitely a head turner.  You will hear comments, get thumbs up, and occasionally have someone ask to take a picture with the car. The car is heavy and it feels heavy, which I like. It’s a nice smooth ride.  Love the sound system. Beautiful wood grain and leather interior which I still admire. The engine is powerful and the car is surprisingly fast, especially at speed (I’ll list the engine lag from 0 in the cons).  I love the auto close doors.  Don’t need to slam the doors in a Bentley.  The car pulls it shut for you. Great feature. Awesome seats. They’re practically a work of art. Beautiful leather and very adjustable. Great seats. I’ve had this 2007 for a long time and I still get a kick seeing the car in the garage.  It’s just pretty.  In total I really enjoy the driving experience. Very different than driving my other cars.  Satisfying. 

Cons:  Yes repairs are expensive. I haven’t had to repair anything major yet but almost anything costs a lot.  Most recent, four new tires were $2500. But tires for any car in this class will cost a lot.  I’ll have brakes next and that will cost…a lot. Find an independent exotic car repair shop instead of the dealer. I called three, asked them to propose an annual maintenance plan, and picked the one I liked the best. 

The car is powerful, but there is an brief annoying lag from standstill.  It is brief, but it still makes me wish it clutched slightly quicker.  But hey, it’s a Bentley not a Ferrari.  

The batteries are a problem. You will have dead batteries if you aren’t careful.  The batteries are accessed in the trunk, so I bought the required battery tender, hooked it up, and secured it neatly inside the trunk. Then I hang the plug tail out the back so I don’t have to open the trunk every time to plug it in.  Every time I come home, I plug the extension in and voila…no more battery discharge issues. Is that ridiculous?  Yes. But owning cars in this class is ridiculous to begin with so this is what we do. 

Interior controls are tedious. No bluetooth connectivity, so you’re listening to the CD changer or the radio.  You’re answering your phone on your Bluetooth earpiece instead of through the car. No usable navigation on the 2007 so It’s google maps on your phone instead. No built in usb ports. I plug a USB adapter into the center port so I can charge my phone. Works fine.  The interior controls are old and clunky.  Very outdated by 2023 standards.  Multiple button pushes to access climate control, for example. Then you have to select the audio function separately to make changes to that.  Then back again. It’s just old tech. The climate control itself is fine.  It’s just all the manual button pushes that’s a hassle.  Do I feel silly complaining that I have too many buttons to push in my Bentley?  Yes.  But you asked.  And I can’t get my garage doors to sync with the car, so I clip the garage opener onto the visor.   Eh. Fine. Oh also, No backup camera in the 2007.  That’s the thing that is most irritating. It’s sure not life changing, but I wish it had a backup camera.  C’est la vie. 

Overall, I adore this vehicle. As old as it is, I still love driving this car every single time.",Bentley

The Mulsanne probably has argueably the nicer interior overall but I absolutely hate the mulsannes dashboard/gauges/ all the buttons around the shifter compared to the flying spur.

"Complex proprietary systems(hydraulics as the best example) that were developed without the budget to engineer and build them more robustly.

Cheaper maintenance, is maintenance that people are more likely to keep up with. That’s the why.

"In the US at least, real 2 seat cars (but not trucks), usually have higher insurance rates.  Not sure if there are other factors, such as additional duties, such as luxury taxes, etc at play that specify higher costs for true 2 seaters.  (Insurance rationale is that 2 seaters are typically sports cars and higher risk of accidents and greater severity of damages, typically)

In the 80s at least, this was the reason for manufacturers to add nominal seating in the back.  

Porsche, et al have maintained this practice for this same reason, I suspect.",Bentley

"Not a friggin chance that the average mileage of a 80’s RR is higher than that of 80’s ford of ANY model.  Sure many Fords are disposable but that’s usually at well over 100k miles. I’d bet the farm that the vast majority of RR’s  have well under 100k miles. This is simply apples to oranges. Also can we talk about how a RR in the 80’s was like 5-10 times the cost of a Ford or a Toyota?  So this just a ridiculous comparison.  And when you factor in purchase price and average longevity, never mind necessary service intervals and cost of ownership, there is simply no logical case that the RR is a more reliable or economical vehicle to purchase. It’s status luxury plain and simple. Bought for the status symbol and coach aesthetics. Any case for it being anything more is malarkey.",Bentley

If you’re in the states then it is illegal for the dealership to void a factory warranty if the vehicle was serviced at another registered service center with all work being done in good faith. The challenge is providing documentation in the event of an issue showing the alternative dealership met or exceeded the service that Bentley would have done otherwise Bentley would argue you did not fulfill the required conditions for the warranty to remain valid.,Bentley

"It's still a scam (though quasi legal) registering your car in a state you don't have a residence in.  Most states require your vehicles to be registered in the state you primarily live in.  However, if the emissions issue was serious enough of a problem to a car I want to own, I would do the same thing. 

Avoiding taxes and fees you should be paying is just wrong, particularly for the wealthy that tend to do it with extremely expensive exotic cars.  No state should be allowed to collect sales tax again if it had already been paid for elsewhere for those vehicles.",Bentley

Luckily most of the problems you list aren’t problems to me because I’ve been driving a C3 corvette 😂. I had my head gasket blow and coolant pipe explode. So any issues I’m sure are less complex however yes I would still need a specialized mechanic as I’m unfamiliar with British Cars. And yes the lag is acceptable as it is a Bentley not a Ferrari.

"I should’ve explained the role of banks too, super important.

Banks create money when they lend the money that depositors entrust to them.  If the government invests/spends a dollar into the economy, then someone gets paid that dollar and either all or a portion of it eventually goes into a bank via spending and saving.  A bank can then loan out that same *single* dollar 5-10 times.  As one can imagine, these borrowed funds then make their way into the economy and eventually to other banks, in which case that bank can now create even more money.  Banks don’t need paper money to make loans; only 3% of money is still old-fashioned currency while the other 97% is just numbers on a screen.

It isn’t political.  It’s just mathematics.  That’s why it’s so beautiful and easy to follow.",Bentley
These cars are notorious for the plastic vacuum lines located above the transmission that can break.  My understanding is that the only way to get at to fix them is to take the engine out of the car.

Unlimited mileage warranty is vague for sure. Ring around other mechs too get price to replace head gasket so you have ball park figure, ask what their process is if they drop or replace in situe, I suspect drop. Anarge engine is proper big. Check out replacement bits on autodoc and try flyingspurs parts too. I would be looking at £4k if the warranty isn't covered. Good look dude.",Bentley

In retrospect I might have been tempted by a Bentayga Speed with the W12 engine, which is meant to have a bit more character and Bentley charm.  
  
The Arnage is kind of in its own category, nothing like any other car I’ve ever driven - a proper old school Bentley. Too big to be allowed, ridiculously fast for its size, comfy and lovely, unparkable in the UK 😂.",Bentley
"Same for me! Even better than a Maybach or Rolls. It’s just on another level. Plus, it’s a beautiful spec and color (Oceanica configuration over Dark Sapphire blue if I’m not mistaken), with open pore cut Walnut and Côtes de Geneve central console finish. Just mind blowing",Bentley

"Wow, congrats on your possible purchase. I bought a 2016 Conti Convertible with 20,000 miles and Its the best vehicle I've ever owned. I did basic due diligence, in hindsight I should have done more, but got lucky. Pre-owned authorized vehicles have a limited warrantee right? This is my 2nd used Bentley and these cars are worth every bit of the money they cost. Not at all delicate or temperamental, in my experience. I just drove mine from Seattle to Las Vegas (1500 miles) without so much as an oil change first, and this car ran better at the end of the trip than even the beginning. Felt like it was just getting settled in, when we arrived. These cars obviously need to be driven. I'm even more impressed now, esp since so many car dudes told me not to drive it, but to ship it. I haven't had one issue with this car, mechanical or otherwise. If you can buy one that is so new, go for it. That's my next goal. Good luck!",Bentley

"The Bentayga is an SUV, a totally different type of car. It’s the first SUV ever from Bentley (actually the second after the Dominator, but the first to be mass produced), so it’s in a category of its own.

Also yes, the Flying Spur was launched in 2004, a couple years after the Continental GT in 2003, and it’s like the saloon version of the Continental itself. 

On the other hand, the Mulsanne was launched in 2010 to replace the Arnage, and these 2 belonged in the lane of those models that still retained Rolls-Royce/Bentley merger parts from the Vickers ownership era (Mulsanne, Turbo R, Continental R, Azure, Brooklands, etc.). All those models had in common the 6.75 litre V8, and we can say that non-VW technology Bentley model lane ended in June 2020 when the 6.75 litre V8 was phased out (it has been produced for 61 years).",Bentley

"I just bought a 2007 CGT with double the mileage for half that price, with about $2-3k in repairs needed after purchase which is why it was at a discounted rate, so I think you may want to keep searching for a better deal for this model. I bought it knowing I would be spending some money on repairs, but it was such a great deal I knew I had some room to spend. At $20k, I am not stressing - if I spent $40k, I would be bummed to own this old of a vehicle, even with less mileage. If you can afford it, I would wait for the newer model you can afford, or try to find a cheaper \~07.  


My research led me to believe 07 onwards were the only worthwhile ones, with the 04-06 having more serious risk and issues that require a full engine drop for too many things like the vacuum lines. Don't take my word for it though as there is mixed info in here on it.   


I did lots of research here + online and concluded that it will be a pain to own at times, but as something on my bucket list, I felt like I would rather just get one I can afford now and spend some on repairs versus waiting a few more years (as I have been putting this purchase off for like 7 years already and just celebrated 10 years of my company and wanted to buy this as a milestone reward.).  


Hope this helps!",Bentley
I'd like to offer to you the Honda S2000.,Bentley
"You know what’s funny is a friend of mine with an 05 GT had the vacuum line issue with the car not going faster then 20 mph and shops were quoting him 3-5k minimum with an engine out and one of my warehouse employees was able to replace the line in one day using my lift with the engine in. Total material cost was $28 and labor was another $184. The maintenance isn’t too bad if someone actually tries. With that said I do recommend second gen only, first has a lot of funny electrical problems",Bentley

"Big costs are vacuum hoses, camshaft sensors, boost sensors just as a few examples, you have to drop the engine circa 5k in labour plus parts. Just to replace a cheap part. You can get the parts cheap but the labour charge is the labour charge.  Check the roof liner isn't sagging, check that all the bits work like buttons and electrics. You can pick up check modules from breakers cheap. An example TV decoder for dab if you don't have one is 200, easy to fit yourself. Switches and buttons and even control modules are cheap used from eBay. Brakes and exhausts are normal prices nothing exciting there. When it comes to engine parts buy new, but don't always buy Bentley remember some electrical sensors or parts are just glorified VW parts, Bosch parts or continental parts, don't always go with Bentley branded. But don't skimp on cheap parts either. Subject to use keep 2500 a year back for parts. Do a full diagnostic scan with odb to make sure you're not buying a dud.",Bentley

Oil changes and services (annual) are around $2k per. That usually includes the inspection. 

Tires...one goes, you replace all four that's $2000. Can't rotate them. Last about 10000 miles. 

Someone damaged the trunk badge tears ago. $1100 just for the badge. 

Current issue is a slow air leak in front passenger strut. Bentley recommends replacing both fronts at the same time. $6k for one, $10k for both. It's not a bigbissue right now but eventually I will need to address it....probably this year.

I'm guessing I've easily put $35k into maintenance over the last 6 years. Every service is 3+ weeks. I have to have it trucked to the dealer. Easily $200k all in.

"Let’s look at the top three items comprising just $60b of the $100b and see who is benefitting most from the spending.

$30b for Pentagon equipment: $30b spent by the Federal government on U.S.-made military equipment and personnel.  This means employing Americans to make U.S.-made military products that are then used by other Americans who are employed by the U.S. government to use them in service of supporting the mission.

$14b for Pentagon intelligence: employing Americans to provide a service to an ally nation using U.S.-made equipment.  Again, U.S.-made equipment is made by Americans employed by U.S. companies like Lockheed Martin, RTX, Northrop, et alii, and used by Americans employed by the government, specifically the Pentagon in this example.

$16b for State Dept.: again, employing Americans to provide a service to Ukraine using U.S.-made equipment.

Furthermore, all of this demand/spending created by the Federal government drives up and/or maintains the value of the stock of said U.S. companies as well as thousands of others tied to military industrial complex funding.  I think we can all extrapolate the benefits of a healthy NYSE and Nasdaq.

Last, it’s so important to remember is that these are not tax dollars being spent—we’re not talking state spending here.  The Federal government creates economy by spending and then checks us via taxation.  The Federal government does not need taxes to spend.  The Federal government is the original spender.

Hope this helps!",Bentley

I did and they charged an arm and a leg. What is annoying is that the battery has a part number of 915105 which is also used in other VAG vehicles. The same battery that has an Audi logo on it goes for $180ish online. The Bentley battery MRSP is 4x that. And labor is just as expensive.,Bentley

No I didn’t spec it myself. Not sure what had happened, but whoever spec’d it threw it back at the dealer (unregistered, no miles on the clock, so assume he/she had a change of financial circumstances or something during the order being built). We’ve been in the market for one for a while, and liked the spec on this, and ended up getting about £35k off the list price in the end (and a free Bentley tricycle!).

Some drive through lanes are difficult to navigate due to space constraints but this is definitely poor driving.,Bentley
"Lots of speculation in here, not much actual owner experience though. Here's mine, but first some caveats:

\- Mine is a later model Turbo R from 1996, so not strictly 80s, but it's very similar to the original '85 version.

\- Significant difference is that mine has an electronic fuel injection system rather than the Bosch K-Jetronic system (or even the original SU carbs) used in the 80s

\- Mine also has the later 4L80-E transmission instead of the old TH400, though that has no real bearing on reliability other than the engine revving lower at motorway cruising speeds.

\- I also live in the UK, where there seem to be a lot more knowledgeable mechanics to work on these and parts are easier to get hold of.

I've owned the car for just over two and a half years and in that time it has never not started first time, and has never failed to proceed. I spent a lot on it in the first 18 months on deferred maintenance and getting it properly sorted, since then I've been spending a lot less.

Servicing really isn't that big a deal, oil and filter change every year, transmission fluid and filter every three. There's a hydraulics one at some point but it's not that frequent. I drive the car every couple of weeks, it's really important to use these cars. Problems happen when they sit around.

People always love bringing up Hoovie, but his experience really isn't typical. He buys cars for content at the end of the day, and a perfectly good example isn't going to get many clicks. It's interesting to contrast his Turbo R even with a Silver Spirit that Car Wizard had on his channel, he talks a very different tune about the Crewe cars on that one. Matt Farah and Jay Leno's videos show what happens when you have a decent one and look after it.

As for high mileages, these are luxury cars so don't rack up the miles as much as others, but there are people with well over a quarter of a million miles on these without any engine rebuilds etc. The L series V8 is a massive understressed lump, and as long as the oil is changed annually will last and last and last. There's no belts or chains to worry about.

Honestly these cars are just very special, well built from quality materials and are unlike anything else. If they have been neglected they can be troublesome, if not they are bomb proof - which is not unlike a lot of cars really.",Bentley

"> If you're buying a Bentley why would you worry about practicality?

Because a Bentley is supposed to be practical. We're not talking about Lamborghini.

> I felt like the Bentayga cheapened the brand, but I'm not the head of a car company, either. The W12 Flying Spur really represented the brand to me in modern times just because I felt like it embodied the spirit of Bentley more than any other model since the Arnage

The Bentayga saved Bentley. VAG executives threatened Bentley in 2019 if they weren't profitable within two years. Without it the Flying Spur would've embodied the spirit of financial trouble that Bentley's also familiar with. The reality is you can't survive as a modern car company without an SUV. VAG leadership is also ruthless, so Bentley needs to generate profit unless they want to find another suitor. 

I don't like SUVs in general, but I quite like what they've done with the Bentayga. The interior is last gen - more reminiscent of the mkII Continental GT and Flying Spur, but I still think it's beautiful.",Bentley

"The Mulsanne was so cool, as the last “Big-Body Bentley,” on its own platform. That said, it had the Audi electrical architecture, so all the electronics were reskinned versions of the same ones that were in my 2013 A8 L 4.0T (this isn’t a bad thing).

Interestingly, even the core of the steering wheel is the same as the contemporary Audi 4-spoke. The Bentley one looks different because it’s got a circular boss/airbag cover, but it’s the same. I imagine the button packs also have the same circuit boards, under the skin (albeit with different lighting colors)",Bentley

"Also, take the engine out and fully take it apart. Check every little screw to make sure it’s fine. 
Then strip it to its shell, check every square inch for rust and if fine put it all back together. 
I would also replace the engine and transmission right away so you know you’re good. If you can, hire a full time mechanic so they can look over the car daily. 
Save about 19 thousand dollars monthly for small repairs like air filter replacement. Yearly expenses should be roughly 250k. 

But in all seriousness, if you want it buy it. Don’t listen to all these people. They’re just trying to scare you not to buy the car because they can’t. 
When I inquired about buying one same experts were telling me the same thing. 
I’ve had the car for 3 years and it’s cost me maybe 4k to keep it running just fine. Don’t replace shit until it breaks. If you do what these people say, you’ll spend thousands before even driving it for the first time. Have Bentley look at it and do a PPI and you’ll be fine.",Bentley

"Don't bother with those those people

Some of them probably believe the government should raise the minimum wage at their burger King enough so they could own an 03 arnage",Bentley
"$5 to $10 is created in the economy for every $1 that the Federal government spends.  This means that when they spend $60b on said American jobs and products, then another $300b to $600b is created in the U.S. economy.  Whilst one may not care about employing Americans—although the families with those jobs probably do—that $60b is multiplying and so much more is being created in the U.S. economy by way of related businesses and then the spending of all of said employed Americans, their families, and so on; this means even more employment and earnings for Americans than were directly tied to the original dollar amount spent by the Federal government.  It’s easiest to think of Fed spending as investing, rather than spending in the traditional personal sense, since the Fed’s spending is limited by metrics like inflation, rather than a dollar limit, which doesn’t exist, except as instituted by politicians.

For an historical example, let’s think of the economic boom created in the U.S. by WWII.  The country continued to deal with the fallout of the Great Depression until something like $4t or $5t was spent by the Fed (adjusted for inflation).  The majority of which was spent employing Americans to make American products.  This government spending in tandem with government-mandated price controls finally allowed the economy to recover and led to the resurgence of a strong stock market—the Dow was up 130% in four years.  Moreover, embracing spending instead of austerity helped keep the cost of living for Americans from rising some 40% less than occurred during WWI.

The U.S. doesn’t accomplish this type of economic growth by employing foreign workers and paying them in dollars nor by employing Americans in a foreign currency.  There’s vast historical economic precedent for why ‘American Made’ receives such a consistent ovation.

Unfortunately, there have been several points in U.S. history when politicians have projected the need for a balanced household budget onto the Federal budget; it’s frustrating that politicians don’t have to understand basic economics to be elected.  But by no means does a balanced budget for the average American equate to the Federal government.  People are able to create economy once we have the currency, but we can only do so if sufficient currency is in circulation.  The monetary sovereign (Federal gov) must first spend in order to create economy, which is then controlled via taxation to solve for problems like inflation.  If the government were to ‘balance its books’ in the household sense by way of reducing the money in circulation (i.e. the economy), then taxes go up, business and personal spending goes down, and the economy recedes and/or depresses.  Without a healthy economy fuelled by the spending of the monetary sovereign, which supports high levels of employment (but never over-employment) wherein people are being paid and spending (=growing economy), then it doesn’t matter how much is in the right pocket (Fed gov), because the left pocket (Americans) aren’t getting anything out of it.

That said, rather than pocket to pocket, it’s likely easier to think of the economy as a sink that we want to keep just perfectly full of water.  The gov turns on spending via the faucet.  If there’s too much spending flowing into the sink, then we need to open the drain via taxes as to avoid dollars spilling over the top of the sink and loosing value because there’s so much (i.e. inflation).  With the right amount of water/spending flowing in and out of the sink, due to a balance between incoming and outgoing dollars from the economy, then we’re maximising the number of people in said economy who have opportunity to benefit as well as increase the amount that they’re able to benefit, and then feed back into the economy—the cycle continues!  :)",Bentley

"100% for sales and marketing.  
The simple truth is that car companies know you won’t use the back seats much, but they also know many buyers can’t justify a pure two-seater — so the back seats help convince them that it isn’t as impractical as, say, a Ferrari 488. No, they’re not the most usable, or the easiest to climb into, but they may help convince potential buyers who want to use an exotic car more frequently than just once a month — and if the back seats have scored any sales, they’re worth putting in for that reason alone.",Bentley

"I inherited my dad’s 2008 GTC about six months ago. It had been sitting for about a year in a garage in Florida. So far I have about $10,000 into it. Had to change both front air struts and had a leaky roof that allowed water into the back seat and corroded the electronics in the trunk. I do a lot of my own work, so I was able to save some money, but parts are outrageously expensive. Just the two rear roof seals were $3000 and very hard to find. Aftermarket front struts are easy to find and cross reference with VW and Audi, which are the exact same part without the Bentley sticker. Hood and trunk struts were shot but easy to buy and install. Seat memory doesn’t work so far. Sound system is quite dated so I installed a dash and switch update that allows a double din radio which worked out well, had to also change the backup camera for compatibility.  W12 engine in sport mode is fast and burbles nicely when off the gas pedal, handles quite well for a heavy car.   Definitely find a good independent shop, dealer shop will empty your pockets fast.",Bentley

"An E38? I thought you were going to say an E65. Was it a V8 or a V12? The M62 doesn't really give major problems. The horseshoe timing guide is the biggest offender. The rear plate doesn't fail as frequently as the N63, and the upper crossover pipe can be replaced with the engine mounted in the vehicle. It doesn't use the goofy alternator bracket seal like on the N series either. Only the lines that go to the remote mounted oil filter housing. That can be replaced in vehicle as well. M73 V12 ain't much different. Throttle bodies are an expensive failure on those. 

The fuel line you speak of is the evap fuel tank vent line (purge valve) to the engine. Another easy fix. They also have the breather hosing that BMW updated with an improved design, and M62/73's still have the shitty valve stem seals BMW has been using forever.",Bentley

So far so good. That being said ,it's my second Bentley and buying this car was one of the best decisions I ever made. Driving this car, owning this car has added a ton of joy to my life.",Bentley

"I took this photo at Festival of Speed at the Avalon mall in Alpharetta Georgia. If anyone is interested, you can see all the photos I took of this car and many others, here: https://youtu.be/X8ZS-UyCyV8",Bentley
If you buy it you better be buying it for love of the car and are in it for the long haul. The maintenance costs alone are going to be a b*tch. Then consider what will happen if something fails. You can find these pretty cheap for a reason.,Bentley
