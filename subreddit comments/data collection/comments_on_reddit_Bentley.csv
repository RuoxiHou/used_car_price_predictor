"If you go this route, find the most recent model year within your budget and opt for the V-8.  The V-8 has more room in the engine bay than the W-12 (looking at you coil packs).  Most things can be worked on but there will be things where it will need to go to a shop (especially if you don‚Äôt have a lift available to you).  Not certain if still the case but on older Continental GT‚Äôs, the front quarter panels have to be removed to replace the headlight bulbs if they go out.  Most bugaboos will be in the electronics than the engine/drivetrain which are fairly robust.",Bentley

"My dream is to go on a road trip, socal to east coast with one of these üòÄ",Bentley
"To be fair the main reason shops price it out that way is because it's a spiderweb of individual lines and fittings, so chasing down the singular problem line is time consuming. Then its the matter of getting to that line to replace it, some are easy and others not at all. Lastly, if you are replacing one line that was dry rotted/cracked from age, there are likely several others not far behind it and so fragile they could be damaged during the repair. Shops and dealers are very much on the side of ""all or nothing"" because its very easily a job that could have to be redone if only done piece meal.

And thats dope your guy was able to do that! If he is able to get back in there and add som heat insulation or heat tape that will help the repair go the distance for sure!",Bentley

"Yes, I hope to not be in the shop often, that would be terrible. Sadly the v8 continentals came out 2012+ they are slightly out of my price range, but if it saves on repairs it may be something to consider. Thank You.",Bentley
I‚Äôm sure this won‚Äôt be a popular opinion but imo it‚Äôs the lack of onboard computer diagnostics people really take that obd port and it‚Äôs many features for granted. These old girls can be very very difficult to diagnose they have a lot of complicated systems and a lack of feedback loops to ensure they are operating properly. Couple that with comically awful British electronics and wiring diagrams that are incorrect and you have a car that is not only unreliable but now is incredibly difficult to fix compounding the unreliability problem,Bentley

Overhyped BMW with flashy status and badging . . .,Bentley
"It‚Äôs because the Mulsanne was totally designed by Bentley with little to no VW parts. And probably it was meant to be the final model of all the Rolls-Royce/Bentley saloons produced during the Vickers ownership era. Hence why the interior looks very similar to how it is in models like Brooklands, Azure, Continental R, Turbo R, etc.",Bentley

He absolutely flipped the fuck out and left very quickly.   complete douche - I had to laugh.

"Use 95 (98RON) as I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre in Europe. If you‚Äôre driving a Bentley $50 a fill up shouldn‚Äôt change a lot.

Using a lower octane makes the engine work harder, hurts your mileage, and long term can hurt your vehicle. This is the same across all luxury vehicles, they‚Äôre high compression engines so they need higher octane to run efficiently.",Bentley

"Recommend going with a 2012. A bit pricier but still gives you the updated look, better infotainment and similar maintenance cost.

"Tire wheel coverage as noted - Extended warranty through Bentley.

Going over  bump and destroying a wheel is a fast was to lose 5k.

Make sure all windows function normally during top open and close scenarios. Most common issue I‚Äôve seen on them are faults relating to these. Get maintenance records in detail and ensure the top has not been replaced, if it has make sure frame was as well and everything functions. 

Top replacements on these are $60,000 at dealer.

Get measurements for all wear and tear items (brakes and tires) to use that to negotiate if needed.

All that, ensure maintenance was done, and enjoy! One of the best coupes ever made, if not the best. Engines are rock solid.

These luxury car subs are wild. GenZ and your first car and your asking if you can make it 6 months without needing a repair?

"My guess is that someone bought it cheap because they lose their value so quickly, then something broke that was way too expensive for the person's budget.",Bentley
"Probably because having the interior (especially the driver and front passenger space) all covered up in wood and leather would be a lot more expensive, and this is what the Mulsanne was all about (like the Brooklands, Azure, Arnage, etc.). Not to mention how many days, not to say weeks, it would take to be built, that also wouldn‚Äôt help (especially if you need to pay your employees to hand-build your cars). Here‚Äôs why newer models have more plastic in the interior, including the Flying Spur.

Then combine the already expensive production costs of the Mulsanne with the pandemic that happened in 2020, that caused shortages of semiconductors (a vital part of most if not all modern cars), which in their turn slowed down the production of a lot of cars. Also add the fact that they need to pay annual taxes, and their income dropped too much to keep up with taxation.

I think this is the reason why Bentley decided to stop making the Mulsanne for good.",Bentley

Unless you are willing to try yourself.  Dealers and some independents said I needed to drop the engine to do camshaft sensors, which I didn't. Don't believe what they say.

The alternative was that VAG were to going to lay off about 90% and move all production except special orders to Germany. That was the middle ground option with the worst case being selling off Bentley.

As for rip-off pricing, they're comparable to their competitors and offer a product none of them can even come close to in terms of interior design, material quality, and the combination of luxury and performance. (For this purpose I'm not considering Rolls Royce a competitor because of their pricing.) If you want to spend less money you'll be getting a compromised product in terms of customization options, materials, and the combination of power and comfort.

"Combination of all of those. Cars like Bentley, Rolls, and Maybach tend to be overbuilt. So they use more fasteners in places other manufacturers use clips for example. More work to disassemble. They also require special tooling. For example you need a special wrench to remove the front bumper on the Flying Spur in this subreddit. The tool used to cost north of 300.00. When the facelift versions came out, *a different tool* was required. That's more $$$ to invest. Then comes the cost of support. I pay 12k a year for access to their wiring diagrams, and repair information. In comparison, the yearly sub for BMW ISTA is $2500. 

You got to pay to play with these vehicles. That's why a lot of shops don't mess with them, out side of specialists.",Bentley

"I own this car. 2007. Here is what I posted to another user who was asking this same question. Pasting‚Ä¶

I have a 2007 GTC. I‚Äôll give you my pros and cons. Pros:  The biggest pro is the way this car makes me feel every time I get into it. It‚Äôs the best ‚Äúpro‚Äù a car can offer IMO. I absolutely love driving this car with the top down. I almost never put it up TBH.  It‚Äôs a really handsome ride and is definitely a head turner.  You will hear comments, get thumbs up, and occasionally have someone ask to take a picture with the car. The car is heavy and it feels heavy, which I like. It‚Äôs a nice smooth ride.  Love the sound system. Beautiful wood grain and leather interior which I still admire. The engine is powerful and the car is surprisingly fast, especially at speed (I‚Äôll list the engine lag from 0 in the cons).  I love the auto close doors.  Don‚Äôt need to slam the doors in a Bentley.  The car pulls it shut for you. Great feature. Awesome seats. They‚Äôre practically a work of art. Beautiful leather and very adjustable. Great seats. I‚Äôve had this 2007 for a long time and I still get a kick seeing the car in the garage.  It‚Äôs just pretty.  In total I really enjoy the driving experience. Very different than driving my other cars.  Satisfying.

Cons:  Yes repairs are expensive. I haven‚Äôt had to repair anything major yet but almost anything costs a lot.  Most recent, four new tires were $2500. But tires for any car in this class will cost a lot.  I‚Äôll have brakes next and that will cost‚Ä¶a lot. Find an independent exotic car repair shop instead of the dealer. I called three, asked them to propose an annual maintenance plan, and picked the one I liked the best.

The car is powerful, but there is an brief annoying lag from standstill.  It is brief, but it still makes me wish it clutched slightly quicker.  But hey, it‚Äôs a Bentley not a Ferrari.

The batteries are a problem. You will have dead batteries if you aren‚Äôt careful.  The batteries are accessed in the trunk, so I bought the required battery tender, hooked it up, and secured it neatly inside the trunk. Then I hang the plug tail out the back so I don‚Äôt have to open the trunk every time to plug it in.  Every time I come home, I plug the extension in and voila‚Ä¶no more battery discharge issues. Is that ridiculous?  Yes. But owning cars in this class is ridiculous to begin with so this is what we do.

Interior controls are tedious. No bluetooth connectivity, so you‚Äôre listening to the CD changer or the radio.  You‚Äôre answering your phone on your Bluetooth earpiece instead of through the car. No usable navigation on the 2007 so It‚Äôs google maps on your phone instead. No built in usb ports. I plug a USB adapter into the center port so I can charge my phone. Works fine.  The interior controls are old and clunky.  Very outdated by 2023 standards.  Multiple button pushes to access climate control, for example. Then you have to select the audio function separately to make changes to that.  Then back again. It‚Äôs just old tech. The climate control itself is fine.  It‚Äôs just all the manual button pushes that‚Äôs a hassle.  Do I feel silly complaining that I have too many buttons to push in my Bentley?  Yes.  But you asked.  And I can‚Äôt get my garage doors to sync with the car, so I clip the garage opener onto the visor.   Eh. Fine. Oh also, No backup camera in the 2007.  That‚Äôs the thing that is most irritating. It‚Äôs sure not life changing, but I wish it had a backup camera.  C‚Äôest la vie.

Overall, I adore this vehicle. As old as it is, I still love driving this car every single time.",Bentley

"Does the warranty cover the head? I remember buying a car with a silver warranty and it didn't cover some turbo hoses. Very much sounds like a head gasket, is there oil dripping from the bottom of the car? If coolant and other bits mixed up there maybe other knackered bits, maybe coolant/water pump, new sparks, to say the least, maybe rads need draining. I once had a mini that needed a new head gasket and needed slight head skim too as it made a small warp mess. I wouldnt expect them to drop the engine unless it's very confined in there, but 5 days to drop and put back plus day to fix the gasket unless there is warp. Couple of weeks tops.

"Many parts are actually of higher quality than a normal car. Lets not forget that a much larger part of Rolls Royces and Bentley's of that age are still driving than Toyota's or Chevy's. It's just that when a 1980's Chevy truck needs a 3.000 dollar repair, it's a total loss.

However, luxury cars usually exist of much more components than normal cars. The more stuff there is on the car, the more stuff can break. This is especially true with more modern luxury cars that have a lot of expensive but fragile electronics on board.

Also, weight matters. Higher weight means more wear and tear on weight bearing components. They will either wear down faster or are of higher quality and therefore more expensive to replace.",Bentley

The Mulsanne has a much nicer interior than the flying spur.  For example the Mulsanne and the Arnage before it have solid wood backing that the decorative veneer is on.

"At that age and mileage, I'm going to guess the vehicle was a business lease, and the owner didn't give a crock, because the vehicle was likely paying for itself. Or rather, whatever stream of income they garnered was paying for the vehicle. 

Hence, the owner said üñïüèΩand put miles on it and paid the penalty. So long as it has a service history you can verify, go for it. 

Outside of that, the real concerns you should have at the moment (depending on market) is the cost of fuel and insurance. These things don't believe in environmentalism I can tell you that, üòÇ and at least here in my area, insurance has become criminal. Just food for thought.",Bentley

"Prices for the W12 skyrocketing isn't likely. Assuming you're talking about the 3rd gen, the Continental/Flying Spur in general should have better residuals than the famously depreciative Phaeton platform cars as they're more desirable but they will (and do) still lose a lot of value, regardless of powertrain. The L series V8, arguably an even more prestigious engine, was also discontinued a few years ago and yet Mulsannes still depreciate quite significantly.

I was a rolls Royce mechanic ( technician ) for the dealership for many years. They leak engine oil from the factory brand new under warranty. They call that controlled oil sepage.

"The UK auto industry has a complicated history in and of itself. The two companies, although sister companies, were run differently. Bentley was always the performance brand, Rolls being the ultimate luxury. When the company was put on the auction block, BMW showed interest. Rolls Royce management had a cozy relationship with BMW. BMW wanted to move production to Germany. Most management would not abide by this, and it created a lot of turmoil. They also didn't like the ideas BMW purposed for revamping the Bentley brand, and it was speculated they would just sell off Bentley, or let it die. Around the time, VW had acquired Bugatti, so they swooped in, and made a bid for Bentley as well. They promised to keep production in Crewe, and stay true to the identity of the brand. Bentley said yes, and the tug-o-war for Rolls began üòÇ. VW acquired the plant, and suppliers Rolls Royce used. BMW purchased the rights to the grille (which is trademarked) and the logo. They immediately prohibited the use of both. VW obviously couldn't sell a Rolls without the grille and logo, so they had to acquiesce and an uneasy alliance was formed.

Eventually, an agreement was met. The two companies were divided. VW agreed to sell off their ownership of Rolls to BMW, while keeping everything in Crewe. BMW took all the tooling for the RR cars, and moved production over to Sussex, England where they would develop the Phantom.

In the end, Zi Germans were the best thing that happened to both brands.",Bentley

"Green Labels and Birkins were all powered by the BMW M62 with twin turbos. Red Labels were powered by the 6.75L with a single turbo, and a revamped version with twin turbos beginning in 2001. The early cars with the BMW engines are much friendlier to service and cheaper to maintain. Most parts can be found at any BMW dealer or supplier, and the M62 is reliable. Also the cars were initially designed to house the M62, and the M72 V12 in the Rolls Silver Seraph cousin, so us mechanics appreciate the layout and ease of comfort to service.

Red Label cars reverted to the old 6.75L because BMW and VW couldn't get along during the takeover lol. BMW had threatened to pull their engine supply if there was a complete VW takeover of both brands. So VW had Bentley revert to the old engine, which was inferior but got the job done. Eventually, BMW kept RR, and VW would keep Bentley. At one point, VW had more stake in RR, but BMW owned the rights to the logo and grille and wouldn't permit their use. üòÇ It was tumultuous times at Crewe in the late 90's. 

Once VW had full control of the Bentley brand, they told BMW to kick rocks, and completely revamped the 6.75L. Giving it twin turbos, and eventually the ZF 6hp26 transmission. These cars perform much more admirably than the ""last resort"" Red Label cars, but they are much more of a pain to service and maintain as they used all the legacy Bentley parts with bespoke turbos by Cosworth. For enthusiasts, the early cars powered by the BMW V8's are just the better overall deal from an ownership perspective.",Bentley

"They are laborious to work on, and parts can be almost criminally expensive. They also use BSW, and BSF fasteners, which are almost impossible to find stateside. They are also very expensive, and in short supply if you do. So that means if a bolt or fastener  strips or breaks, or is FUBAR on removal, you're drilling, tapping, and retreading for American fasteners. Again, just more to the labor costs. It's not so much they are unreliable, but owners just cannot, or refuse to spend the appropriate amount of money to get them fixed right.

Then there is the detail of quality of parts. A lot of stuff is now discontinued. So you're either dealing with used parts, or recondition parts. Which the latter, might as well be polished up junk. When I added Bentley to my line up of vehicles I service, I got a 90 Turbo R to serve as a billboard car. The water pump failed, and I couldn't really source a reputable replacement. Everything was used or reconditioned. I purchased a reconditioned, and it started leaking after only a handful of start ups. I ended up taking a water pump for a small block Chevy, gutting it out, and swapping the shaft, and seal over. I learned that the original pump was supplied by GM as a custom order for Bentley. Figured the internals would be the same. GM is good about scavenging. Worked like a charm lol. These are the types of nuances customers either don't want to pay for, or can't afford to pay for.

The fuel injection system is also a bit of a pain, because you need expensive equipment to dial it in just right. On the turbo cars, this is especially important. I was very blessed that a lot of those tools were passed down to me by my dad. Otherwise, it would have been a hefty investment for a lot of second hand tools.",Bentley

"Vacuum lines are a notorious issue on the higher mile 1st gens and more often than not require engine removal to get to all of them which is expensive due to labor. 

The convertible tops tend to to tear and fray with age, thats cost about what the car is worth in parts alone.

Valve covers leak, EGT sensors go bad, air struts start to leak or go out which is about 4k per strut before labor, front control arms, spark plugs, and that's just the stuff I can think of off the top of my head. 

Honestly, I wouldn't buy a 1st gen especially a convertible unless it was much lower miles or had EMACULATE service records. A lot of people buy them at auctions or second hand for ""a steal"" then when something breaks or take it in for service they are shocked by how much parts and repairs are. I've quoted more than a handful of estimates that cost the same or a lot more than what the car costs or is worth. Keep in mind that generation of Bentley is 15-20 years old. So while parts availability is pretty good now, some OE stuff is discontinued and expect it only to continue to decline.

Personally, if you can swing the price I would look at a 2nd gen, they have their problems but are not nearly as troublesome because they are newer and don't have some of the mechanical flaws of the 1st gen.",Bentley

That era of VW, they went through a tough stretch in build quality. At the time VW had acquired Johnson Control, and they were a huge supplier of plastics to the auto industry. But around the late 2000's, they started to turn it around. Really upped the build quality. They aren't perfect, but huge leap from those 9/11 era cars.",Bentley

"I have a 2007 GTC. I‚Äôll give you my pros and cons. Pros:  The biggest pro is the way this car makes me feel every time I get into it. It‚Äôs the best ‚Äúpro‚Äù a car can offer IMO. I absolutely love driving this car with the top down. I almost never put it up TBH.  It‚Äôs a really handsome ride and is definitely a head turner.  You will hear comments, get thumbs up, and occasionally have someone ask to take a picture with the car. The car is heavy and it feels heavy, which I like. It‚Äôs a nice smooth ride.  Love the sound system. Beautiful wood grain and leather interior which I still admire. The engine is powerful and the car is surprisingly fast, especially at speed (I‚Äôll list the engine lag from 0 in the cons).  I love the auto close doors.  Don‚Äôt need to slam the doors in a Bentley.  The car pulls it shut for you. Great feature. Awesome seats. They‚Äôre practically a work of art. Beautiful leather and very adjustable. Great seats. I‚Äôve had this 2007 for a long time and I still get a kick seeing the car in the garage.  It‚Äôs just pretty.  In total I really enjoy the driving experience. Very different than driving my other cars.  Satisfying. 

Cons:  Yes repairs are expensive. I haven‚Äôt had to repair anything major yet but almost anything costs a lot.  Most recent, four new tires were $2500. But tires for any car in this class will cost a lot.  I‚Äôll have brakes next and that will cost‚Ä¶a lot. Find an independent exotic car repair shop instead of the dealer. I called three, asked them to propose an annual maintenance plan, and picked the one I liked the best. 

The car is powerful, but there is an brief annoying lag from standstill.  It is brief, but it still makes me wish it clutched slightly quicker.  But hey, it‚Äôs a Bentley not a Ferrari.  

The batteries are a problem. You will have dead batteries if you aren‚Äôt careful.  The batteries are accessed in the trunk, so I bought the required battery tender, hooked it up, and secured it neatly inside the trunk. Then I hang the plug tail out the back so I don‚Äôt have to open the trunk every time to plug it in.  Every time I come home, I plug the extension in and voila‚Ä¶no more battery discharge issues. Is that ridiculous?  Yes. But owning cars in this class is ridiculous to begin with so this is what we do. 

Interior controls are tedious. No bluetooth connectivity, so you‚Äôre listening to the CD changer or the radio.  You‚Äôre answering your phone on your Bluetooth earpiece instead of through the car. No usable navigation on the 2007 so It‚Äôs google maps on your phone instead. No built in usb ports. I plug a USB adapter into the center port so I can charge my phone. Works fine.  The interior controls are old and clunky.  Very outdated by 2023 standards.  Multiple button pushes to access climate control, for example. Then you have to select the audio function separately to make changes to that.  Then back again. It‚Äôs just old tech. The climate control itself is fine.  It‚Äôs just all the manual button pushes that‚Äôs a hassle.  Do I feel silly complaining that I have too many buttons to push in my Bentley?  Yes.  But you asked.  And I can‚Äôt get my garage doors to sync with the car, so I clip the garage opener onto the visor.   Eh. Fine. Oh also, No backup camera in the 2007.  That‚Äôs the thing that is most irritating. It‚Äôs sure not life changing, but I wish it had a backup camera.  C‚Äôest la vie. 

Overall, I adore this vehicle. As old as it is, I still love driving this car every single time.",Bentley

Also can we talk about how a RR in the 80‚Äôs was like 5-10 times the cost of a Ford or a Toyota?  So this just a ridiculous comparison.  And when you factor in purchase price and average longevity, never mind necessary service intervals and cost of ownership, there is simply no logical case that the RR is a more reliable or economical vehicle to purchase.

If you‚Äôre in the states then it is illegal for the dealership to void a factory warranty if the vehicle was serviced at another registered service center with all work being done in good faith. The challenge is providing documentation in the event of an issue showing the alternative dealership met or exceeded the service that Bentley would have done otherwise Bentley would argue you did not fulfill the required conditions for the warranty to remain valid.,Bentley

"It's still a scam (though quasi legal) registering your car in a state you don't have a residence in.  Most states require your vehicles to be registered in the state you primarily live in.  However, if the emissions issue was serious enough of a problem to a car I want to own, I would do the same thing. 

Avoiding taxes and fees you should be paying is just wrong, particularly for the wealthy that tend to do it with extremely expensive exotic cars.  No state should be allowed to collect sales tax again if it had already been paid for elsewhere for those vehicles.",Bentley

"I should‚Äôve explained the role of banks too, super important.

Banks create money when they lend the money that depositors entrust to them.  If the government invests/spends a dollar into the economy, then someone gets paid that dollar and either all or a portion of it eventually goes into a bank via spending and saving.  A bank can then loan out that same *single* dollar 5-10 times.  As one can imagine, these borrowed funds then make their way into the economy and eventually to other banks, in which case that bank can now create even more money.  Banks don‚Äôt need paper money to make loans; only 3% of money is still old-fashioned currency while the other 97% is just numbers on a screen.

These cars are notorious for the plastic vacuum lines located above the transmission that can break.  My understanding is that the only way to get at to fix them is to take the engine out of the car.

"Labour for a drop is ¬£3.5k plus parts, if they're dropping you'll wanna swap other bits too while the lump is out. My advice is to read the small print on what is covered in the warranty, it might cover mechanical, not rubbers, or might be lump and gearbox but not fuel pumps or water pumps and so on. Unlimited mileage warranty is vague for sure. Ring around other mechs too get price to replace head gasket so you have ball park figure, ask what their process is if they drop or replace in situe, I suspect drop. Anarge engine is proper big. Check out replacement bits on autodoc and try flyingspurs parts too. I would be looking at ¬£4k if the warranty isn't covered. Good look dude.",Bentley

I've driven Bentaygas side by side to my Q7 and SQ7. No they are not even comparable except that they have seats and a wheel. A Bentayga Speed compared to a SQ7 is am insult to the Bentayga. Completely different planets. A prestige Q7 feels like a stripped to the bone Bentayga.,Bentley

Also yes, the Flying Spur was launched in 2004, a couple years after the Continental GT in 2003, and it‚Äôs like the saloon version of the Continental itself. 

On the other hand, the Mulsanne was launched in 2010 to replace the Arnage, and these 2 belonged in the lane of those models that still retained Rolls-Royce/Bentley merger parts from the Vickers ownership era (Mulsanne, Turbo R, Continental R, Azure, Brooklands, etc.).

"I just bought a 2007 CGT with double the mileage for half that price, with about $2-3k in repairs needed after purchase which is why it was at a discounted rate, so I think you may want to keep searching for a better deal for this model. I bought it knowing I would be spending some money on repairs, but it was such a great deal I knew I had some room to spend. At $20k, I am not stressing - if I spent $40k, I would be bummed to own this old of a vehicle, even with less mileage. If you can afford it, I would wait for the newer model you can afford, or try to find a cheaper \~07.  


My research led me to believe 07 onwards were the only worthwhile ones, with the 04-06 having more serious risk and issues that require a full engine drop for too many things like the vacuum lines. Don't take my word for it though as there is mixed info in here on it.   


I did lots of research here + online and concluded that it will be a pain to own at times, but as something on my bucket list, I felt like I would rather just get one I can afford now and spend some on repairs versus waiting a few more years (as I have been putting this purchase off for like 7 years already and just celebrated 10 years of my company and wanted to buy this as a milestone reward.).

"See other comment on this topic. This is a valet area outside the Hotel Kempinski in Riga where you stop your car so the valet can take it to the hotel parking facility. This is down a one car width loop, so one has to stop on the raised area next to the hotel so as to not block the loop whilst the valet takes the car.

In other words, it‚Äôs the hotel‚Äôs land and they will do with it as they please, regardless of how you wish they arranged their valet parking system.

"Big costs are vacuum hoses, camshaft sensors, boost sensors just as a few examples, you have to drop the engine circa 5k in labour plus parts. Just to replace a cheap part. You can get the parts cheap but the labour charge is the labour charge.  Check the roof liner isn't sagging, check that all the bits work like buttons and electrics. You can pick up check modules from breakers cheap. An example TV decoder for dab if you don't have one is 200, easy to fit yourself. Switches and buttons and even control modules are cheap used from eBay. Brakes and exhausts are normal prices nothing exciting there. When it comes to engine parts buy new, but don't always buy Bentley remember some electrical sensors or parts are just glorified VW parts, Bosch parts or continental parts, don't always go with Bentley branded. But don't skimp on cheap parts either. Subject to use keep 2500 a year back for parts. Do a full diagnostic scan with odb to make sure you're not buying a dud.",Bentley

"I have a '13 GT with 52k miles. Have had it since 2017 / 7k miles. I've been meticulous with upkeep.

Brakes and rotors = $5500 labor and parts. 6 week turn time.

Had an engine oil recirculation issue 2 years ago. That was $7k and 6 weeks to fix.

Oil changes and services (annual) are around $2k per. That usually includes the inspection. 

Tires...one goes, you replace all four that's $2000. Can't rotate them. Last about 10000 miles. 

Someone damaged the trunk badge tears ago. $1100 just for the badge. 

Current issue is a slow air leak in front passenger strut. Bentley recommends replacing both fronts at the same time. $6k for one, $10k for both. It's not a bigbissue right now but eventually I will need to address it....probably this year.

I'm guessing I've easily put $35k into maintenance over the last 6 years. Every service is 3+ weeks. I have to have it trucked to the dealer. Easily $200k all in.

"Let‚Äôs look at the top three items comprising just $60b of the $100b and see who is benefitting most from the spending.

$30b for Pentagon equipment: $30b spent by the Federal government on U.S.-made military equipment and personnel.  This means employing Americans to make U.S.-made military products that are then used by other Americans who are employed by the U.S. government to use them in service of supporting the mission.

$14b for Pentagon intelligence: employing Americans to provide a service to an ally nation using U.S.-made equipment.  Again, U.S.-made equipment is made by Americans employed by U.S. companies like Lockheed Martin, RTX, Northrop, et alii, and used by Americans employed by the government, specifically the Pentagon in this example.

$16b for State Dept.: again, employing Americans to provide a service to Ukraine using U.S.-made equipment.

Furthermore, all of this demand/spending created by the Federal government drives up and/or maintains the value of the stock of said U.S. companies as well as thousands of others tied to military industrial complex funding.  I think we can all extrapolate the benefits of a healthy NYSE and Nasdaq.

Last, it‚Äôs so important to remember is that these are not tax dollars being spent‚Äîwe‚Äôre not talking state spending here.  The Federal government creates economy by spending and then checks us via taxation.  The Federal government does not need taxes to spend.  The Federal government is the original spender.

"Lots of speculation in here, not much actual owner experience though. Here's mine, but first some caveats:

\- Mine is a later model Turbo R from 1996, so not strictly 80s, but it's very similar to the original '85 version.

\- Significant difference is that mine has an electronic fuel injection system rather than the Bosch K-Jetronic system (or even the original SU carbs) used in the 80s

\- Mine also has the later 4L80-E transmission instead of the old TH400, though that has no real bearing on reliability other than the engine revving lower at motorway cruising speeds.

\- I also live in the UK, where there seem to be a lot more knowledgeable mechanics to work on these and parts are easier to get hold of.

I've owned the car for just over two and a half years and in that time it has never not started first time, and has never failed to proceed. I spent a lot on it in the first 18 months on deferred maintenance and getting it properly sorted, since then I've been spending a lot less.

Servicing really isn't that big a deal, oil and filter change every year, transmission fluid and filter every three. There's a hydraulics one at some point but it's not that frequent. I drive the car every couple of weeks, it's really important to use these cars. Problems happen when they sit around.

People always love bringing up Hoovie, but his experience really isn't typical. He buys cars for content at the end of the day, and a perfectly good example isn't going to get many clicks. It's interesting to contrast his Turbo R even with a Silver Spirit that Car Wizard had on his channel, he talks a very different tune about the Crewe cars on that one. Matt Farah and Jay Leno's videos show what happens when you have a decent one and look after it.

As for high mileages, these are luxury cars so don't rack up the miles as much as others, but there are people with well over a quarter of a million miles on these without any engine rebuilds etc. The L series V8 is a massive understressed lump, and as long as the oil is changed annually will last and last and last. There's no belts or chains to worry about.

Honestly these cars are just very special, well built from quality materials and are unlike anything else. If they have been neglected they can be troublesome, if not they are bomb proof - which is not unlike a lot of cars really.",Bentley

"> If you're buying a Bentley why would you worry about practicality?

Because a Bentley is supposed to be practical. We're not talking about Lamborghini.

> I felt like the Bentayga cheapened the brand, but I'm not the head of a car company, either. The W12 Flying Spur really represented the brand to me in modern times just because I felt like it embodied the spirit of Bentley more than any other model since the Arnage

The Bentayga saved Bentley. VAG executives threatened Bentley in 2019 if they weren't profitable within two years. Without it the Flying Spur would've embodied the spirit of financial trouble that Bentley's also familiar with. The reality is you can't survive as a modern car company without an SUV. VAG leadership is also ruthless, so Bentley needs to generate profit unless they want to find another suitor. 

I don't like SUVs in general, but I quite like what they've done with the Bentayga. The interior is last gen - more reminiscent of the mkII Continental GT and Flying Spur, but I still think it's beautiful.",Bentley

"$5 to $10 is created in the economy for every $1 that the Federal government spends.  This means that when they spend $60b on said American jobs and products, then another $300b to $600b is created in the U.S. economy.  Whilst one may not care about employing Americans‚Äîalthough the families with those jobs probably do‚Äîthat $60b is multiplying and so much more is being created in the U.S. economy by way of related businesses and then the spending of all of said employed Americans, their families, and so on; this means even more employment and earnings for Americans than were directly tied to the original dollar amount spent by the Federal government.  It‚Äôs easiest to think of Fed spending as investing, rather than spending in the traditional personal sense, since the Fed‚Äôs spending is limited by metrics like inflation, rather than a dollar limit, which doesn‚Äôt exist, except as instituted by politicians.

For an historical example, let‚Äôs think of the economic boom created in the U.S. by WWII.  The country continued to deal with the fallout of the Great Depression until something like $4t or $5t was spent by the Fed (adjusted for inflation).  The majority of which was spent employing Americans to make American products.  This government spending in tandem with government-mandated price controls finally allowed the economy to recover and led to the resurgence of a strong stock market‚Äîthe Dow was up 130% in four years.  Moreover, embracing spending instead of austerity helped keep the cost of living for Americans from rising some 40% less than occurred during WWI.

The U.S. doesn‚Äôt accomplish this type of economic growth by employing foreign workers and paying them in dollars nor by employing Americans in a foreign currency.  There‚Äôs vast historical economic precedent for why ‚ÄòAmerican Made‚Äô receives such a consistent ovation.

Unfortunately, there have been several points in U.S. history when politicians have projected the need for a balanced household budget onto the Federal budget; it‚Äôs frustrating that politicians don‚Äôt have to understand basic economics to be elected.  But by no means does a balanced budget for the average American equate to the Federal government.  People are able to create economy once we have the currency, but we can only do so if sufficient currency is in circulation.  The monetary sovereign (Federal gov) must first spend in order to create economy, which is then controlled via taxation to solve for problems like inflation.  If the government were to ‚Äòbalance its books‚Äô in the household sense by way of reducing the money in circulation (i.e. the economy), then taxes go up, business and personal spending goes down, and the economy recedes and/or depresses.  Without a healthy economy fuelled by the spending of the monetary sovereign, which supports high levels of employment (but never over-employment) wherein people are being paid and spending (=growing economy), then it doesn‚Äôt matter how much is in the right pocket (Fed gov), because the left pocket (Americans) aren‚Äôt getting anything out of it.

That said, rather than pocket to pocket, it‚Äôs likely easier to think of the economy as a sink that we want to keep just perfectly full of water.  The gov turns on spending via the faucet.  If there‚Äôs too much spending flowing into the sink, then we need to open the drain via taxes as to avoid dollars spilling over the top of the sink and loosing value because there‚Äôs so much (i.e. inflation).  With the right amount of water/spending flowing in and out of the sink, due to a balance between incoming and outgoing dollars from the economy, then we‚Äôre maximising the number of people in said economy who have opportunity to benefit as well as increase the amount that they‚Äôre able to benefit, and then feed back into the economy‚Äîthe cycle continues!  :)",Bentley

"Mercedes chiming in.

RR and Bentleys were not made to endure regular consumer beatings.

This leads to the question: what is a better car? A car that can last 500,00 miles and get you to point A and B and C every time with very little maintanence and also cheaply?

Or a hyperluxurious car that can do the same as long as it goes through thorough expensive hyper maintenance and replacement of parts?

After all, a Formula car is engineered amazingly. But it wouldn't last a week on the streets.",Bentley
Money,Bentley
If you‚Äôre buying it at the dealer and it only has one owner with low mileage you can pay to have it certified with the option to extend the CPO warranty additional years given current mileage. Otherwise no warranty.,Bentley
"With Jeep drivers if you see another jeep driver with a rubber duck on or near their dash you both have to face the direction of Toledo, OH USA and do the ‚Äúyip yip yip yip uh-huh, uh-huh‚Äù from the Sesame Street Martians.

"The N20 was hot garbage, and the B48 is not used on any 7 series. They use the B58 i6 or the N63 -> which the latter, is arguably the biggest turd BMW has ever bolted under the hood of their vehicles.

The B series engines have their pros and cons over the N series engines. The cooling system on B series engines is an absolute joke. An insult actually. But they have superior injection system and turbos. Pick your poison. I love them because they keep paying off my mortgage.",Bentley

"Problem with a Bentley is if it's more than 5 years old, it's no longer a status symbol because it is clearly second hand or more.

So if clout is what you want, you can get a newer model MBZ SL for the same price at a quarter of the maintenance, and arguably way more fun to drive.",Bentley
Wow,Bentley

Ah so what you mean is everyone else should be saving the world but you can sit over there and watch. Sorry that isn't how it works.  let me know when you are dropping 50k at the local homeless shelter. till that point STFU,Bentley
"Looks awesome! Do you mind if I ask what the annual running costs are? I figure this is how a Bentley should be maintained, but I‚Äôm guessing it isn‚Äôt cheap!",Bentley
"Mk1 is narrower, I believe. I don‚Äôt think it would work.",Bentley
"Looks fine, nice, even, on the Continental GT imo. hugs the shape of the bootlid and is distinctive.

The problem as with most SUVs is that they're trying to ape the cues of a related coupe or sports car when they've a totally different shape. I think making them extrude out with a hole in the middle is also quite unattractive versus the subtle, flat finish on the GT's taillights",Bentley
It‚Äôs a good job those wheels are not expensive. /s,Bentley

It is certainly the place for me.,Bentley

"A lot of work at that age on a Contintal is engine out service, keep that in mind. They were a piece if shit when new and even worse at high mileage. Basically, it's a VW Phaeton underneath, VW didnt even change the dash layout. There is no such thing as a cheap Bentley. You either spend the money and get a good one or you buy one and spend the money fixing them. I have a 2005 Arnage R built when Rolls Royce was still involved, and it has always been maintained at Bentley. It is incredibly reliable, to be honest.",Bentley
"An E38? I thought you were going to say an E65. Was it a V8 or a V12? The M62 doesn't really give major problems. The horseshoe timing guide is the biggest offender. The rear plate doesn't fail as frequently as the N63, and the upper crossover pipe can be replaced with the engine mounted in the vehicle. It doesn't use the goofy alternator bracket seal like on the N series either. Only the lines that go to the remote mounted oil filter housing. That can be replaced in vehicle as well. M73 V12 ain't much different. Throttle bodies are an expensive failure on those. 

The fuel line you speak of is the evap fuel tank vent line (purge valve) to the engine. Another easy fix. They also have the breather hosing that BMW updated with an improved design, and M62/73's still have the shitty valve stem seals BMW has been using forever.",Bentley
lmfao,Bentley
"Completely agree with you, I‚Äôm not buying a Bentley or any ultra-luxury for practicality. But with the Bentayga, Urus, Cullinan, Aston DBX, Ferrari Purosangue, etc., the market doesn‚Äôt seem to agree with us unfortunately",Bentley

"I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll get a straight answer here with numbers lol. Everyone is here to tell you how stupid this is. 

I‚Äôll tell you though. Expect around 7-8k/year to maintain this vehicle. I‚Äôm saying more on the average here. Some years you might see 2-3k, other years, it can swell to 10k+ for more major fixes. Either way, not that it‚Äôs insanely expensive, but relative to the car‚Äôs value after depreciation, it doesn‚Äôt make sense.",Bentley
I‚Äôve always pulled my tail lamps and had them coated with an automotive clear tinted with black. Light transmission is significantly improved and clearer vs. tint. Cosmetically it looks sooo much better than film as you can also wax/ceramic your lights along with the rest of the car.,Bentley

"And even read me a goodnight storyüò¨370.000‚Ç¨ is quite steep, also considering that they depreciate so much.

So the price didn't bother me, but I personally would never buy one that isn't in perfect condition, at any price. So expensive to fix anything that goes wrong, and there's a lot that could go wrong. So far so good. That being said ,it's my second Bentley and buying this car was one of the best decisions I ever made. Driving this car, owning this car has added a ton of joy to my life.",Bentley
