"That sounds like a faulty battery.

If you replace the battery and it dies within the same day, you probably have the Bluetooth module parasitic draw. Early build are known for this parasitic draw. Disconnect it and go from there. Search on YouTube how to find/unplug

"The sonata head has a bigger combustion chamber than the factory 4g69 head. So you won't gain any power but more then likely lose power.

Not only would you need the head but also adjustable cam gears (because the proper timing belt does not exist so you have to make up the difference with adjustable gears.) and you would. need to flash the ECU with an Evo rom to remove mivec.

"I have a 2006 Lioncel (funny Alibaba edition of Lancer, just ask google what it is)

From my experience it's mostly a reliable car that even with lots of abuse it could still run, and they're really easy to work on if it is like 4G15 or 18. Not familiar with the 4G92/93 ones. 

If your area has snow, check for rust on the frame, lift the car up. If it's bad then it's not really worth the buy.. This generation of lancer/mirage shares the chassis structure with Evolutions but you only can experience that if you rebuild the suspension on a relatively rigid chassis.

Also check the wiring. Mine had the issue of leaking water under the windscreen. it almost ruined the entire car once. Probably not an issue for different countries models, because mine is technically a domestic market car for my country.",mitsubishi

"Personally I would prefer the 04 ralliart over the 09 mainly due to the throttle cable and transmission options. The engine in the 2009 is ""drive by wire"" which means the gas pedal isn't directly connected to the throttle body. This creates a lag between the time you step on the pedal and when the throttle plate actually opens. The 2004 model engine still uses a mechanical connection between the gas pedal and the throttle plate so it's an instantaneous interaction giving you more control over what the engine is doing. 

Also if the 2009 has a CVT that's an instant deal breaker since it's guaranteed to fail sooner than you'd like regardless of any maintenance. Those transmissions are simply not designed to last or perform as well as the alternative options available. 

Another reason I would choose the 2004 is that I've rebuilt that engine before and it is by far the easiest to work on and understand what's going on. It's also way easier to modify and pull more power out of. The only downside is the connecting rods are rather skinny so if you plan on actually building the bottom end, I would recommend different rods if you plan on any forced induction in the future.",mitsubishi

"Ok, ive had every single ‚Äúdoesnt start‚Äù lancer problem in existence and im here to guide you. Im not a lechanic nor an expert but my lancer has had so many starting issues i got the hang of it 

That video is low charge on the battery, which means either the battery is dead pr something is doing parasitic draw. Give it a jump start, see if it starts. If it doesnt start then its a problem with the starting mechanism or a fuse. If it starts then its either battery, alternator or parasitic drain. Buy a new battery or borrow one, see if that solves it first. If not then you have to see if its alternator or drain.

The flow diagram on the wiring panel goes battery -> radio -> hands free system -> then everything else un different circuits. If when you open the switch on your key, lights dont look dim or the cluster looks dim then its the radio or the battery. If they dim, its the alternator possibly. Best way to check is to check the current on your battery with the car with switch open, then measure the current with the car electrics off. (Idk what the device is called but google current checker and you‚Äôll get the idea, also most mechanics have them)

Car electrics On, it should be above 0.9mvs
Car electrics Off it should be below 0.9mvs

If its above 0.9mvs with everything off then its parasitic drain

If it doesnt get above 0.9mvs with everything on, its the alternator

In the 4N14 japanese engine (more common in newer outlanders) the most common issue I've seen is in the balance shaft system which is frequently removed by the owners (cheap to remove, expensive to replace and keep replacing).

Just so it keeps all the warm air in the engine bay out. However I'm not sure they'd be worth whatever these companies are charging for them. One thing that I did with my car that's kind of the best of both a short ram and a cold air intake is taking the factory intake and basically throwing a performance filter in and replacing the stock intake tubing with some rubber or aluminum tubing since a lot of factory pipes have those baffles in them to allow for movement of the pipe, but those baffles also hinder flow and retention of air density. So it does require a bit of self fabrication, but it's way cheaper and sounds just as good as a cold air, at least on my car I won't speak for everyone. After it was all said and done it was about $140ish for the tubing and filter and I also went and cut out all the intake muffling in the air box as well to make it louder.",mitsubishi

"Just to add, servicing the CVT transmissions on these are super easy, basically an oil change without doing a filter change. It has a dipstick, I‚Äôd definitely put it and check the fluid on a clean white tissue or napkin. If it‚Äôs clear then great, if it‚Äôs a darker or muddy brown then absolutely get the fluid flushed/ replaced if you buy it. If it‚Äôs black then your best bet is to walk away- you can still have it changed with fresh fluid and it may last you a very long time, but it just as easily may fail 20,000 kms down the road, it all depends on how much wear has gone on inside.

This is the correct answer,mitsubishi
"Do not change, everything you‚Äôve heard about not touching a transmission fluid is true, specially in a cvt transmission and the reason is: 

If you‚Äôre not sure if the previous owner ever changed it then don‚Äôt do it. If you‚Äôre already over 160k miles and the car has no issues or the transmission is working good without making any weird sound then just leave it as is. As soon as you change the old fluid, the new cleaning additives in new fluid will clean (yes) every dirt and debris inside of the transmission and problems are going to start to show up. LEAVE IT AS IS, it will last whatever is supposed to last, which on a cvt transmission is uncertain but just use the logic. 

I had the same question when I purchased mine with 120k miles from the original owner and he never changed the fluid so, I ask many different mechanics and they all agreed that I shouldn‚Äôt do it. So I never did and my car still runs fine with 150 miles and is my daily.",mitsubishi

"Hard to tell if it's worth it when you didn't list the price.  Also, who rebuilt the transmission?",mitsubishi

I've had two parts issues I can remember from them. I ordered control arms and got two for the same side, then another time I got exhaust gaskets that were bent in the middle.

Not sure how much these 10th Gen lancer ECU's like to adjust by themselves, but from what a college classmate of mine has told me, they absolutely hate modifications.

"First, have you ever had the fluid replaced?  Before going off the deep end about this, I would suggest doing that, because:

[P1740 is a torque converter solenoid issue](https://mitsubishitechinfo.com/data/GS41/2009/23/HTML/M123120900015500USA.htm), which falls outside of the typical CVT failure issues we hear about on here.  The torque converter shares fluid with the rest of the transmission, the ‚Äúlockup‚Äù solenoid is what directs fluid to the ‚Äúlockup clutch‚Äù so that it will engage. This lockup clutch is typically only engaged at highway speeds, or when you‚Äôre driving gently.  It saves fuel by essentially locking the torque converter so it spins at the same RPM as the engine without any slippage.  The TCU is programmed to engage this when there is no demand for acceleration (i.e. constant speed in the highest gear without sudden rates of change in your accelerator pedal position).

"Just engine swapped mine with the 4G94 from a lancer after the 4G15 that was in it over heated one too many times and blew the head gasket after 200,000 miles of neglect and abuse. It's almost funny how easy it is to fix these things tho and there're tons of great upgrades you can get from other Mitsu cars like bigger brakes and whatnot. 

I got mine from a shady ""buy here pay here"" lot for $600 back in 2016 and when I got home and popped off the wheel covers, I noticed 3 wheels only had 2 of the 4 lug nuts/studs holding them on haha -.- The previous owner was an apparent crackhead so I had to remove the interior due to the stains, which is how I found their crack pipe under the dash. 

The driver door doesn't lock anymore and the rear doors only open from the inside somehow. The clear coat is 80% gone and looks a bit like a reptile shedding its skin. The hood delaminated from the bracing so it folds in half where the prop holds it up at, pretty sure this is a common problem. 

I replaced all the bushings, installed $200 Chinese coilovers to lower it, converted to rear disc brakes, and added 2"" wheel spacers >.< so it drives like a go kart now. One of the best parts is that it only weighs about 2000 lbs which helps it get around 30 mpg and it stops better than most other vehicles on the road. It's a decent commuter car that's easy to drive and see out of and lives up to its sub compact size class. I can crank down all the windows from the driver seat. 

I never planned to daily drive mine but I have been for the past 6 years now and it's kind of grown on me. I find it kind of funny but also love the fact that it has pretty much the same chassis as the Evo V and a lot of the body is mostly interchangeable. 

It's definitely a polarizing car for some reason tho, most people love it but an oddly large number of pickup truck drivers really hate it and often try to blast me with soot or try to race me during rush hour at every traffic light.",mitsubishi

I can't think of any moving mechanisms that manage the sound of the engine in this car.

Also, never a good idea to run out of fuel completely - will suck up any contaminants at the bottom of the tank, put more pressure on the fuel pump, more chances of pump overheating and failing etc. If in that scenario, you'd rather use up the battery range first and then go on ICE in normal instead of running out of fuel in the charge mode.

"It's a simple fix if you are a little bit hands on with mechanical stuff. There's a digitizer in the front of the screen that you touch and it translates the touch to the radio. That part is about 30 bucks on Amazon and you need to take the radio out and open it to replace it. I own a 2020 outlander sport and just did mine 5 days ago. Took me 2 hours and well worth spending those 2 hours and 30 bucks than paying so much more to replace it. I will attach links of the product I bought and YouTube videos I used to help guide me through the process. All you need is a phillips screwdriver, a heat gun and some paper cutting blades to separate the digitizer from the radio and slap the new one on using some double sided tape. 

Here's the link for the product I used: Dasbecan 8"" Touch Screen with 2... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCCJ9BYC?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share.

You can switch to a ralliart or evo basket, but you need to do some funny stuff to make the level sensor work correctly.

I believe the drain plug is either a 17 or 19mm. There‚Äôs a drain plug on the transmission pan. I drain mine into a container I can easily measure with. See how much comes out, put that much new fluid back in, stick a funnel in the dipstick hole and fill how much you took out. Start it, go through the gears for a few seconds each gear then back in park (P R N D L) while it‚Äôs running check the level. Drive it for 10-15 minutes to get the fluid warm and check again, when it‚Äôs warmed up it should be at the top of the hot mark. Side note, after filling through the dipstick hole wait a few minutes before checking. Residual fluid that hasn‚Äôt dripped all the way down will make it hard to see where the fluid level actually is. There‚Äôs also 2 filters if you want to do those. I typically do them every few changes. The first is in your transmission pan. There‚Äôs a second in the cooler/warmer block on the side of the transmission.",mitsubishi

Literally the only wiring I had to do was for the crank sensor plug, wires are the same but the shape is different. Just make sure you have the entire engine with all the accessories and the engine side mount so you don't need to make new brackets. Oh and you'll need to drill and tap the intake manifold for the MAP sensor and IAT sensor which is easy enough. 

The trick to making this swap work so seamlessly is changing out the cam sensor housing on the 4G93/94 head for the distributor from the 1.5L 4G15 which just bolts in place. Then you need to buy spark plug wires for the previous generation Mirage and they'll reach just fine.

Shells are really only good for people with a wrecked car or have tons of left over parts from a build to revive the shell. If you have to buy all the missing pieces it will end up costing more than just buying one.

Second issue is really an Apple CarPlay thing: if you‚Äôre listening to a non-iPhone audio source, certain CarPlay functions like sending a text via voice command won‚Äôt restart the audio.

"I've been wondering about this as well I'm thinking of doing mine to do it and see what happens. Just drain anf ill with the cvt trans oil mistubishi has its expensive but so is risking not using it. The dealer says at 120,000 miles or 193121.28kilometers you should do a cvt transmission change. Dealer wants 450 to do it. Idk about the cvt coolant filter and the filter that's inside the transmission that really needing to be changed because they don't necessarily get clogged or gunned up like an oil filter or air filter does from my knowledge as long as they don't dry out such as being exposed to heats above 100 degrees frequently or low fluid they're fine and if there's no shredded material lodged In them, but if there was you should be getting a very sluggish ride and it should be warning you with either slow down or other pretty lights. My lancer is a 2016 es model runs great but I think due mostly to traffic in my area over the years it hates 2nd gear but every other gear is fine. The dealer won't change my fluid until 120,000 or 193121 kilometers but I feel I should because my lancer also didn't come factory with the suspension i have or a sway bar for my struts and be driven the way I drive mine ü§£ maybe slightly intentional but there's not sport mode for the car or overdrive  but my lancer is always in track/sport mode every time it says welcome when I turn it on..anyways I'm doing mine once I get the fluid simple drain and fill..then when I reach 120,000 or 193121 kilometers I might take it to the dealership to get the filters changed but for now I'm going to do it myself and see if it helps because she needs something. Definitely leave and update after I do",mitsubishi

Every 50k kms change the following:
1) CVT fluid 4.2 quarts (Mitsubishi J4 CVT fluid only!!!!)
2)Trans Cooler filter 
3)Trans Pan filter. 

This is all the maintenance the CVT needs. Do not skip this. It's essential.",mitsubishi

"Haven‚Äôt checked, at work I‚Äôm gonna go home and try putting a CD in maybe and unplugging the battery",mitsubishi

As far as direct injection, Mitsubishi was the first manufacturer to mass produce the tech back in 1996 for the Japanese market. It would not surprise me if Hyundai licensed the GDI tech from Mitsubishi.

When Mitsubishi did bring it to the US, they added another 4 injectors to prevent build up and low speed performance.",mitsubishi
