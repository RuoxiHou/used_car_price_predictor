"That sounds like a faulty battery.

If you replace the battery and it dies within the same day, you probably have the Bluetooth module parasitic draw. Early build are known for this parasitic draw. Disconnect it and go from there. Search on YouTube how to find/unplug

I’d go from there. If your car isn’t holding a charge after all that, probably your alternator. But I’m confident with the first two points I wrote.",mitsubishi

North NJ (5 minutes from GWB) evo x owner here. Insurance for these cars is a bit crazy around us for our age. I’m 26 and pay 500 a month for my evo and Honda fit. Not the cleanest driving record so that doesn’t help. Shop around and you’ll find something cheaper hopefully,mitsubishi
Mine is 2009 dealership refuses to help with anything unless it’s a recall but all of that had been taken care of already.

"The sonata head has a bigger combustion chamber than the factory 4g69 head. So you won't gain any power but more then likely lose power. 

The 4g69 makes 161hp  
The G4JS makes 149hp 

The 4g69 has mivec 
The G4JS doesn't 

Not only would you need the head but also adjustable cam gears (because the proper timing belt does not exist so you have to make up the difference with adjustable gears.) and you would. need to flash the ECU with an Evo rom to remove mivec.

"My local dealership is $86-90 for 5qts full synthetic, new filter, and new drain plug crush washer, so that seems plausible.

I like getting it done at the dealership because they inspect the tires, brakes, and all the hoses/lines for wear and tear. They also checked the engine filter for me (It was clean) at my request.  
It's also nice having a good relationship with the service manager and the dealership when warranty work is needed. I had an interior trim piece come defective, and the owner of the dealership helped expedite the part getting replaced (all for free under the warranty ofc).",mitsubishi

"I have a 2006 Lioncel (funny Alibaba edition of Lancer, just ask google what it is)

From my experience it's mostly a reliable car that even with lots of abuse it could still run, and they're really easy to work on if it is like 4G15 or 18. Not familiar with the 4G92/93 ones. 

If your area has snow, check for rust on the frame, lift the car up. If it's bad then it's not really worth the buy.. This generation of lancer/mirage shares the chassis structure with Evolutions but you only can experience that if you rebuild the suspension on a relatively rigid chassis.

Also check the wiring. Mine had the issue of leaking water under the windscreen. it almost ruined the entire car once. Probably not an issue for different countries models, because mine is technically a domestic market car for my country.",mitsubishi

"Personally I would prefer the 04 ralliart over the 09 mainly due to the throttle cable and transmission options. The engine in the 2009 is ""drive by wire"" which means the gas pedal isn't directly connected to the throttle body. This creates a lag between the time you step on the pedal and when the throttle plate actually opens. The 2004 model engine still uses a mechanical connection between the gas pedal and the throttle plate so it's an instantaneous interaction giving you more control over what the engine is doing. 

Also if the 2009 has a CVT that's an instant deal breaker since it's guaranteed to fail sooner than you'd like regardless of any maintenance. Those transmissions are simply not designed to last or perform as well as the alternative options available. 

Another reason I would choose the 2004 is that I've rebuilt that engine before and it is by far the easiest to work on and understand what's going on. It's also way easier to modify and pull more power out of. The only downside is the connecting rods are rather skinny so if you plan on actually building the bottom end, I would recommend different rods if you plan on any forced induction in the future.",mitsubishi

You should immediately change the fluid, and then, in my honest opinion, change the fluid again in 5000 miles. 

I would actually YouTube how to do it yourself and handle the job yourself to keep the cost down, because changing the fluid is absolutely something I would do every 30,000 to 40,000 miles regardless of how I drove it",mitsubishi

"Ok, ive had every single “doesnt start” lancer problem in existence and im here to guide you. Im not a lechanic nor an expert but my lancer has had so many starting issues i got the hang of it 

That video is low charge on the battery, which means either the battery is dead pr something is doing parasitic draw. Give it a jump start, see if it starts. If it doesnt start then its a problem with the starting mechanism or a fuse. If it starts then its either battery, alternator or parasitic drain. Buy a new battery or borrow one, see if that solves it first. If not then you have to see if its alternator or drain.

The flow diagram on the wiring panel goes battery -> radio -> hands free system -> then everything else un different circuits. If when you open the switch on your key, lights dont look dim or the cluster looks dim then its the radio or the battery. If they dim, its the alternator possibly. Best way to check is to check the current on your battery with the car with switch open, then measure the current with the car electrics off. (Idk what the device is called but google current checker and you’ll get the idea, also most mechanics have them)

Car electrics On, it should be above 0.9mvs
Car electrics Off it should be below 0.9mvs

If its above 0.9mvs with everything off then its parasitic drain

If it doesnt get above 0.9mvs with everything on, its the alternator

If it is the one with diesel (non CVT) I think in 2009 you can find a VW or PSA diesel engine. Diesel engines last a lot but they need more maintenance / fixes from time to time.

In the 4N14 japanese engine (more common in newer outlanders) the most common issue I've seen is in the balance shaft system which is frequently removed by the owners (cheap to remove, expensive to replace and keep replacing).

"Well I think green filter or K&N are pretty good panel filters, if you want to go the cold air route I'd say anything enclosed, so it comes with a box. Just so it keeps all the warm air in the engine bay out. However I'm not sure they'd be worth whatever these companies are charging for them. One thing that I did with my car that's kind of the best of both a short ram and a cold air intake is taking the factory intake and basically throwing a performance filter in and replacing the stock intake tubing with some rubber or aluminum tubing since a lot of factory pipes have those baffles in them to allow for movement of the pipe, but those baffles also hinder flow and retention of air density. So it does require a bit of self fabrication, but it's way cheaper and sounds just as good as a cold air, at least on my car I won't speak for everyone. After it was all said and done it was about $140ish for the tubing and filter and I also went and cut out all the intake muffling in the air box as well to make it louder.",mitsubishi

"Just to add, servicing the CVT transmissions on these are super easy, basically an oil change without doing a filter change. It has a dipstick, I’d definitely put it and check the fluid on a clean white tissue or napkin. If it’s clear then great, if it’s a darker or muddy brown then absolutely get the fluid flushed/ replaced if you buy it. If it’s black then your best bet is to walk away- you can still have it changed with fresh fluid and it may last you a very long time, but it just as easily may fail 20,000 kms down the road, it all depends on how much wear has gone on inside.

These transmissions are very long lasting (hence Mitsubishi’s 10 year, 160,000 km power train warranty) but a good chunk of the reason for that is due to their ease of servicing.",mitsubishi

"With it bouncing at idle, personally, I would say that it's something else.  When a fuel pump starts to fail, it usually works fine until it gets warm and then it will simply shut off.  

With these cars, however, it is well known that the fuel relays are sketchy at best.  But, a relay is just an on/off switch, and in my experience would not do this.  

When and how did this issue pop up?  Were you just driving and it happened, or did you happen to do anything under the hood?  Also, if you made a WOT pull with it, it could have blown off the FPR hose which creates a vacuum leak and will make it idle weird.",mitsubishi

Also, sometimes you can find the same part on other sites for a similar or cheaper price, especially when factoring in shipping costs.

"Nope, was a family members car from the start. I got into an accident and it was a hit and run so they are helping me out lol. Very fortunate and thankful 🥲 The major issues it has/had was a flat tire (already got new ones), parasitic battery (replaced the battery and it probably was the Bluetooth module failing which is a 1/5 problem with these), and needs new outer tie rods which I’ll get too soon on my own since I’m excited for this to be a car that I can learn on how to work on a car with :D",mitsubishi

"You can start with the fuel pump relays. Search up the relays on forums, basically, you swap the fuel ones with ones for the headlights. If the problem goes away, it was the relay. Otherwise, you would want to put a gauge on your fuel system to see what the pressure is at idle and under load. OR, if you want to throw parts at it, the fuel pump is under the back seat on the driver's side. It will take a couple of hours if youve never done it before.",mitsubishi

"The ralliart bumper is epic, fitment is amazing, colors are primo, great build 11/10",mitsubishi
"I wouldn’t get either of those for those prices.

Between the two, I would definitely get the V6, as it has your normal transmission vs the CVT in the 4 cylinder.

CVT takes more maintenance, so you need to make sure it’s been properly serviced. They are will fail if they haven’t been taken care of properly.",mitsubishi
The fuel economy isn’t as bad as I thought it was. Mitsubishi advertises 16mpg for city driving but I’ve been getting 21-23mpg just cruising around town. If you push it tho it drops to 7-10 mpg. If it is as reliable as everyone says it is it would definitely be a great buy,mitsubishi

This is the correct answer,mitsubishi
"Do not change, everything you’ve heard about not touching a transmission fluid is true, specially in a cvt transmission and the reason is: 

If you’re not sure if the previous owner ever changed it then don’t do it. If you’re already over 160k miles and the car has no issues or the transmission is working good without making any weird sound then just leave it as is. As soon as you change the old fluid, the new cleaning additives in new fluid will clean (yes) every dirt and debris inside of the transmission and problems are going to start to show up. LEAVE IT AS IS, it will last whatever is supposed to last, which on a cvt transmission is uncertain but just use the logic. 

I had the same question when I purchased mine with 120k miles from the original owner and he never changed the fluid so, I ask many different mechanics and they all agreed that I shouldn’t do it. So I never did and my car still runs fine with 150 miles and is my daily.",mitsubishi
Got that same problem in my 2015 evo hahaha,mitsubishi
"Hard to tell if it's worth it when you didn't list the price.  Also, who rebuilt the transmission?",mitsubishi
"Yeah, the shipping cost can make it not worth it. I have a 98 Montero though, which is relatively uncommon, so rockauto is often the only reasonable place I can order from. I've had two parts issues I can remember from them. I ordered control arms and got two for the same side, then another time I got exhaust gaskets that were bent in the middle. Both times they sent me replacement parts and told me to keep the old parts with no hassle. That right there was enough to make me a repeat customer, as if the free magnets weren't already enough to bring me back",mitsubishi
"Motul High Torque DCTF can be used in place of Diaqueen SSTF-I.


I was told that by the dealer, they also told me that using it would not void the transmission warranty on my 15 MR. They use it themselves in all the sst fluid changes they do.


I've had no issues with it and my 09 ralli has 240k km on it now and the trans has no issues nor has it had any before. Been using the motul for about 70k km now",mitsubishi
"Hnr springs

I’ve only just finished the front haven’t been on the highway yet. Still needs cam bolts 

I had only the back installed and I liked it better I think

Mine is manual so I think that’s why the front is so much higher.

I haven’t had it above 50 mph yet but I do want to add bigger sway bars now.

"The ""guessdometer"" as we call it in my local Outlander groups is never a good indicator for the actual range as it's entirely based on the last drive.

My 2016 SEL cvt  was at 120,000kms I decided to do a fluid swap,didn't want to go to Mitsubishi cause their fluid was way more expensive so I bought the amsoil cvt fluid cause it was cvtf-j4 compliant and now the car is at 250,000kms and no issues so far And honestly I have not been the nicest to my car it has been up and down mountain logging roads more times than I can count",mitsubishi

Engine wise they are really solid but the cvt is the weak spot you have to maintain it to get to 200+k miles so see the maintenance history it has to have an oil change every 30k miles give or take a few k miles with two filters ( the paper filter is easily accessible so at least the paper filter) but overall really reliable car.,mitsubishi

"Well one thing you could do without a tune is make it run lean (i.e. adding on real cold air intake or swapping to like a performance air filter) so the ECM starts adding more fuel, that will cause some crackle and pops on deceleration, or if that ECM doesn't like that, then go get a dyno tune. Not sure how much these 10th Gen lancer ECU's like to adjust by themselves, but from what a college classmate of mine has told me, they absolutely hate modifications. So just be aware, unlike the older lancers you probably won't make any gains or run correctly at all without an ECU unlock or going standalone.",mitsubishi

My third gen begs to differ.,mitsubishi
"First, have you ever had the fluid replaced?  Before going off the deep end about this, I would suggest doing that, because:

[P1740 is a torque converter solenoid issue](https://mitsubishitechinfo.com/data/GS41/2009/23/HTML/M123120900015500USA.htm), which falls outside of the typical CVT failure issues we hear about on here.  The torque converter shares fluid with the rest of the transmission, the “lockup” solenoid is what directs fluid to the “lockup clutch” so that it will engage. This lockup clutch is typically only engaged at highway speeds, or when you’re driving gently.  It saves fuel by essentially locking the torque converter so it spins at the same RPM as the engine without any slippage.  The TCU is programmed to engage this when there is no demand for acceleration (i.e. constant speed in the highest gear without sudden rates of change in your accelerator pedal position). 

You mentioned that it was running “rough”. How does it perform when accelerating from a stop and on an incline? Does it whine?",mitsubishi
"The gsr, its manual",mitsubishi

"The button might've been dislocated. To fix it you need to unscrew the screw that holds the door handle. It's on the side of the door when its open. Careful so you don't lose the screw into the door. I did that...
Once that is unscrewed you can dismantle the door handle and put the button behind the rubber protection bit",mitsubishi
"Yeah, it really is that easy. People overthink transmissions because it's a ""pretty big deal,"" but if it was already on its way out, then a simple fluid drain and fill ain't gonna fix or stop it from its own devices. Think about it like this: You're gonna drop about 3qts of dirtyish fluid and put in 3qts of clean fluid. Your tranny seriously doesn't even understand what has happened, just that the fluid in there has less grit.",mitsubishi
That ralliart shift boot is mean. Where’d you find one? I might have to put one on my Evo 2 if I could find one,mitsubishi
Did a quick lookup of headunit installs for your year model Outlander Sport and it doesn’t seem too difficult. Are you trying to replace it with the same OEM radio or going aftermarket?,mitsubishi

I’ve owned one should be pic of it somewhere on my posts. I’m talking more often than not. I’m sure you can but the average market for these isn’t 10k. And most people aren’t willing to pay 10k for one because with just 8k-10k more you can get a VR4. The mileage and paint is nice on this one but I don’t think I’m paying more than 8k. This also has the least desirable front end imo early years or later years are the most valuable and recognizable,mitsubishi

"Just engine swapped mine with the 4G94 from a lancer after the 4G15 that was in it over heated one too many times and blew the head gasket after 200,000 miles of neglect and abuse. It's almost funny how easy it is to fix these things tho and there're tons of great upgrades you can get from other Mitsu cars like bigger brakes and whatnot. 

I got mine from a shady ""buy here pay here"" lot for $600 back in 2016 and when I got home and popped off the wheel covers, I noticed 3 wheels only had 2 of the 4 lug nuts/studs holding them on haha -.- The previous owner was an apparent crackhead so I had to remove the interior due to the stains, which is how I found their crack pipe under the dash. 

The driver door doesn't lock anymore and the rear doors only open from the inside somehow. The clear coat is 80% gone and looks a bit like a reptile shedding its skin. The hood delaminated from the bracing so it folds in half where the prop holds it up at, pretty sure this is a common problem. 

I replaced all the bushings, installed $200 Chinese coilovers to lower it, converted to rear disc brakes, and added 2"" wheel spacers >.< so it drives like a go kart now. One of the best parts is that it only weighs about 2000 lbs which helps it get around 30 mpg and it stops better than most other vehicles on the road. It's a decent commuter car that's easy to drive and see out of and lives up to its sub compact size class. I can crank down all the windows from the driver seat. 

I never planned to daily drive mine but I have been for the past 6 years now and it's kind of grown on me. I find it kind of funny but also love the fact that it has pretty much the same chassis as the Evo V and a lot of the body is mostly interchangeable. 

It's definitely a polarizing car for some reason tho, most people love it but an oddly large number of pickup truck drivers really hate it and often try to blast me with soot or try to race me during rush hour at every traffic light.",mitsubishi
Does fluid swap mean you had to do a flush and stuff or like just drained and put amsoil in? I’m not looking for the cheapest option but dealership quoted me $400 just for the change lol bit ridiculous if I say so.,mitsubishi

Where do you live? In Australia you wouldn't get an oil change under $150.,mitsubishi

"If you're saying it's not just the engine revving harder in charge mode, and it sounds louder even at low revs, start by atleast checking all the basics. Enough oil /other fluids, no visible leaks in the exhaust, read for any codes with an obd scanner and go from there. 

I can't think of any moving mechanisms that manage the sound of the engine in this car.

Also, never a good idea to run out of fuel completely - will suck up any contaminants at the bottom of the tank, put more pressure on the fuel pump, more chances of pump overheating and failing etc. If in that scenario, you'd rather use up the battery range first and then go on ICE in normal instead of running out of fuel in the charge mode. Ideally, you want to refuel before the gas level before it gets below 25%.",mitsubishi
"Ask the owner, needs to be a good tuner who knows how to tune with the sst to",mitsubishi
I cannot help with the intermittent folding but the tilting is explainable. It will only tilt one mirror at a time (driver or passenger). It is user selectable by using the side mirror adjustment selector on your driver door. Press the left mirror adjustment button to tilt the driver mirror in reverse. Press the right mirror adjustment button to tilt the passenger mirror in reverse. This is all in your owners manual BTW.,mitsubishi

I also use the site to compare part fitment for different vehicle models since I have 5 different Mitsubishis and they all have a lot of similar if not shared parts and mounting locations. Some of the pictures are super nice as well, like the long blocks and cylinder heads. Even if they don't have it in stock (long block makes sense) you can use the picture as a good reference for what parts are where and what they should look like. Sometimes they'll even give you a drawing with dimensions. And it's really nice when they list the thread pitch and size of different sensors and bolts.

Mitsubishi fit and finish is excellent, no gaps anywhere, tight panel fit. the engineering of mechanical components is solid and minimal amount of what I consider cost savings engineering. the car still has dipsticks to check oil levels. Oil changes are very easy to do yourself, dont even have to lift the car to remove the filter. I use the car for surfing and windsurfing, the interior is easy to clean, thanks to hard plastic and tight gaps. since 2008 the car had One repair, the CVT. even my honda and toyotas had more visits to the shop and honda also spilled its automatic transmission (at 190k). what dont you like about Mitsubishi?",mitsubishi
"The second option is much easier and involves less work as you only have to use a screw to make contact with the installed antenna and the base sticks to the car, meaning you don't have to touch the roof lining.

"It's a simple fix if you are a little bit hands on with mechanical stuff. There's a digitizer in the front of the screen that you touch and it translates the touch to the radio.

Took me 2 hours and well worth spending those 2 hours and 30 bucks than paying so much more to replace it. I will attach links of the product I bought and YouTube videos I used to help guide me through the process. All you need is a phillips screwdriver, a heat gun and some paper cutting blades to separate the digitizer from the radio and slap the new one on using some double sided tape.

"Yea you can. And it isn't as hard as most people think. The engine mounts fit direct. The starter mount on the motor needs to be machined slightly because lancer flywheels are smaller than evo ones. You'll also need to make a fuel return line and modify your fuel basket to accept it. You can switch to a ralliart or evo basket, but you need to do some funny stuff to make the level sensor work correctly. The injectors are also different but you can modify your stock harness to work with them. Yes it's expensive, yes there are better and cheaper ways of making power, no that's not why you shouldn't try something.

In reference to the Evo conversion (the one in your pfp?) how much was your overall conversion cost? 

I’ve seen rolling chassis/shells on FB marketplace for a 8 with the usual rust and whatever else that’s expected out of an older CT chassis for under 10k and have always wondered if a lancer to Evo conversion would ever really be worth it from a value perspective, does your insurance have a agreed upon value that suppresses a standard lancer/oz? ",mitsubishi

"Just make sure it’s CVT J4 fluid. I typically just do a drain and fill every 20k. It’s as simple as an oil change if you’re comfortable doing that. I believe the drain plug is either a 17 or 19mm. There’s a drain plug on the transmission pan. I drain mine into a container I can easily measure with. See how much comes out, put that much new fluid back in, stick a funnel in the dipstick hole and fill how much you took out. Start it, go through the gears for a few seconds each gear then back in park (P R N D L) while it’s running check the level. Drive it for 10-15 minutes to get the fluid warm and check again, when it’s warmed up it should be at the top of the hot mark. Side note, after filling through the dipstick hole wait a few minutes before checking. Residual fluid that hasn’t dripped all the way down will make it hard to see where the fluid level actually is. There’s also 2 filters if you want to do those. I typically do them every few changes. The first is in your transmission pan. There’s a second in the cooler/warmer block on the side of the transmission.",mitsubishi

"I just 4G94 swapped my '99 1.5L manual Mirage last month! 4G94/93 swap is the closest thing to plug n play engine swap you can find. Literally the only wiring I had to do was for the crank sensor plug, wires are the same but the shape is different. Just make sure you have the entire engine with all the accessories and the engine side mount so you don't need to make new brackets. Oh and you'll need to drill and tap the intake manifold for the MAP sensor and IAT sensor which is easy enough. 

The trick to making this swap work so seamlessly is changing out the cam sensor housing on the 4G93/94 head for the distributor from the 1.5L 4G15 which just bolts in place. Then you need to buy spark plug wires for the previous generation Mirage and they'll reach just fine.

"I've been wondering about this as well I'm thinking of doing mine to do it and see what happens. Just drain anf ill with the cvt trans oil mistubishi has its expensive but so is risking not using it. The dealer says at 120,000 miles or 193121.28kilometers you should do a cvt transmission change. Dealer wants 450 to do it. Idk about the cvt coolant filter and the filter that's inside the transmission that really needing to be changed because they don't necessarily get clogged or gunned up like an oil filter or air filter does from my knowledge as long as they don't dry out such as being exposed to heats above 100 degrees frequently or low fluid they're fine and if there's no shredded material lodged In them, but if there was you should be getting a very sluggish ride and it should be warning you with either slow down or other pretty lights. My lancer is a 2016 es model runs great but I think due mostly to traffic in my area over the years it hates 2nd gear but every other gear is fine. The dealer won't change my fluid until 120,000 or 193121 kilometers but I feel I should because my lancer also didn't come factory with the suspension i have or a sway bar for my struts and be driven the way I drive mine 🤣 maybe slightly intentional but there's not sport mode for the car or overdrive  but my lancer is always in track/sport mode every time it says welcome when I turn it on..anyways I'm doing mine once I get the fluid simple drain and fill..then when I reach 120,000 or 193121 kilometers I might take it to the dealership to get the filters changed but for now I'm going to do it myself and see if it helps because she needs something.

As far as direct injection, Mitsubishi was the first manufacturer to mass produce the tech back in 1996 for the Japanese market. It would not surprise me if Hyundai licensed the GDI tech from Mitsubishi.

When Mitsubishi did bring it to the US, they added another 4 injectors to prevent build up and low speed performance.",mitsubishi

The ECU compares the oxygen at the rear sensor to the front sensor to determine if the cat is working properly. If it's outside the tolerances of what Mitsubishi expects (which it will be with basically any other brand) you will get a CEL.

The new cat won't damage the car, but if the dash light annoys you too much you might be able to disable the sensor with a scan tool (or get Mitsubishi to do it for you at the next service).

"Your car takes 3.25qts. Most places charge based on a 5qt minimum. If you buy your own oil and filter, these quick lubes usually charge $30-40 for labor. So figure $35ish for your own oil and filter, $35 for labor, your at $75. And bonus, if you buy the 5qt jugs, after 2 oil changes, you have enough left over oil where you don't need to buy any for your 3rd oil change.

To do it yourself you need a drain pan, filter wrench, drain plug and gasket, a jack and preferably jack stands, adding to the cost. And the filter on the mirage is in a weird spot, you need to do an s-bend with your arm to get to it.",mitsubishi

"It's really difficult to get a ""pops and bangs"" effect with only mechanical bolt ons. The way to achieve it is by getting the ECU to pull timing and dump extra fuel only on decel. Adding an intake won't do anything towards that end. You would have to mess with what the sensors are reading in order to get the right conditions for late detonation but then it would always run that way and make the car horrendous to drive normally. Best bet is an ECU tune so the car does the pops and bangs *only* on deceleration.

I don’t see someone justifiably paying 10k just because it’s low miles especially if you plan on modifying it because shit is going to break anyway.
