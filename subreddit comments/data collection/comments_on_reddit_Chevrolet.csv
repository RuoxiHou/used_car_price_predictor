"Yeah, though putting the steering wheel on the right side adds a bit of cost",Chevrolet
That makes sense.?.?. My friend 2017 tundra has 300k on original transmission. Not one chevy has ever achieved this. READ THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS.,Chevrolet
"Yes it is, it is a common problem in straight axle trucks as well. It is always narrowed to one or all of those things. Sometimes a little bit of play in everything causes big problems like that.",Chevrolet

"My old 2014 Sierra and my current 2017 do this. I believe the torque converter unlocks every time the DOD changes. Displacement On demand, when it switches from running V8 to V4.",Chevrolet

Lmao your whole response is pathetic. I guess your one of thise asshole drivers.,Chevrolet
Undefined miles/gallon though! Unless you’re talking sweat…,Chevrolet
The GMT800s had a version of this as well. I remember playing with it a bunch on long drives in my dads 07 classic crew cab,Chevrolet
If your state’s lemon laws allow it - you can contact GM customer service and press for a repurchase - cos this is a basic deficiency / manufacturing anomaly and they haven’t been able to fix it yet ….,Chevrolet
There is no physical lock but thank you for the suggestion!!,Chevrolet
Heinz Mustard?,Chevrolet
"Changing out the blend door servos generally requires dismantling most of the dash. When I did on my van it took every bit of about ten hours. Granted, I was taking my time since I had never done it before. But, yes, it is a labor intensive job. Still, $3,000 seems a bit much. Do you know how much their labor rate is?

Edit: found this. Worth checking the fuse. Apparently it vibrates loose.

"I can tell you that I never buy extended warranties on new vehicles ever.... With the exception of my 22 Suburban, I was sitting in finance and when asked if I wanted one, I said you know with all the electronics on this thing I better. Better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it. So far with 20,202 miles on it I have had 2 Fuel Injector failures, first time 3 months into owning it and waited 6 weeks for it to be fixed (Chevy paid the rental car) and then with 19k on it, took them a week to fix it. These new vehicles have problems, I would definitely get an extended warranty if you plan on keeping it. Call GM Customer Care about all of this as well, start the documentation process",Chevrolet

Why did the rear quarter panel design team give up?,Chevrolet
I know nothing about cars but I had a car that would get stuck like that.  I turned the steering wheel back and forth a few times and it would get unstuck.  At least try it,Chevrolet

"I dont think the 74 is as light as the 68 to 72 models which under the skin are basicly 67 to 69 camaros.  

The 74 has much stonger bumpers.  Big leaf springs inside the bumpers to absorb impact to the bumpers. 

You can if its not rusted out fix it up and have a decent running car.  It also shares some  parts with second gen camaros.  

Order a classic industries Nova parts catalog.",Chevrolet

">I am aware that through Onstar they track the location of the vehicle.

They can do this, if they have the app installed. If they do not, only OnStar knows where the vehicle is unless the employer has a  3rd party tracking device. 

>What about anything else... recording audio/video? 

Not unless it's a 3rd party device. 

>What about if my phone is connected to the truck, can they track what happens on my phone as it plays through the truck stereo/etc? 

No. 

>E.g., if I'm scrolling through a social media app on my lunch break, or make a call, while connected to truck audio/app, is any of that visible to the employer?

No.",Chevrolet

"Take a quick sniff, but im guessing its water",Chevrolet
do you have any idea if there is a way around it just so i can drive it to the dealer instead of getting it towed? 😭,Chevrolet
We had a 2021 Traverse LS for several years.  Overall nice family vehicle. Loved how much space it had as we travel frequently and have kids.  Had decent gas mileage.  I really don't have anything bad to say about it other than the transmission in ours occasionally shifted weird which seems to be a common issue.,Chevrolet
"One thing I always do when new parts are involved, check the new parts!

Check the fuel pressure.",Chevrolet
"Most cases you'll find the fuse panel located on the left side of the steering wheel near the bottom of the instrument panel, I'd recommend you look at the owner's manual for the exact location, each fuse is in a numbered slot and the owner's manual will tell which one. That said if you're having trouble with the signal light not working it may require that you replace that module, that's often accessed from under the instrument panel left of the steering wheel and can be a DIY job as well.",Chevrolet

"That's your water pump bro. GM mechanic,  we're seeing a lot of them fail.",Chevrolet
"They really are 🤣 that’s what I had too - one of the seals wore off of the fuel solenoid & made it so any time I needed to fill up my car I’d have to sit there and press the handle down constantly bc the fuel tank wouldn’t let the fumes out so it would tell the pump that the tank was full when it wasn’t. So it would constantly click & stop pumping and I’d have to fight it 😭🤣. Hated that pos car. But yes you can, I have the 1.5L Turbo - so I just use regular unleaded. But still love it. Highway miles now that the engine is broken in I was getting 34 miles to the gallon going 74mph. Heavenly😍. I will say though, the auto stop start can be turned off, but it’s something that you have to turn off every time you drive… it’s a little button in the middle of the dash.

https://preview.redd.it/tzhqvx19ndjc1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c4620a0b33a842ff4e89228e9cc5ed8b560eaf2

It’s the little A with a circular arrow around it next to the hazard button. The auto stop start honestly isn’t too bad though, it doesn’t mess with much, you get used to it pretty fast. This is not what my dash looks like as far as features though this must be a base model 2022 because I have a lot more buttons down below and heated seats too🤣. They also have this real cool thing where if you’re stopped on an incline/hill, the engine runs a higher idle so you can let your foot off of the break and the car will remain in that position, I LOVE that feature. Makes it so much easier to get going after stopping on a hill!!",Chevrolet
How does that prevent it from charging using level 1 charging?  Did the change port have water inside the assembly?,Chevrolet

"Should be closer to $3000 plus the labor.

Why is the back so confusing and busy looking?,Chevrolet
Thanks for replying. Just a quick question… the battery light is not on ? Can it still be the battery issue ?,Chevrolet
"They were only asking $100 for the set, almost entertained them but not my style. Was more interested in what wheels they were but didn’t really think about someone just replacing the cap lol",Chevrolet
"Oil drip is usually dark and thick.  Automatic transmission fluid is red.  Coolant is green or orange and watery.   If the coolant isn't on the ground, check your oil level.  Coolant in the oil is a blown gasket and very serious.",Chevrolet
I liked my Cruze 😢,Chevrolet
">Why do you think having one learned key would prevent me from being able to do what the manual says in the option without two learned keys?

Cause one is learned. The other one isn't. And if it doesn't work, it might erase the one learned key you have that works. That's why I suggested taking it to a dealer.",Chevrolet
I'd reach out to install directly and ask them. And the police. Seriously both for your protection.,Chevrolet
"Yes, I swapped out the filter screen as well. It is normal? That surprises me. This is my 3rd Silverado from the second generation, however they’ve all had different engine codes so I really have no idea",Chevrolet
ok that's good to know. how about the heated steering wheel?,Chevrolet
"I have a 2019 Equinox 2.0T Premier, 50k miles and overall very happy, for the past 5 years I had issues with the sunroof motor which died 3 times and was replaced under warranty. Infotainment system: it will auto call on star assist for no reason, had to “hard reboot” twice at the dealership.
Problems with the sensors of auto stop and AWD, systems works well but I keep getting a notification to service them - mechanic didn’t find the problem.",Chevrolet
Crutchfield will have everything you need mate,Chevrolet
"If it’s a vortec max it could be close to 10k. That being said, I wouldn’t tow that much with a half ton that old. The sticker may say 10k but you won’t have fun getting pushed around. They’re just not made for that kinda weight.",Chevrolet
Lots of condensation in the air,Chevrolet
Go to your local dealer and have them do it. They do it all the time.,Chevrolet
"What oil are u running? I ran Mobil 1 for a couple changes when I bought mine and it was ok, took it to local shop , cuz I didn’t have time to do it myself that time, and idk what they used but I had low pressure within 1500 miles, even throwing codes, so I went to royal purple with a quart of Lucas , and mine runs like a whole different truck, run that all the time, I even tried amsoil and it cost me a buttload, and it was throwing codes after 1500 miles again, went back to royal purple and Lucas and I can go 7500-10k between changes without even worrying, still looks new when checked",Chevrolet
Second that,Chevrolet
That's why you got it for a steal. Previous owner gave up on issue.,Chevrolet
Get used engine,Chevrolet
"Sad to say GM doesn’t make them like they used too.  Just got rid of an equinox that was burning oil like nobody’s business.  Bad piston rings was the cause at 60,000 miles. I did every recommended service at the the right intervals at the Chevy dealer.  I traded that thing on a Toyota as lots of people I know with newer chevys have been having problems.",Chevrolet

"I've owned a 2014 Cruze with the 1.4L engine, the mysterious coolant disappearance is still a mystery, usually acts up during extreme cold scenarios, everything has been checked and nothing unusual. However, there are some known issues that may contribute to it such as water pump failure, the connection of the cooling line to the engine may develop a crack (with this one you will see coolant pudding to your right next to the engine cover), the reservoir may crack at the connection point of either of the two small hoses, this requires a new reservoir. Otherwise I just carry with me GMs 50/50 coolant in the trunk during winter and keep my eyes open",Chevrolet

"The auto-dimming rearview mirror is an optional feature that's included in certain packages, the packages often get changed from model year to model year.

"I dunno, putting all that money into a car like this seems like a questionable investment indeed.  How do you know this is actually a ""new engine""?  Is the new engine actually made by GM/Chevy?  Does it come with a warranty?   Is the new engine a ""long block"": one with the cylinder head/timing chains already installed?  Or, is the new engine a ""short block"", one where the cylinder head/timing chains from the old damaged engine has to be reinstalled on the ""new short block""..   Is the servicing shop an actual Chevy dealer?  So many questions that would have to be answered/confirmed before I would spend that kind of money on this car.

I was close to my mechanic when it happened and drove him around and got it to do it while he was in there because he originally thought I meant a vibration as well. 

Right now he replaced the front ball joints and for the moment that has seemed to work. But I won’t know until I drive it some more. He was thinking springs next? He got me a new gear box as mine was very loose and a new piston arm? And that had stopped it for awhile.

When I opened these up, it was apparent the charcoal bits had left the canister and moved through the entire system, preventing the fuel tank from displacing air when filling up.


Only once everything was disconnected, I blew the lines and charcoal canister out with my compressor, and sucked as many out of the purge solenoid as I could with the shop vac. Make sure to get them all out or you will have to do it all over again!


Once reassembled, this fixed my filling issues at least. I still have the tighten gas cap message, but I haven't smoked it yet to find the leak. It might just be a bad vent solenoid, not sure yet. Good luck!",Chevrolet

"Look on your drivers side door sill. There will be a sticker with payload, GVWR and GAWR. GENERALLY, 1/2 tons are not used for 5th wheels in the USA. You just simply limit out on your rear axle too quickly when you factor in the weight of gear and people in the truck. Also the brakes aren’t up to snuff for most 5th wheel trailers commonly used in the USA. 

Find out your payload, and see if your sticker has a max tongue weight for 5th wheel. Once you know a rough max tongue weight, that will be 10-15% of your max towing weight for a 5th wheel.

The vast majority will experience no issues. But some may have shit break. Or engines completely grenade from a shitty part or bad casting. It happens.

"It's not that salt eats at things, it's that people don't bother to wash it off.

I'm going to run it through the car wash on my way home tonight, then probably again on Thursday or Friday when I need to fuel up.  Thankfully it is all right on my way home so I don't have to go make detours to get it done.

I will say that newer vehicles have sheet metal so much thinner than just a decade prior.  That Sonic was a fucking tank.  It took a deer hit at 40mph in the front left corner.  Bastard rolled it's body down the whole left side of the car.  I got out, pulled the fender out with my hands and drove the car home.

My current vehicle is a 23 Trailblazer.  The sheet metal is shockingly thin, enough so that the blower in the car wash can temporarily deform the metal.  That's one of two things I don't like about it.  The other?  The little 1.2L engine, while enough power to do what I need, can't get up to full operating temperature in the winter until I get to highway speeds.  Even then, there is so little heat being generated under the hood, it doesn't do anything to melt what collects on top.  Driving to work this morning, I had to clear the hood off AFTER my 28mi commute because the snow just stayed packed on.  I almost want to wire up a heating element to the underside.",Chevrolet

"This is the way. To clarify in regards to this comment, LKQ is a parts distributer that mostly sells used engines. They usually come with a 12 mo./ 12k mi. Warranty. Also as this commenter stated, get another quote. Sounds like you might be at a Chevy dealer. They will absolutely squeeze you for every penny they possibly can without batting an eye giving a single fuck whether or not you can afford it. I would try a local private shop. They are typically far more willing to try and find affordable solutions for their customers. As a warranty administrator, I deal with this shit all the time. Not trying to add salt to the wound, but in the future, go Honda or Toyota if you need affordability and longevity. American makes are absolute shit these days and they're engineered to intentionally need an engine or trans before you hit 100k mi",Chevrolet
Yup. Or a Honda,Chevrolet
"I'll add, if your purge solenoid is having issues (stuck open, or passing charcoal bits into intake for combustion) you could have misfires - from the actual charcoal or bad air/fuel ratios. If charcoal is getting in your fuel tank/lines, obviously that could cause a misfire as well.


You can get a cheap Bluetooth OBD2 scanner off Amazon and pair it with the torque app on your phone, and get real-time misfire data for each cylinder on our cars.  This has helped me sort out if what I was feeling in the past was a misfire or other issue.  Sometimes it's helpful to be able to rule some of those other things out.


It's hard to guess what your issue is without being there first hand, but given that you're saying the battery gauge drops out, I would lean toward it being an electrical issue, or a combination of multiple issues happening at the same time.  Blowing out the evap system is free though, and getting that sorted out first might give you more of an idea of what route to take next. Or best case scenario, it might just run better and not need anything else, if that was just causing the engine to bog down.",Chevrolet

"I buy about 3 or 4 cans of [PB Blaster Surface shield](https://www.harborfreight.com/12-oz-surface-shield-rust-protectant-59634.html) and I do the whole frame of my 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis every year. For a truck frame, you should probably buy 5 or 6. 

I sprayed this in October 2022 and it was still a bit slick a year later when  I did it again. It survives the entire winter and near-daily undercarriage washes from the automatic car wash. 

Don't use anything other than oil based products like the one I linked. Rubberized ""undercoating"" products trap in rust and do more harm than good. Oil never harms anything and simply sticks and repels water, and does not get in the way of vehicle service or harm components. Spray it on the whole frame and the entire underbody, and in the wheel wells.

There are other oil products like Fluid Film that people swear by. They'll do the same thing but I personally recommend Surface Shield. A YouTuber did a review on all the oil based undercoatings and concluded that this one by far lasts the longest.",Chevrolet
I don't understand why you are having a problem finding this hose?,Chevrolet
"Yeah I was wondering that since it was making all of those different noises. Sigh, thanks!",Chevrolet
"Let's just put it this way. 

When your car was manufactured and engineered, they used the parts that made your car run as efficient and get the most power as needed for that engine. But as far when you start going aftermarket parts, it will be a suspect part that may need to retrofit back to OEM parts to see if indeed is aftermarket components that may cause whatever problem that appears down the road.  

Our diagnostic process is to determine if it has aftermarket parts or components, that is, if you do end up bringing it to a dealer to diagnose. Using oem parts will help you and us techs to properly diagnose your vehicle. 

In the long run, it will last and keep up with the required maintenance per owners manual schedule.  

Sure, there is all aftermarket parts world that you can put in the vehicle, may work, and without trials of baseline your engine performance on a dyno, it may perform better or underperform than the OEM part. It may over perform and cause knocking or other underlining damage to the vehicle.  This is always the unknown until it becomes a symptom and that check engine comes on for whatever code it sets. 

Honestly, I wouldn't want to put anything else on my personal cars than OEM parts that would affect the engine performance. Everything else, Sure I would use aftermarket  bulbs, cab filter, different tires, etc. 

I may be biased in a way due to working at a dealership for a long time, but I have seen it happen where people put the wrong type of plugs and cause all kinds of weird symptoms related to spark plugs.  

Hope this helps in painting a bigger picture.  Some may other thoughts about what I say or different opinions but just my experiences and education on GM products.",Chevrolet
"It's a common problem on these vehicles. It is usually due to a bad switch in the shifter mechanism.  Dealer will want to replace the whole shifter assembly to the tune of $1500 if not covered under warranty (people have had mixed success getting it warrantied).

I’m just having difficulty finding that specific part at the moment as every website says it doesn’t fit my vehicle. I don’t want to waste money and it ends up being the wrong part.",Chevrolet
I bought Champions awhile back. They any good?,Chevrolet
6 lug heavy halfton chevy or 80's toyota truck.,Chevrolet
"I upgraded my old one that looked similar to your original but for a Silverado, and went to the newer style and it programmed directly to my truck with no issues",Chevrolet
"Well supposedly they had corrected the issue after a certain Manuf date but who knows. Hopefully you are all good then, mine happened within the first 4k miles and was fixed, I thought I was good but then it struck again on a different cylinder. Of course they cant replace all of them at one time so it doesnt happen again because they all didnt fail. They have to replace only the part that failed.",Chevrolet
"Good to know, I ended up replacing the battery and after doing that now when I push the start button, the car acts like it's invisible and does nothing, had to disconnect the battery so that the new battery wouldn't drain!",Chevrolet
"The 2.5L 4cyl on this generation of Equinox was never a flex-fuel vehicle, first hint is that on all GN flex-fuel vehicles is you will see a badge, one being the rear badging saying Flex-Fuel, two, on the door filler itself will say ethanol 85 compatible and also on the fill cap which as you noted is also colored yellow. You can get verification of this through the owner's manual as well. The optional 3.0L V6 was E-85 compatible but not always equipped that way depending on the emissions equipment it was built with.",Chevrolet
"Tire pressure gauge, pen, pencil. ID, parking pass card under the clip. And travel box of tissues in the slot below that. Those are all just guesses. Check the owners manual.",Chevrolet

Drain and refill around every 50k. Chevy cvts aren't that bad compared to Nissan. Ive had several and all made it to end of lease with 100-150k and minimal problems (none trans related).,Chevrolet
"It really does. But Chevrolet Niva assembly line is located in Tolyatti, small city near me",Chevrolet
"I’ve had a 2019 since October 2018. No issues at all. I’ve got 74,000 km on it so it’s not too many but overall satisfied with the car. ",Chevrolet
Just recently we had a 2500 HD ZR2 Bison that was $91k on the lot,Chevrolet
I’ve done plentiful research on EGR valves and have tried to find the part online but it seems like I can’t find one that “fits” it according to other websites I’ve looked on. I know if I were to find one it would be an AC Delco product,Chevrolet
This the OEM one or a 3rd party?,Chevrolet
Still more reliable than anything Ford makes...,Chevrolet
The 10 speed in my 21 Silverado is pretty damn good. 6 speed is fairly decent.,Chevrolet
More reliable than mine,Chevrolet
"The battery was original and just started there. The push button, when pushing it it acted like I was doing nothing and won't start at all as if it doesn't recognize me pushing the button",Chevrolet
Until insurance discovers it,Chevrolet
Do you have cruise control turned on but not set to a speed? It'll do that if so.,Chevrolet
"If your exhaust is steamy that's an indication of a head gasket leak, your coolant could be going out the exhaust.",Chevrolet
Read your owner's manual or go to settings. lol,Chevrolet
"Anything after 60k miles I would definitely check for leaking shocks, oil pan leaks and shot engine mounts. Always get a pre purchase inspection",Chevrolet
Probably more reliable than my cruze,Chevrolet
Doesn’t the Chev dealer have it?,Chevrolet
You have 1.5 or 2.0? I know the 2.0 is discontinued now. I think 2022 or 2023 was last year for it.,Chevrolet
"2500's here start at like, $190k and require a CDL off the lot",Chevrolet
"Better than any Chevrolet model—with the exception of, perhaps, the Corvette.",Chevrolet
"Holy crap. Couldn’t find any videos of a 2nd gen Silverado but found one of a 2011 suburban and dude was literally dropping differentials, unbolting axles, the whole 9 yards, just to get the oil pan out.",Chevrolet
Yeah that one photo i sent you looks like the upper radiator hose with the shape it is.  Not sure what you got for lower,Chevrolet
If it's in a catch can it's fine. I use to get that in my catch can every winter. If you don't the. You got some moisture in that oil and that's not good.,Chevrolet
"2. If all else fails, drain the coolant out completely, get two cans of K&W Block Seal, follow the directions on the can, when dry, fill with proper coolant mixture, and trade it in on another vehicle.",Chevrolet
I have the 1lt FWD model.,Chevrolet
Looks awfully similar to a 2004 Chevrolet Tracker. Over seas may have some odd looking models.,Chevrolet
There were no USDM MY08 Caprices of any sort. r/Holden would be a better place to ask because that’s who made the car.,Chevrolet
"I'm in a different brand pickup and have been considering replacing it with a Silverado because they seem to stand near the top in quality and maybe more importantly service satisfaction. My current brand truck's local service options range from horrendously disorganized to misleading and lazy. The local Chevrolet service departments are 100x better run.

More reliable than the vehicles Chevy makes,Chevrolet
"Pulling radio/infortanment fuse will inhibit all radio operations is one option. Or tape a piece of paper over the screen when practicing. 

Try to learn to operate the vehicle without a vehicle watching the rearview camera. Like, watch both side rearview mirrors and turn your head and shoulders to physically look back when backing up.  

You got this. Just practicing basic checks and understanding what you're doing will make you a better driver. Good luck with it.",Chevrolet
Sounds like you answered your own question.,Chevrolet
The diagram matches but the photo doesnt,Chevrolet
"Looks like an aftermarket wheel with a custom cap for mid 90’s to newer 1/2 or 3/4 ton pickup truck. 
(1/2 Tons used to be 5 lug but went to a 6 lug in the 90s.)",Chevrolet
Cragars,Chevrolet
i just had my differential harness replaced too. they missed the fuse blowing.,Chevrolet
Multiply mileage by three to get an approximation of actual wear due to the amount of time spent idling. Compare that to what you would be willing to pay for a 360-450k one and you’ll have your answer.,Chevrolet
"I have 2 Chevy trucks, a 2003 3500 dually diesel with over 200,000 miles, and a 2017 Silverado 1500 with 60,000 miles. Love them both. I have not put a lot of money except proper service.",Chevrolet
Are you a Chevroket tech?  Do you know where I can get the service tech manuals for my Chevrolet 2023 LT Trailblazer?,Chevrolet
"Best way to do it, do your first start and let it run out. Let the car sit for 5 minutes.  Then start again, you'll have a warm car. That 5 minutes of sitting let's the engine block keep the coolant stay hot rather than cycling through the system.",Chevrolet
"Umm what type of drugs is the mechanic on and why isn’t he sharing? A chevy trax is run by a 1.4l v4 TT engine. A 6.7 powerstroke, cummins and 6.6 l5p duramax all range anywhere from 10-20k brand new depending on where you buy from. Those are giant engines with a lot more going on than a 1.4 TT 4 banger. Your mechanic is trying to fuck you. Get another opinion.",Chevrolet
"I'm sorry you had to experience this, best I can do is pray for wisdom for you",Chevrolet
Still faster than a Mustang.,Chevrolet
">I'm sure it's fuel

How sure?? Collect it in a clear bottle and compare it.",Chevrolet
That’s NOT oil filter life. It’s your engine oil life.,Chevrolet
You can buy a new housing at AutoZone for your remote. And just transfer the guts over. Most cost effective route.,Chevrolet
Went isn't your car faster then the Cyber truck?,Chevrolet
Sounds like it wouldn't be worth attempting to restore.,Chevrolet
There's also not a lot of markup on those vehicles. Waving the dealer fees is probably all you're going to get.,Chevrolet
"2012 was great, I loved that car, BUT those ones had an issue with eating oil so you had to babysit the oil levels or else you’d be in trouble lmao. Otherwise though, adored it, had kayak racks on it and everything. & I had a 2010 hhr before that believe it or not🤣 those cars are MONEY PITS. I got that car used for SUPER cheap off of a family friend bc it was a company vehicle so I got it for $500, drove it for 2 years and by the time I sold it I had put just under $4,000 into it to keep it functioning, sold it for $2800😭😭 I HATED that little car",Chevrolet
"Now that you mention that, it does run rich. At times, it would bog itself down with the throttle pressed down. Any ideas as to why it may do that? Anyways, Thank you for the advice!",Chevrolet
10/10 most reliable vehicle ever made by chev,Chevrolet
Where do I put my golf clubs and kids,Chevrolet
I know the LTs we looked at yesterday did not have the auto dimming mirror. I think only the premium has that standard now. I was not sure if they LTs came with a plug near the current mirror for an easy change or not.,Chevrolet
More than the cars,Chevrolet
Book time for a R&R in a first gen trax Is 12.6 hours . Sounds like they are trying to hose you,Chevrolet
"2 10 minute starts, boy i hate that shit.",Chevrolet
"Thanks, I’ll give it a shot but the OS not working at all I know isn’t going to be fixed by this.",Chevrolet
Can you show me that because the only one I see isn’t safe because I would have to smash my fingers inside of the door just to lock it.,Chevrolet
Why no manual? One of the main selling points of muscle cars is the ability to row gears not play with a flappy paddle.,Chevrolet
">You have to download the manuals nowadays.

No you don't. They still offer the printed booklet. But if OP has even put in a tiny amount of effort, they could have found the manual on the app or found the printed booklet.",Chevrolet
"That’s not true at all, at least where I work. We don’t have higher rates for commercial/fleet unless it’s a medium duty vehicle",Chevrolet
"Actuator as in?  HVAC, door locks?",Chevrolet
Why?,Chevrolet
"Just throwing it out there, we had 2 vehicles that we had remaned motors put in...neither of them were more $5,000. labor included .....definitely get other prices.",Chevrolet
"Great, that’s awesome to hear as my engine had very noticeable tick that it getting worse by the month.",Chevrolet
It's faster than my chevrolegs,Chevrolet
"How did you get so upside down?

Get a used engine from a low mileage wreck. $10k for that engine is criminal.",Chevrolet
Cheers to the Koreans for upgrading the Chevy.,Chevrolet
"Hey honey, do these tires make my truck look fat?",Chevrolet
You most likely need a new shifter assembly. It’s pretty common on GM cars. You should have someone check it out before you just go throwing parts at it.,Chevrolet
I have sent to the dealer that’s where these “fixes” were done,Chevrolet
I updated the primary post. Spoke with the tech on the phone and they were on with GM and there were no codes matching our timestamp. They did replace the throttle body as per their collective thoughts and we'll see if that fixes it.,Chevrolet
"This is normal, also the pressure gauge isn’t always very accurate, so generally as long as it’s not close to 0 or 80 it’s ok.",Chevrolet
"I dunno, but it's still gonna leak oil.",Chevrolet
I wouldn't trust any Chevy product with a chain,Chevrolet
I think you can set a priority device in the Bluetooth settings. If that doesn’t work maybe use a wired connection and turn Bluetooth off on your phones if you will be close,Chevrolet
"Understood, I had a feeling it would be a tough job and the mechanic was very helpful at describing how it would be a long job. Thank you!",Chevrolet
Good to hear. I was changing my oil and the old oil looked fine in the pan. It was just the first time I’d seen anything like that.,Chevrolet
If you're still paying on it shouldn't it have full coverage for something like this?,Chevrolet
"Gotchya, I thought it was those wheel speed sensors.  Thanks for the response !",Chevrolet
"I would get a second opinion to make sure it actually needs a new engine and definitely get a quote from another shop, just checked on LKQ's web site and there are plenty of used engines priced from 1500-2500 depending on mileage.",Chevrolet
"Oh, nice! Is that the 6.6 High Country Denali HD BossBike? With all of the high tech advancements, like the leather seat, kick stand, and being a 12 speed, this  gnarly vehicular device is bound to get you from point A to point B in style! Noice!",Chevrolet
Almost 100k US?! Jesus christ. You can get a GMC denali for around that in the states. Much nicer trucks on the inside.,Chevrolet
