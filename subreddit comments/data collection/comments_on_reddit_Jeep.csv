Easy with regular maintenance.  It‚Äôs the rust that will get you.,Jeep

With or without a friend with a winch?,Jeep
"Damn, I knew I should have asked for more than only 10k for my 2002 TJ in way better shape and no rust last year.",Jeep
The last V8 three wheeler.,Jeep
So that's why the turn outs are so fucked up when I pull over. Makes sense.,Jeep
"Nice, also have a '24 4xe Willys in Earl Grey, absolutely love it",Jeep
My advice is to check marketplace often. eBay prices are way too expensive in my opinion. You just have to jump on them when available if you really want some. I drove about an hour one way to get them the same day they were listed.,Jeep
Start the process and let your grandkids take over :),Jeep
"Probably too early, not enough visits for the same exact thing, plus it's pretty new and tech heavy so....Allowances must be made! You know...To save the planet! LoL. It could just be a software thing, as they seem to have a lot of them with the 4xE. I would say, if they say it's fixed and they offer you a free extended warranty (Mopar only!!) then get it back and beat the crap out of it until you are confident it will do what you want it to do. If it screws up again...Well, there you go.",Jeep
Mail em,Jeep
TJ jeeps are best jeeps,Jeep
I know what I got,Jeep
Yes you‚Äôre fine to drive as far as you need. As you said you won‚Äôt have abs function. I would cover the plug into paper towels and tape a plastic bag around it if there‚Äôs any chance it could get wet. This will avoid possible future corrosion issues,Jeep
"Never put cash down, just burning money",Jeep
"I‚Äôm still driving my ‚Äò98 TJ. Admittedly not daily, but I haven‚Äôt had much major trouble after having to replace the manifold years ago. (And I wanted an excuse to buy Borla anyway.)",Jeep
"Honest question, did you actually ask anyone who owns a jeep? Of course owners of other brands think their vehicles are better. ¬†

I see a lot of people asking Japanese brand buyers/owners whether jeeps are good. Surprised by answer?

Jeeps are great, and follow maintenance schedule, buy extended mopar warranty online cheaply too.",Jeep
"I want to buy Jeep (compass or cherokee)  from auction for about 3-5k USD

2.4 liters

about 50 k miles

delivery and taxes for customs will be about 7-8k usd

It is about car from accidents, where best will be little damage, it can be different but not very hard damages)",Jeep
I've got a 77 for sale if you want lol,Jeep
Something‚Äôs probably keeping the CAN awake. I saw a post yesterday how customers complaint was battery keeps going dead after a few days. Technician found their cell phone mount was up against the eject button on the CD player lol,Jeep
It‚Äôll rot around that 4.0,Jeep
"That frame has been repaired which isn‚Äôt a red flag, but the fact that it‚Äôs still rotted through is a large concern. Specifically picture 12. Look right in front of the repaired section. There‚Äôs a rotted hole in the frame.",Jeep
Hubby got a Mojave gladiator 2yrs ago I got the wrangler unlimited sport this year. Welcome to the Jeep fam.,Jeep
Thank you for the response. I feel silly. But this makes sense. Cheers!,Jeep
"The gear is all good, but just use your discretion mostly. And you're most welcome.",Jeep
You should be able to have it re-built for less than 1/2 of that.,Jeep
If it is still under factory drivetrain warranty make an appointment at the dealer to get it looked at.   You can go to any jeep dealer to get it looked at for warranty work.,Jeep
"Oh wow,  a 2005 with 44k miles!",Jeep
"True. And if the only thing needed is a radio for music, you can always throw in some Bluetooth marine speaker pods as a last resort - nothing important in the head unit doesn‚Äôt have backup buttons below the display anyways",Jeep

Had the same horsepower too right?,Jeep

"I mean this in the absolute nicest way possible but it sounds like you just aren‚Äôt Stellantis‚Äôs target customer for this Jeep. 

I‚Äôve got 25-30 friends with factory 392s and they seem to fall into 2 camps:

1) guys like me who don‚Äôt normally play in this price range but cracked open the piggy bank because it‚Äôs something special 

2) guys who build a new $150-200k 1 ton v8 offroad toy every few years anyway and saw the ‚Äúbargain‚Äù of a factory v8 over a swap",Jeep
A true Jeep wholesome does has is makes.,Jeep
"I had dealer issues when I first got my 4xe. It took them 32 days to fix a sway bar link. I called Jeep and they opened a ticket for me and with some back and forth we were able to find a resolution/restitution that made me happy. I ended up keeping the vehicle and I'm so glad I did. Since then my 4xe has been perfect. I've taken it camping, fishing, wheeling and I even have a couple of official badges of honor now.   


My advice, tell Jeep how disappointed you are and make it compelling. They'll come around but it will take some finesse on your part. Best of luck!",Jeep
"The 4.7l brought the value down?  

Now that I have a JKU, the only thing I miss about my WJ is the 4.7.  I had a ton of people after it because of the motor when I sold it.",Jeep
Burnout button,Jeep
"yes.  VERY unlikely to be AX5 with this history, but it isnt BA10/5 Peugeot POS.  Most likely is AX15 as you've been told.  MY impression of AX15 bellhousing is more bulbous and rounded, but the one pictured looks very ""faceted.""  I can tell by seeing the top though, which isn't pictured.",Jeep
"You have to be able to do repairs yourself. Straight up, that's the only real answer. it will be possible as long as parts are available, and you can turn your own wrench. up until recently my newest vehicle I owned was 16 years old, the rest were 20, 23, 26, and 35 years old. I do most of my own work, and it is the only way I can reasonably keep the cars going as long as I do.",Jeep
Cam sensor,Jeep
"A few people stopped to try to buy it, I just couldn‚Äôt part with it.",Jeep
Slid off lots of trails,Jeep
"Oh, crap! So it broke? That's a new one....I think it would have just worked it's way out and flew off the road somewhere...",Jeep
Real Jeeps have check engine lights on. Everybody knows that‚Ä¶,Jeep
Get some auto trim tools made of plastic. And use them to pry out the panel. It just pops out. No screws.,Jeep
Its almost like our entire economy and society is breaking down and failing because the only thing that matters is the profits of billionaires and they don't want hire at fair wages to produce parts that they could sell but won't because they actually hate workers more than they love money.,Jeep
"I have ordered a few Jeeps.

My 21 Trackhawk took like 12 weeks.

My mom‚Äôs 22 Sahara was 12.

My 24 392 was ordered in January and shows end of April delivery.",Jeep
All fun and games until I looked down and realized I spent a good portion of the day doing this ü§£,Jeep
"It only does that when your seat belt is unbuckled, btw.",Jeep
"So I bought my ‚Äò22 392 new for $72,XXX, looked at updating to the 2024 and its MSRP is $91,XXX.

For an updated dash and power seats. That‚Äôs literally all that has changed.",Jeep
Man I love seeing that difference between them! The 2A looks tiny!,Jeep
I legit don't understand how base model manual windows Jeep wranglers keep creeping up in price. 32k msrp starting? THey would sell millions if they got that down to low 20s... like it should be..,Jeep
I agree. I got mine in 19 for under 50k and had to order it but that was before covid and prices of everything getting wierd. I have had no issues with it other than clutch and a leaky pinion seal on rear but that may very well have been my fault on Tin cup pass. It's a shitty design clutch but it still works. Just feels like nothing there and I no longer trust stellantis to put in a setup that has been used for 100yrs. This is what happens when people try to reinvent the wheel so to speak.,Jeep
Look at them wheels too! Can be saved in the right hands :),Jeep
"You obviously don‚Äôt Jeep

"That‚Äôs the new Chinese made Joop Rangler. MSRP of $69.420.

I want one of these so bad.",Jeep
Do you have a plasma cutter ?,Jeep
"That‚Äôs just not true.  The axel tubes are thicker and it‚Äôs a different frame in some areas.  So right there are very expensive things to change. Yea suspension can be swapped aftermarket but there are a lot of small differences that add up to what makes it what it is.  Go drive 99% of ‚Äúmodified‚Äù jeeps then drive a stock 392 and it‚Äôs not even close.  

I have owned 20 jeeps over the years and my 392 will be number 21.  There is value in an all OEM vehicle with zero issues.",Jeep
10 days is absolutely nothing.  I work from home and frequently go a full week without ever starting my vehicle.  I‚Äôve left vehicles for multiple months with no issues,Jeep
"I‚Äôm looking at Tacomas now, haven‚Äôt had any massive issues with my 2020 but feel like a nightmare is just waiting under the surface",Jeep
Yes I bought the warm winch shortly after buying my jeep new in 1977! I bought a yj in about 2005 2006 and put a smittybuilt 8000 lb on the yj,Jeep
"Old as that jeep is, its balls are already low.",Jeep

"Had to do the pentastar 3.6 oil cooler flip last weekend. Can‚Äôt recommend enough watching like 20 videos - the easiest path is revealed between the different methods. 

Also, cross reference different videos during the process.",Jeep
Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard if you do regular maintenance and don‚Äôt go crazy with the mods and wheeling. Parts are stupid easy to get.,Jeep

"Step 1: wrap Jeep in aluminum foil so the tracking signal can't get out.

Step 2: drive to house party.

Step 3: flee from house party bust, unintentionally start a police chase, crash 4xe into a Chic-fil-a, get sent to a wilderness camp for troubled teens.",Jeep
"Not my take, but I heard someone say it and it stuck with me. 

Jeeps are really bad cars.

They‚Äôre really good sport vehicles, which is what they are made for. 

It‚Äôs being compared to vehicles that are built for a completely different purpose.",Jeep

"Nice! I see a few diesels for sale here or there, but never owned one. I know the gas for them is more costly, but you do get better mileage, don't you?",Jeep
That's pretty cool! I was thinking about getting a 3D printer to mess around with. What kind do you have? How do you like it?,Jeep
They're obscenely easy to work on and parts are plentiful.¬†,Jeep

I would try to find an '80s or '90s jeep. Finding one in decent condition may be a bit of a challenge  though.,Jeep
"Or just invest an index fund, probably a better rate of return. Without having to store or maintain a vehicle.",Jeep
Nope,Jeep
"I really like it on my CJ5. The springs really do improve the ride (along with new shocks) a lot over the old ones. I‚Äôve been meaning to see if they make anything for my CJ2A, since the current springs, while new, are pretty stiff.",Jeep
A true JEEP is a dirty JEEP!,Jeep
Yes if fittings get damaged it's 800 dollars for a new tank alone. Inspect the rest of the Jeep carefully. Not a good sign so far,Jeep

I am interested in getting my 16 year old granddaughter a jeep. I don‚Äôt want to get a new one. What would you recommend?,Jeep
"I have definitely wheeled alone more than with people, it‚Äôs not the smartest move albeit but I also don‚Äôt push past my limits when I do. Only had a couple small incidents, nothing I couldn‚Äôt drive back home or now these days to the trailer. Having a good reliable winch and recovery gear is a must. Also go to trails that people frequent, you will always find people willing to help.",Jeep
"My wife and I don't have anything newer than '05. I had a few more XJs, but I've had 3 of them totaled by being rear ended.   That would honestly be my biggest concern,  is someone wrecking it for you.  Oh and start a small stockpile of parts as they start going out of production.",Jeep

Niceüòé not trying to troll or whatever‚Ä¶ but I had those exact wheels on my TJ some years ago and I didn‚Äôt like them only because they were so heavy.,Jeep

"People step into Jeeps from BMWs and Mercedes because they're popular and cool and represent a lifestyle they wish they had.

And then they realize that they ride like tractors, are noisy because the roof and doors aren't structural, and in general are based on a near-100-year-old design at this point.

Those are the type that generally complain about them being 'bad cars'. Because shockingly, a high-CG vehicle with solid axles, doors and a roof that aren't structural and a suspension that wouldn't have been uncommon in the 1950s isn't as comfortable a daily driver as a BMW crossover.",Jeep
"I swap between 3 cars,  an 05 accord, a 95 accord and a 96 grand cherokee. I do dump money into them every year,  but not nearly as much as a car payment. I'm pretty sure the 95 accord is going to outlast the 05, and the jeep is doing great.",Jeep
"Depends on what it‚Äôs like where you plan to wheel. If you‚Äôre within cell phone range, you‚Äôre probably fine by yourself. Just tell somebody where you‚Äôre going and when you plan to be back. 

A winch is a must-have for going alone if there‚Äôs any chance you could get stuck. I learned this the hard way when I got stuck in an icy/snowy spot for several hours before somebody came by. I drove over a very deep frozen puddle and broke through with one wheel. No amount of shoveling could get myself out. If you don‚Äôt have a winch, stick to the dry gravel roads and gentle slopes. 

It never hurts to bring some extra food and water, phone charger, and any tools you might need too",Jeep
Are those cover on the turn signals ?,Jeep
"For JL I believe it‚Äôs the Mopar kit, which I installed on my 2019 2-door JL with 35‚Äù BFGs.  Watch the videos. It was developed by Mopar engineers. I‚Äôm sure there are other aftermarket kits that are good as well, but this is my favorite yet. 

I love it. Rides well onroad and off. It‚Äôs pricey, but everything I‚Äôve read and experienced shows it‚Äôs truly great. Only thing I‚Äôd add is a new steering stabilizer.",Jeep
"Maybe if we all bought stock sport models we'd be ok.....as long as it had the 3.6 with auto transmission.......still waiting on jeeps 3rd clutch recall for my JLUR. Ill be going with aftermarket parts and getting reimbursed rather than let them put another shitty idea/part back in my car......the only saving grace anymore is that there is an entire world of companies making BETTER, mostly, replacement parts.",Jeep

"It‚Äôs the money factor that is hurting you. Is this a 4XE? I‚Äôm assuming it is with a $11k rebate. The best MF from Chrysler Cap should be .00328, which 7.78%.

"No oil leaking anywhere? No smoke from under the hood, where oil could be running down a hot surface and burning off? If not, and you are losing oil: you are burning it. Check the tailpipe for thick, black residue. That code is for a squirrely Oil Pressure switch or a bad oil pump.

"If you don‚Äôt off-road it, you might be able to get away with only minimal rubbing or no rubbing at all; especially with a 35‚Äù that measures closer to 34‚Äù actual.  It would look weird in my opinion as your entire wheel well would be taken up with the bigger tire.  If you do any off roading, you‚Äôd likely need a 2‚Äù lift.",Jeep

We've had everything from early 90s Corolla and Camry to IS300 and RX300.  2 gens of Sequoias and now 2 5th gen and 1 3rd gen 4runners.

"According to the manual for that winch, it will pull 448 amps at peak load. I would recommend nothing smaller than a 500 amp DC contactor triggered by a 12VDC source (your switch).
If you search for 500 amp DC contactor you will see your options. 
I wouldn't recommend going cheap on the contactor and duty cycle requirements as overloading a few hundred amps is a genuine fire hazard.",Jeep

"As someone who owned a 392 Wrangler, which was stolen, and now owns a 3.6L Wrangler I disagree.  Getting up to highway speed on short on-ramps or passing people is much more pleasant in the 392.  The 392 also holds 8th gear with ease on 37‚Äù tires and 4.56 gears.  My 3.6L has 4.88 gears and 37‚Äù tires and drops to 7th on the slightest of inclines or headwinds and will drop to 6th on normal hills.  The 392 has too many low hanging bits that get smashed on rocks, especially the rear muffler, but it‚Äôs the better road machine no doubt.

"I mean, the reason I figured this out is because I almost always do this in my truck to back out the driveway. Early in the morning and it's dark out, and I can't really see my ditch to avoid it.

I found the part number, asked them for it, and that‚Äôs what I was told so im assuming brand new units are planned to be available in April (that‚Äôs for only the control module).

PLEASE READ THIS! If you change the shocks yourself, spray some penetrating oil on the rear upper bolts DAYS IN ADVANCE before you change them.

No car brand has an unblemished quality record. My last Honda was in the shop more in its first year than any of my jeeps have ever been.

"D35 has an oval shaped cover and, if still factory, a rubber drain plug. The only other axle offered by the factory in TJs is a D44. You can do a Google image search to see the difference, or Google ""How to identify Jeep axles"" or something similar. 


I agree with the folks mentioning frame questions. There's no easy fix and the only proper way is replacement. The patches may prolong its life but it's still rusting out behind the repairs unless all of the rust was cut out and replaced with new steel and protected from further corrosion.


I just picked up an absolute cream puff of a 2000 TJ sport, all stock, with low miles, mint condition body, interior and power train for 1k because the frame is toast. I'll have 3 to 4 k in parts by the time I'm done doing a full frame swap so it's worth it, to me, for a nice 5 or 6k TJ when it's done. 


I'd pass on this one and keep looking.",Jeep
"Looks great, but that D35 will explode on you. You will be dumping money into it making it a Super D35 or find a D44 to swap in. I blew up my D35 twice and fixed it twice before saying fuck it and getting a proper Axle. Frame needs a much more thorough investigation, as well as various parts of the body. If the frame was worth repairing, chances are the body was fucked too.

But this winter, the fucking heat went out.  The wrangler is usually our winter vehicle, but I can't drive around in it when it's 40 below inside and out.  The part is ""on backorder"" until late April so it's been sitting in the driveway all winter.   Our 12 year old RAV4 is far more reliable than my wrangler.

"You can certainly fix up a Jeep CJ as a beginner. They‚Äôre pretty basic, and there‚Äôs a ton of info out there. Get on the forums and ask questions. I‚Äôve always gotten really good advice from those folks. 

I‚Äôve enjoyed working on Jeeps for 20+ years. It‚Äôs a way to stay busy, and it‚Äôs been a great way to spend time with my father.

A few pieces of advice, though.

1. Decide how you want to use the Jeep. If you want a show Jeep, it will probably be a different path than if you want a crawler. Do your research and have a plan ahead of time. 

2. Pick your work. Find a Jeep that plays to your strengths. If you like doing body work, find one that‚Äôs got a solid drivetrain but needs a lot of cut/ patch work. If you like turning wrenches, find one with a solid tub and build a motor for it. 

3. Be realistic with yourself in terms of timeline and budget. Depending on the state of the Jeep you‚Äôre rescuing, it can take a lot of time and money to fix them up. Understand that it could take months or years to get it where you want it. Buy parts as you can, and take your time. 

Good luck!",Jeep

"I have the RPM 2.5 kit on my JK and I love it. It is rock solid and has held up to some serious abuse. I haven‚Äôt had to adjust it much at all since it‚Äôs been installed for almost 2 years. 

I have been upgrading my Gladiator and like you I had developed a shake in the steering. I had smashed the stock stabilizer and tie rod on a nasty rock in Colorado last summer and was amazed I was able to continue to wheel and make it home with no issue. I put beadlocks on in December and that‚Äôs when the shake showed up. Decided to replace it with Metalcloak‚Äôs 1 ton kit since I have their 3.5‚Äù GC lift. 

Somehow they sent me a badly threaded tie rod. I couldn‚Äôt tighten it down to set the toe at all. The threads were slipping on the tie rod ends. I worked with them and after overnighting me tie rod ends and still having the same issue, I ended up FaceTiming with them to show what I was witnessing. They were surprised at the poor quality and overnighted me a new tie rod and now everything is good. I have wheeled it twice and the drag link does love to come loose as my steering wheel is wonky everytime, but the design does make it easy to adjust as well.

"Your axels are absolutely fine for running 35‚Äùs without extra reinforcement.  If you wanted to really beat on your Jeep it may be worth it but for most off-roading that wouldn‚Äôt be required.  I‚Äôve been running 35‚Äùs on my JK for 5 years.  It takes a toll on sub components like ball joints that are stressed by the added weight so over time there will be more,‚Äôor at least more rapid maintenance required, but not the kind of stuff that‚Äôs damaging the axels.   

Regearing is a fine idea but not mandatory.  I didn‚Äôt because my Jeep is a daily driver and honestly I‚Äôm fine with the stock gears.  It‚Äôs good enough for the trails I tackle and I can manage the slight loss of power on the road just fine, my lead foot makes up for it usually.   When the time comes to truly modify my diffs I‚Äôm not going to simply regear I‚Äôll add lockers and go bananas but for now I‚Äôm going to wear out my diffs the old fashioned way before I replace them.  

For wheels, you are correct the 7.5 is too narrow for 35‚Äôs.  The main issue is the offset or backspacing depending on how you look at it.  The stock wheels are snug in the wheel wells and tight to the frame which causes the wider tires to rub internally on components.  Wider wheels with better backspacing will sit further out past the fender and away from the frame, preventing rubbing.  They will also be compatible for mounting 35‚Äùs which usually run 11.5-12.5 inches wide depending on the exact tire, thus the need for a wider wheel.",Jeep

"A 1998 Grand Cherokee (commonly called a ZJ) with a 5.9 in Limited trim is a pretty desirable rig amongst those in the know. Especially one with less than 100k miles. If it‚Äôs nice and everything works, that‚Äôs a good price.¬†

¬†But, it‚Äôs a 26 year old Chrysler product. ZJs were awesome when they were new, but they often have electrical gremlins. They‚Äôre relatively easy to work on, it‚Äôs an old pushrod v8, minimal sensors compared to a modern vehicle and OBDii. A good choice for a DIY kind of person. Fortunately, they‚Äôre a bit of an enthusiast vehicle now and there‚Äôs tons of support online in forums and Facebook groups. You‚Äôre going to need to search for 93-98 Grand Cherokee ZJ groups. ZJs share almost nothing with wranglers, cherokees, libertys, etc. Wrangler guys are enthusiastic, but don‚Äôt care about ZJs or XJs for the most part. You need to find the ZJ groups. ¬†¬† ¬†

By the way.. ¬†Every Chrysler vehicle of the past 30 or so years got a 2 letter designation that they used internally when building them and today, guys refer to them using those letters pretty commonly. For some Jeep examples:¬† ¬†

ZJ = 93-98 Grand Cherokee, ¬† XJ = 84-01 Cherokee, ¬†YJ = 87-96 Wrangler, ¬†TJ = 97-06 Wrangler, ¬†WJ = 99-04 Grand Cherokee, ¬†KJ = 02-07 Liberty, ¬† ¬†

That all being said, if that Grand checks out ok, go for it. Even if you drive it a few months and decide to sell, there is absolutely another ZJ enthusiast who will step up to buy your low mileage 98 5.9 rig, probably at a profit. It‚Äôs a one-year-only deal for that engine in the final year of ZJ. Its desirable.¬†",Jeep
"The 35C is fine if you don't put a locker in it and drive like a complete asshole. It can be hard to be easy on the gas if you're off roading with a stick, but without a locker, the 35c is fine.

Just be gentle on the gas and understand that if you want to put a locker in the back, you'll want to combine it with an axle upgrade.

"I‚Äôm doing this on my JK.  I‚Äôve got a set of Xtreme recon wheels off a 392 mated with a set of Goodyear 315/70/17‚Äôs that came off a new bronco.  Prior to these tires I ran 35/12.5/17 BFG KO2‚Äôs for 55k miles or so.  Both sets of tires are all terrains (the new goodyears are branded as mud terrains but they simple aren‚Äôt, they have the tread pattern and depth of an AT).  Both are good, I like the bfg‚Äôs slightly more thus far.  The Goodyears are pretty damn quiet but the bfg‚Äôs were slightly quieter. Compared to an MT they are both dead silent.  The bfg‚Äôs were also better in sand than the goodyears.  Bit wider so that‚Äôs likely why.  

I don‚Äôt have a ton of experience wheeling MT‚Äôs so I can‚Äôt give you advice there but I‚Äôve driven a ton on road when working at a 4x4 shop and the on road experience is way better with AT‚Äôs.  Which is why I run them since I daily my Jeep.

"I did the same thing last summer. I was trying to find someone to trade doors with for months, but ended up just buying a pair on eBay and having them painted. I was surprised how well the paint matched. I had the locks rekeyed while I was at it. I never really need to lock them, but since I had to take off the interior panels before paint, I figured why not. The plan was to sell my full doors, but I eventually just realized I'd rather keep both sets. So now I have hangers for both sets in the garage.

Half doors rock. I prefer them over any other setup in the summer. Perfect arm rest height, and the Jeep looks awesome with the top down. That body line is so perfect. You won't regret it!",Jeep

"This. People fail to realize that companies are simply going to raise their prices if they can. Inflation is basically an arms race of employers and their employees being able to raise their prices if the market can bear it, because that's all they can do. Then everyone else tries to do the same when they see it working. People don't really seem to remember/know that in the vast majority of companies, cost of labor is the main cost input. 

At a certain point that simply causes tons of damage to the employers who can't due it due to the nature of their business (long contracts etc).

This is why the federal reserve exists. Large inflationary spikes literally just lead to business models breaking due to massive shifts in market demand, which leads to people losing their jobs where they otherwise wouldn't have.",Jeep

"I'd say it depends on what the rig is you're installing it on and what your end goal is. How comprehensive of a lift you want. Budget. 

I'm a Johnny Joint advocate, I like Currie/Rock Jock, Genright. I've installed several lifts by other manufacturers, though. Metalcloak and Teraflex on new shit is good. AEV for a more basic good functioning lift that retains factory ride/travel. BDS, Old Man Emu make good stuff.

For a TJ, Savvy or Currie (Rock Jock)

Stay away from Rough Country and SkyJacker. Stay away from poly bushings.

Biggest place people go cheap and screw up an otherwise good lift is on the shocks. Buy good shocks. Falcon, Fox. King if you're a baller and have the rest of the suspension for it not to go to waste. Rancho/Bilstein if you want something more affordable but good. 

My TJ is Savvy Mid Arm. My JT is a pieced together mix of AEV/Mopar/Rock Jock/Fox",Jeep

A 1.5 lift isn't much and you will soon want more. 

I say go straight to a 3.5 with 37s and never look back.  

Yes those stock axles are fine.   You can even run 37s if you plan on just light offroading.  Reinforcing the axles would probably be recommended at that point, at least the front. 

My only advice is,  regardless of what lift you go with,  remember; you get what you played for.  I personally really like Clayton offroad or Metalcloak. But there are many other reputable kits out there.",Jeep

You won‚Äôt catch me wheeling alone. There is no cell service where it is legal to off-road in my area, and a there are too many things that can go wrong out in the bush, no matter how well prepared you are (mechanical/electrical failure with your vehicle or recovery gear, roll your jeep with no anchor points to self-recover, hell, even just getting stuck with nowhere to anchor to). The nearest town to the areas I go 4x4ing can be 50+ kms away down rough logging roads. It‚Äôs also bear country, and I keep a 45-70 when we are out in the bush, but I don‚Äôt feel like walking 50km hefting that thing around.

I‚Äôm honestly astounded by the number of people in this thread saying is perfectly fine to go alone. Maybe their idea of off-roading is just logging roads, but who knows.

That particular engine...They made, literally, \*millions\* of them! They go into a ton of different vehicles and they are super reliable, as long as they are maintained. A good inspection and OBD data will show if it was well maintained. Again, I am more concerned with the \*frame\* than the drive train. Drive train stuff can be fixed.

They use the stock ecu have all the typical emissions stuff and also come with a factory warranty, its essentially the same thing as this jeep.

"This is a discontinued set. I think when they were full price they were around $1200 when I got mine if they are the aluminum ones. They are going to need to be repainted by whoever gets them, and anytime something isn't plug and play that hurts the value.

I'd put them online for $600 and see if anybody bites. You could also make the decision to strip them yourself and just have them primered and you might get a bit more for them.

Look around on crutchfield for aftermarket head units, they're also great at putting together install gear and harness packages when you buy a head unit from them.  Stick with brands like Alpine, Kenwood, Sony, Pioneer or JVC and you can't really go wrong as far as sound quality goes.

"They need more maintenance than the average family car, if you drive them as intended off the pavement. Jeeps are driven on rough gravel roads, through water, snow, mud and other abusive road surfaces that can introduce grime into the moving parts. This causes wear on the components. Mud is the worst for getting into universal joints and seals meant to keep oil in. If you have a Jeep you need to look under it once and a while to see if any thing seems warn or leaking. Many people put much larger tires on the Jeep than what came from the factory and that also causes things to wear out. Owning a Jeep is like loving a Bi-polar person, most of the time they are great fun, but a bad day with a Jeep can be a really bad day. If you are the type of person that is not afraid to tinker on your rig or have a mechanic friend to help out they are worth the maintenance.

"X years/Y miles warranties are always for whichever happens first, so you're not going to make any progress on that front.

Is yours a JK or a JL (they made both in 2018)?

For the JL they *supposedly* have a fix (new hinges with a zinc shim to act as a sacrificial anode). The fix hasn't been out for long enough to know whether it's actually viable long-term or if it just pushes the problem out beyond the warranty period more consistently though.

If it's the worst bubbling they've ever seen on a Jeep, I'd be surprised if you got out for less than $5,000...probably more. And they are right, even if it gets fixed, there's no guarantee that it won't happen again. That said, this is a known issue on JK and JL Wranglers, so even if you sell it and get a new wrangler there's no guarantee it won't happen again unless you get a TJ or earlier model. If it is a JL and you out to get it fixed make sure they do the TSB with the new hinges.",Jeep
"I'm not sure what you mean by ""bad cars"", but I will freely admit that if all I used it for was on-road stuff I would say my LJR is a pretty bad car. 

The live front axle makes the steering vague, the height makes the step in awkward, it has a lot of wind noise on the highway and the gas mileage sucks.

But it really shines off road where very few cars can go.",Jeep
"Oh yeah. Plus, if it‚Äôs an actual Rubicon, it‚Äôs even rarer. I‚Äôm looking to sell my non-rubicon LJ for about 15-16k and it only has 75k. But a Rubicon with 43k miles, I could easily see going for high 20s.",Jeep

Does your winch not have a toggle switch for power where you plug in the handheld controller? I have the same winch and mine does. I don‚Äôt know if they updated it since I bought mine.

"The traction control system (TCS) detects if a loss of traction occurs among the car's wheels. Upon identifying a wheel that is losing its grip on the road, the system automatically applies the brakes to that individual one or cut down the car's engine power to the slipping wheel.

It is not a BA10/5 because those have a case half that  bolts together longitudinally down the middle like a suit case.  The one pictured bolts together transversely.  From what I can see of the bellhousing, it has an AX5 feel to it, but I just cannot see enough of what I need to see to tell for sure. Yes, you can put an AX15 onto a Dodge Dakota Bellhousing from a 4 cylinder and put it behind a Jeep, but you haven't given us a lot of vehicle history or data to go by. Can you do any more bellhousing shots directly over the top of the transmission, in case you don't happen to have any magnets handy........",Jeep

"Likely a failed rocker. Sounds pretty bad, so it might have caused camshaft damage depending on how long it's been ticking. 

It's a time consuming job, but not overly difficult. First time I fixed one I just loosened the cam bearing caps and wiggled the rocker in/out. Next time I did it, I locked the cams in place, pulled the cams, and installed 12 all new lifters/rockers to be safe (my cam was also damaged, so I installed a new cam too). Locking the cams and releasing the chain tension was way easier than I expected. I got the tools off Amazon for ~$30. I very much recommend replacing all the rockers/lifters on the side your working on so you don't have another fail shortly after. 

The hardest part of the whole job was probably removing the PCV valve off the rear of the passenger side valve cover. It's just two small torx, but there is absolutely zero working room. It's worth it to go ahead and replace the PCV while you're there. Getting the battery tray out and all the wires and hoses and crap out of the way is the other hardest part probably. The actual engine work isn't bad.

Edit. This guys videos are the best and most complete videos explaining the process imo.

"It's going to depend on the prep. If you do all the prep, and all they have to do is roll it in and paint? Pretty cheap: Prob $1500-2k for a \*good\* quality paint job. But...That means you have to take it apart, remove everything you don't want painted, then put it all back together again. You can get the Maaco special, but they generally don't do a lot of prep work. Their paint jobs aren't known for their longevity, either. Might want to look into a wrap...They expensive too, but you have a lot of options and flexibility.",Jeep

4 trips to the shop, each time I have to wait months for parts and the service. Takes a day to fix each time and have never gotten a loaner. Numerous recalls.

Depending on the tire wall thickness or ply 3/6/10 it can add excessive and unnecessary weight for what your application is. BFG all terrains are hands down one of the best options or Cooper all terrains. I went with 33inch tires due to the overall ply/weight ratio. I keep 22.5mpg highway and can still maintain great off road capability even on the rockier terrain. Just remember if you go from 31.5 stock tires to 35 10ply tires it‚Äôs going to cost you gasmilage. You will also want to think about re-gearing your differential so that your engine won‚Äôt struggle too much.,Jeep
Both marketplace and eBay. People will lay the doors on their side on the hard concrete and knock all the paint off the corners and then I assume they get rained on because the entire edge will be rusted.

"I sold my ‚Äò22 4xe earlier this month after basically having Wranglers for 20 years. 

That thing was constantly in the shop, too.

Rear axle shaft bent with normal off road use. Because the seals were affected they wouldn‚Äôt cover the differential fluid replacement. 

They had the wiring wrong from the factory so it was shorting the PCM. Took them over a month to fix that issue. Dealer was miserable to work with. Getting reimbursement for my lost time with Chrysler was a huge hassle. 

Shocks were leaking. They had to order them. Took 4 months to get the parts. 

Had a total of 4 recalls including the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt charge it and park it outside because it might catch on fire‚Äù recall.

I started with a 2006 2-door unlimited, but the quality just seemed to keep going downhill with each generation. 

Jeep really has fulfilled the acronym of Just Empty Every Pocket lately. Super fun cars, but I don‚Äôt trust them.",Jeep
Better get on the Toyota sun and figure out what issues await you over on that side.,Jeep
"Most of the work has already been done. The engine itself is well established, the jeep has already seen different factory installed lift configurations, the ecu already speaks the same language, and Im sure Im missing a number of other similarities, not to mention Im sure they did market research looking at all the third party swaps and options available and learned a lot from that. At the point of them deciding to create this model the development work would largely have been selection of vehicle config, tweaking to refine the integration of all of it, some styling work, and then testing and further refinement. Does that cost money? Sure, but they arent designing a new model from the ground up.

To look at it from a different angle, to go to a jeep shop somewhere, its generally around $30-35k for a V8 swap. That cost includes removal of all the old parts and install of the stuff and whatever integration work they need to do if the engine installed isnt a Chrysler product (likely an LS) or anything else that comes up. If they are doing it at the factory on a new vehicle there is no removal or anything, its a clean slate so no extra labour cost (except for whatever the delta is between the 392 and 3.6L). So, for a $50k vehicle to double in price for this is quite excessive.",Jeep

"As someone who has done a frame off resto-mod on an ‚Äò86‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs one of the easiest vehicles to do a resto on, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs easy.

Restorations are FILLED with pitfalls. That frame you thought was perfect? Turns out it was patched by some yodel with a $99 harbor freight welder in a spot you couldn‚Äôt see until you pulled the body. That ugly red spot in the paint? Turns out the whole Jeep was originally that color and the color you liked in the first place was sprayed over it at Earl Scheib. The loss of power in the engine? Blowby that necessitates a rebuild or replacement.

This is how all restorations go. As long as you are ready to accept the fact that you will wind up fixing or replacing at least 3x as many things as you originally thought were needed and it will take 5-10x as long as you originally planned, it can be a LOT of fun and very rewarding.

And like I said, a CJ is a relatively easy choice as far as restos go. Almost every inch of wiring is easy to get to. The body on frame (as opposed to unibody) construction means rust is not always a death sentence, especially if you have welding experience. The enormous market for aftermarket and NOS parts means you will almost never struggle to find that bit or bob that you need, and the level of community support you will find is outstanding. Not to mention the fact that the only glass is a single, flat piece unless you‚Äôre doing a hard top too.

I don‚Äôt regret a single minute of my project, and if you‚Äôve got the heart and dedication to see it through, you won‚Äôt either‚Ä¶ just make sure you‚Äôre aware of what a restoration really means‚Ä¶ empty your wallet, quit your job, get rid of all your friends, and install a heater, AC, and coffee maker in your garage!!!!",Jeep

"I worked for a massive auto manufacturer as a tech, particularly in the paint shop. I‚Äôd like to chime in on the parts availability. 

There are plenty of spare parts in production as far as hoods, doors, etc. Believe it or not the tricky part is painting them in large batches without impeding on normal production numbers (which is FAR more important to manufacturers than painting spare parts). 

Painting spare parts cuts into every stage of paint production, which often times are not well suited to painting parts individually, specifically hoods and trunks/hatches.",Jeep

"Those look like aftermarket lower arms, and at least one axle (but presumably both) has a relocation bracket for the track bar. 

Photos 2 and 3 clearly show a slip yoke, so that hasn't been eliminated, unfortunately. 

Going back to stock would involve replacing the lower arms with the crap stock ones, removing the relocation brackets for the track bar, removing bumpstop extensions, swapping springs, swapping shocks, etc. 

Dropping to a 2"" lift would be something between what you have and stock. A 2"" lift is usually a budget driven thing, though. They're about getting a tiny bit of extra clearance for cheap by sacrificing suspension geometry and ride quality. When you get to 4"" lifts, the geometry and ride quality is usually improved by making the extra changes needed so that the suspension functions more correctly. 

If you're concerned about the ride quality, a) why'd you buy a real Jeep in the first place?  And b) I'd suggest either improving what you have with new shocks, measured bumpstops and a SYE; or undoing everything and returning to stock. A 2"" lift is probably the worst option, at least in *my* opinion.

I have no idea why it would be $3k to find out, I‚Äôd bring it to a few places to shop around because the dealership charged me the $150 inspection fee + parts and labor, came out to around $800. Of course yours can be more complicated than mine, but $3k to find seems dumb. I‚Äôve also replaced my engine (result of a driver hitting my front end, totaled my jeep but I owner retained & fixed back up), if you‚Äôre thinking about that mine came out to $12k +/- at a local mechanic using a brand new 0 mile engine bought from the dealership (this includes new oil & water pumps, thermostat, and oil cooler to get the 3yr 100k mile warranty).

"Take care of it and it will take care of you. That's what my grandpa always said. Maintenance is key, an American vehicle is usually cheaper to maintain especially if you do a lot of your own work. It is a 2018 though so vehicles have gotten quite complex but this model has been around for some time and nothing major I can recall would cause issues, other than the oil filter housing. Currently have a 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee with 280k miles, made it to 30 years, sadly the transmission is giving me trouble. I think it's worth a rebuild though. I got it about 6 years ago from my in laws who were the second owner. Since then I have replaced or upgraded like 80% of the suspension, most accessories on the engine, bodies fairly clean, and the interior needs a little more work but I've already fixed up a few things. It makes a rebuild worth it since the rest of the vehicle has been kept up, you let it go and suddenly dropping money on a beat up car doesn't make sense. I may spending money here and there but not more than a car payment.",Jeep
"It very much depends on the dealer and the type of maintenance. The bar for ‚Äòbrand standards‚Äô is at an all-time low. The best you can really hope for is ‚Äòcompetent, well-trained, but overworked‚Äô. 

Industry practice is to put the mouth breathers on oil change and rotation duty. But torque specs are as important with the most basic service as they are with your suspension. I would never, *ever* trust any dealer for an oil change on a 3.6 again, and I‚Äôm convinced that they are the cause of 90% of the oil cooler failures on that engine.

Most of the frequent tasks are just so simple on a Wrangler that I‚Äôd rather not chance letting someone else wrench on it if I can avoid it. Doing an oil change in my garage requires 2 minutes of effort and 20 minutes of waiting, and I can be certain that no one‚Äôs overfilling my oil or letting the old filter drip all over the alternator belt.",Jeep

They are using the parts to build new ones so they can get more buyers. The reason for limited parts production is likely staffing. They shift the priority to the new customers because they believe in today's ""post-covid"" world, it's ok to have shitty customer service and ridiculously long turn-around times for parts and repairs. This is industry wide and not even just in the auto industry. Think about you past few sit-down restaurant experiences and other customer service related experiences you've had lately. I don't know if we're ever going back. Once the manufacturers realized they can make the same or more profit with lesser overhead (Staff) they won't look back. Despite an inferior product or customer experience.",Jeep

"Stock axles are fine with 35s. I'm assuming the 24' sport has a Dana 30 front and Dana 44 rear. Both of these axles can handle 35s no problem especially if you're not hard core crawling. The cheapest way to give your axles better support for insane off-roading is to take the jeep to a 4x4 shop and have them weld gussets on your axle. It'd be smart to weld gussets on your steering knuckles as well if you go this route. You could install chrome moly axel shafts but I doubt you have enough torque to snap an axle shaft with light off-roading. Your jeep is much more resilient than you think. The best things you can do for the Jeep right now is a 3"" lift and 35"" tires. Your stock wheels are fine, but 1.5"" wheel spacers would be smart. I'm running stock wheel with 1.5"" spacers and zero rubbing. You really want to go with a bigger lift right away. Once you throw an after market bumper on there your 1.5"" lift is  gone.",Jeep

So our plan is get the transmission at least working so i can drive it. Then im going to get basically all stock suspension because the lift suspension is fine just basically needs all new bushings and we cant find out what suspension it is (even if it come out i can always just put a lift back on later down the line). Then and probably the final thing that it needs currently is the drivers side body mount is done for. Everything else is manageable to leave alone for now",Jeep

I would say go inspect it, have your mechanic throw an OBD on it to check the live data for misfires, temps, pressures, etc. Check an OBD setting called ""Miles since CEL reset"" if he can. If it's something like 40k miles: Good. If it's 3 miles...? Not so good. Means something was done to reset the Check Engine light and you should be wary. But, it looks good from what I can see.

I also have the Klipper touchscreen upgrade (comes with a touchscreen already but the Klipper upgrade allows me to print over wifi, print higher quality, and quicker, that was $100).

You probably have all the tools you need to maintain one already and Sovol gives you quite a few tools and replacements for the run rate parts (like the nozzle).

You use a program called a slicer to turn an STL file like the one pictured in my post to G code for your specific printer to execute (Sovol includes an SD card/USB adapter so you can easily install the software to your desktop)

Lastly, you will need to get the files by either learning how to CAD or do what 99% of 3D printer owners do and find them on sites like Thingiverse.

- Cabin Heating or Cooling

- Fuel Oil Refresh Mode

It's been cold, so cabin heating could be expected (turn off the air and just use seat and steering wheel heater?) but FORM is because of how the oil system works, you basically wanna heat the oil up to 194F or higher for about 20-30 minutes to clear that.

It's because gas and oil mix in the system and you gotta evaporate the gas out.

Put it in gas only mode, turn the heater on, and go for a highway drive to clear FORM, that actually is how you do it.

"If I was you I would assume the locking mechanism itself is seized due to rust and gunk.  Because the door is locked, you will probably have a hell of a time getting to that and fixing it.  The lock itself is at the end of the metal Rod that‚Äôs wrapped in fabric inside your door.  That rod is like a thick coat hanger and presses into the lock.  I would try to get a good vantage point into the door with a flashlight to spot the lock and spray the shit out of it with WD40, and if you buy the rust penetrating one it may help even further.  Soak the lock itself, see if that helps break up the corrosion. Let it soak over night if need be.  Then get in that door with a pair of sturdy pliers with thick handles for you to grip, grab that rod and give the lock hell to see if you can break the seize.  That rod obviously slides front the front to back of the vehicle.  Don‚Äôt tug too hard side to side (so driver to passenger) or it can pull out of the lock.  You can press it back in if that happens but it‚Äôll be a headache.  

Hopefully you can free the lock, after which I‚Äôd disassemble the door to remove the lock and clean the shit out of it.  You can get them good as new and grease them and it‚Äôll work for another 25 years.

Low tread up front leads to hydroplaning and lose of control.  It rains a lot in the Pacific North West.  DOT reg says min tread depth on your front axle is 4/32nds, and rear is 2/32nds.  So I'd put your best 2 used tires on the rear, and your new set on the front.",Jeep

I‚Äôd be weary of gears if you want it to drive like stock, but it won‚Äôt be unsafe on stock gears. I‚Äôd take it off-road stock and see where it underperforms, that‚Äôll be your best gauge. For example, if you worry about parts breaking from making impact with obstacles, upgrade it even for the peace of mind sometimes.

That being said, one thing I highly recommend with running any set of larger tires is to upgrade some steering components. At 1.5‚Äù you won‚Äôt need much, but I‚Äôd recommend a good set of ball joints (I‚Äôve had great experience with teraflex‚Äôs as well as dynatrac‚Äôs).

Mine was driving along at random times and my Jeep (2014 jku) rpm's would jump increase about 800 - 1000 and my abs/traction control lights would kick on. I would let off the gas and sometimes it would turn off and other I'd tap the gas and then let off and it would turn off. I got sick of messing with it and just pulled the fuse. Again this has been probably about a couple of years. I'm now at the point where I just want to resolve it. I too have looked at the module be it the whole pump or just the pc part. I did find that on the sticker on your pillar where it shows build date that mine is May of 2014. That being said a new one before June 29th 2014 is more expensive than Jeeps built after june 29th 2014. Other things Jeep I've also found parts for models 2015+. So this tells me that 2014/2015 was a year which some things changed. I'm still perplexed by all this.

Oh sorry I've swapped out all my sensors and I've also been battling my rear brake pads on the driver side wearing much much faster. I've swapped out the caliper twice now.

"my 2017 is at around 90k miles now. I bought her new.  I haven't had any significant problems. Sure a couple things went wrong. some seal gave out and she leaked oil for a bit. I got it fixed. Something went wrong with the engine thermostat. The check engine light told me and i got it fixed.  IF i ignored either of those, i likely would have destroyed the engine at some point. But that's the same as any car.

my previous car was an xterra and the same kind of stuff happened. hell, one time the gas guage went out in my xterra. i thought i had a quarter tank still. The truck died, seemingly for no reason, and stranded me on the side of the highway. I was miles from any exit, in a midwest blizzard with snowplows blasting past. nothing like that has ever gone wrong with my jeep, and that's a car with presumed Japanese build quality.

The one thing that the xterra did have on the jeep was in 150k miles,  the doors never got leaky, but new door seals in the jeep fixed that. That's just a mere annoyance though. that's not an unreliable lemon of a vehicle.

ok. the other thing the xterra had was that roof box. it was a cool place to keep ice cream sandwiches in the dead of winter.

The thing with jeeps is they perform poorly on quantifiable tests that magazines come up with and people feel are important. They are loud. they don't handle well. they are not aerodynamic.   
  
They get poor fuel economy, but honestly, it's not by much. It's a lot worse than a prius, sure. but its not THAT much worse. i get around 18mpg. a 2017 subaru outback would likely have gotten 21 in the same situation. Is the jeep worse? technically yes, but not on the level that people would have you believe.  i get better mileage than my buddy's porsche, and i've made it through blizzards and mudslides in the mountains that the porsche couldnt.  

The main problem with jeeps is they are so damn expensive, and if you want a roofbox for winter ice cream, you have to buy it aftermarket. if you want roof bars, you have to buy it aftermarket. It's kind of cool that they are a blank slate that you can make your own, but  it's pricey for the features you get, that's really the worst thing about them.",Jeep

"I meannnnn the issues I‚Äôve had aren‚Äôt specific to jeep imo. The hose went out and so did the coolant reservoir but all the plastics issues i‚Äôve had is due to heat. 


- heater core hose blew up, 54k miles 4 years old 

- coolant reservoir took a shit right after that too. 

- steering box tsb 

- real axle leaked so they replaced 

- sunvisor broke - $8 fix from amazon 

- still chasing an oil leak but that‚Äôs a WIP 

But aside from that, shit that breaks is usually cause people treat them harshly cause you know, hardcore rugged off-roader. So they don‚Äôt really think to do the maintenance if you‚Äôre off-roading or beating the shit out it. 

But imo no, not bad cars, just keep up with maintenance and make the maintenance sooner if you‚Äôre harder on a car and you‚Äôll be fine.",Jeep

"Depends on your location, but that sounds about right. Honestly, higher than I expected. What do you place the value at?

For instance, if they gave you $4000 for it, and you found one on auto trader that was the exact, oh-my-God -it's-my-Jeep, perfect duplicate of yours, would you give them $4000 +tax/fees? Or would you try to talk them down and get it for less? Because that's what replacement value would actually be.

"I hear ya. Problem is, without a proper diagnosis, it's real hard to guess. So what you want to do is request a proper diagnosis. Why is this vehicle not starting? Then, once they give you a diagnosis, you ask for an esitimate on the repair, meaning the ""repair"" should be fixing whatever is keeping the vehicle from starting. The wording is important. If you are spending money, you want to make sure the money is spent towards a specific goal. Not just throwing parts at it and hoping for the best.

If you want a 20 year lifespan, you're going to be relying on a lot of aftermarket parts and scraping junkyards and wrecker websites.  Start identifying hard to find parts now and stockpile.

For example, there are zero original TJ PCMs you can buy.  There are some junkyard ones, but there's also a good chance the vehicle was scrapped because of a PCM failure.  There is one Florida Man who takes other Chrysler PCMs (I think from PT Cruisers) and will hack the unit to work with your VIN.  If he ever decides to retire, every TJ will go extinct.",Jeep

">The Jeep Wrangler and Gladiators, especially the 4xe, are one of a kind in the market place, but their high price and poor reliability/service are really hurting them.

The Trigger switches work fine and I wired an ARB compressor through it for power on/off. That was easy since their wiring included an offshoot to run to a switch. The winch is wired to go directly to the battery or through the Apex remote power switch then to the battery. Any advice or direction would be greatly appreciated. Haven't found much online.

"The scatpack challenger doesn't have 4wd, sells way more units to spread the development and engineering costs, doesn't have to spin 35"" tires, and doesn't have to be strengthened for heavier offroad use. The TRX starts at $96k (the regular 392 starts a little cheaper at $91k) and also sells way more units. And if you want to compare another limited vehicle like the 392 Final Edition, the 2024 TRX Final Edition starts at $120k. And if you think that the difference between the base wrangler and the 392 is ""just an engine,"" then you're really really not paying attention.",Jeep
"Yea, I couldn't find them with a regular OBD reader either. I had to get a Bluetooth OBD reader and download the app JScan to finally see them.

"Our family has had... 1997 Cherokee V6. 2004 Grand Cherokee V8. 2008 Commander V8. 2023 Wrangler JLU V6. 

97 went through me driving it as a 16 year old and then brother brother took it over when he hit 16. Ran for 180,000 miles then we traded it in on my dad's 2012 Challenger. 

The head gasket went out on 2004 and we traded it in on 2016 Ram. Only had 105,000 miles, don't know what happened to it. 

2008 Commander AWD V8 with Mercedes engine had a new engine put in at 125,000 miles because something clogged the cooling channels and the head warped. Running great at 160,000 miles now. Still my winter baby! 

2023 Wrangler has 1500 miles on it. It's my summer baby. No issues and I love my first Wrangler! 

My mom also has a 2016 V6 Charger AWD with 100,000 miles and loves it. She traded a 1997 Sebring in on it. 

We have had GMs in the family and have never really had any problems with any vehicle. Maybe we are lucky. All vehicles mentioned were purchased brand new, so maybe there is something to the ""bad owner"" comment. We just love our Mopars!",Jeep

"Well, with 264k miles on a 24 yr old Jeep, you can expect some huffing and puffing after a cold start! Mine is 12 yrs old, with 162k miles and I try to give it plenty of time to warm up before I get into traffic and have to do 50mph or more. I actually drive the opposite way down my street, away from the main drag. Then I cut over, and go up the next block for a distance of just under half a mile, just to let it warm up at 10-12mph. By the time I jump on the main drag, it's over half warmed up, and everything from the diff's, bearings, trans, motor, power steering, etc are warming up nicely and there isn't as much stress on my Jeep when I stomp it to get into traffic...Just something that I have always done and it seems to help.",Jeep
"I don't think so, I put the old one out and it came out like that and the other piece wasn't there in the hole, it must be living inside the wheel bearing/hub area idk",Jeep

"I wouldn‚Äôt if you don‚Äôt have a lot of experience. Depending where you are located, I look on Facebook for a local Jeep or Off-road club. Some forums list them as well by state and ways to get in touch. 

If it‚Äôs a park or popular trail, you could always post up by the trail head and ask to join another group. 

As for wheeling alone, if you have all the tools and accessories to self recover and experience, then you can do it. I lead rides a lot for my club and do a lot of prerunning and research on my own. But I‚Äôve been wheeling for 15+ years and know my Jeep and capabilities. I don‚Äôt do anything dumb when alone. And I am also equipped with as much knowledge on the area as possible.",Jeep

For now its good to have a solid reliable vehicle that just needs general maintenance.",Jeep

I like how they scratched out the FG and BG. I would have asked them to see those numbers hahaha,Jeep
Tis indeed,Jeep
They certainly have some bad design choices and terrible customer service but that‚Äôs seems to be most car manufacturers these days. Personally I think they‚Äôve overpriced their value by a large margin so I wouldn‚Äôt buy one unless you can get a crazy good deal.,Jeep

I went with RareParts load carrying ball joints and their 2-ton cartridge style drag link and tie Rod.  Never felt more solid.  Had a bitchin alignment after that and the guy added as much positive caster as he could.  Almost drives like a car.  Maybe with skinnier wheels it might.,Jeep

"There are literally some businesses that exist solely on the hopes that they will become profitable (see: uber/food delivery bullshit etc). Some of those jobs purely shouldn't exist because the market (demand) doesn't support them at that time, but they do.  Seattle passed legislation to force delivery services to pay gig workers like 26$ an hour.. all it did was tank the demand into the ground because the unprofitable business simply passed this on to the customer.

If replacement parts become a more viable option due to demand going up, someone will start manufacturing them.

Realistically it is likely that the whole situation is a lot more complicated.   Thinking that people who are well off hate people is a bit wild my guy, it's more likely that due to inflation from covid, getting access to capital to spin up production facilities is significantly more expensive and the time horizon for capital to get cheaper to do that vs have some losses on replacement parts means it makes more sense to wait.  


Life is more nuanced than simply that people just hate others and want to treat them poorly. Especially given that those people are responsible for their compensation",Jeep
I will keep it short and say this. I work at a Chrysler dealership and the amount of electric wranglers we see on a daily basis and the amount of buy backs we work on that FCA bought back is mind blowing. As a company we should never ever have gotten into EV's.,Jeep
"Just take care of it. Don't skimp on maintenance. As it ages, don't start putting off oil changes, or going for cheap components, etc...

My previous Jeep was a '92 Cherokee that I just got rid of last year. My current Jeep is an '07, and I will not be replacing it any time soon. My first Jeep was almost 20 years old when I first got it. It was a '77 I started driving in the mid 90s.

Cars can easily last 20 years if you just perform the needed maintenance. That's the tough one. It seems less and less important as the vehicle ages and loses its luster, but that really IS the key. Cars SHOULD last 20 years, including our Jeeps.",Jeep

"They‚Äôre going to be a very difficult sell. If somebody with mojito needs them, you could probably get north of $500 for the pair, but it may take you a year to sell them. If you want to sell them quickly, I‚Äôd guess 150-250 would move them. When you advertise them, point out that you can run them without the rest of the hardtop as a sun shade on a topless Jeep. Might get more interest.",Jeep

"I bought a 2017 JKU right when they were starting to tool over to the new model. It was built for me, had a mile on it when I took ownership of it, and by 800 miles the manual transmission in it was making noises. I brought it back to the dealer, they told me I was crazy and there‚Äôs nothing wrong, so I took it home for a couple weeks, same problem, and I brought it back. They had a specialist look at it then reported that the transmission was completely fucked due to a manufacturer defect that was known but not recall and would require a complete transmission replacement. This was only maybe four months into owning it, they then told me that the soonest they thought it would be done by eight months out. I called them every day and bitched and complained, and eventually I got Chrysler directly involved. Chrysler actually wound up doing right by me and sent me a check for two months worth of car payments since I was paying $500 a month to not drive my jeep. I wound up finding a different shop who got it done a lot quicker, but it really soured me on jeep and on Chrysler products.

"Well...Not big on ""car"" stuff, eh? lol...That's ok. Yes: there are lines, full of fluid, going to each wheel. The fluid is used to (hydraulically) close the brake calipers and (hopefully) stop the vehicle. When you press the pedal, pressure goes up, so (in your case) you have a leak and that is where your fluid is squirting out. This would probably mean the mechanic did a crap job or made a mistake (like reusing rusty stuff to save money) and they should be happy to fix that for you. Not sure what the check engine light was for: doesn't typically come on for brakes afaik, but maybe? I would take it back and tell them their work needs double checking.",Jeep
