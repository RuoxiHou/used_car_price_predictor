The engine is actually needing to be rebuilt but instead we thought we we just replaced the entire engine. Do you know where i can find the list of all the accessories i need like you said? Also how much did it cost you to get your engine rebuilt?,Hummer
"Mine used to come on when hot. In fact, thats how I bought my H3 so cheap. I did a few of things: 1) installed a mechanical gauge with real oil pressure, 2) disconnected the oil idiot light as its dumb, 3) switching to a higher viscosity oil (5-40 rotella), and 4) had the ecm programed for a slightly higher idle.

Buuuuut…. I have 260k miles.",Hummer
"Center differential

You're mixing carrier bearing up with the part that is actually on the rig

Hopefully that helps you find it otherwise you can search junkyards across America on car-part.com. that's where I'd look.",Hummer
"I’ve got an 03 H2 197k miles, frames great just a little surface rust I need to take care of i daily drive it, they are not good on gas keep that in mind but they’re great vehicles bought mine for 10k and put 5k in it, radio, rims, tires, brakes, tune up and some cosmetic stuff I regret nothing definitely my favorite vehicle I’ve ever owned",Hummer
"Buy an H2, I love mine!!",Hummer
"Negotiate , never take the first price. Try pointing out small imperfections that aren’t a big deal like any trim that is sun faded/burned",Hummer
"its going to be a lot harder on a 06, I believe 08? and newer had redesigned firewalls and maybe some other components to fit the V8, if you live near nebraska I'll gladly sell you a V8 and 4l60e from a 08 alpha",Hummer
i spent 6 hours searching and i ended up with this result,Hummer
I’m sell my 04 SUT for the same price with 212k miles,Hummer
"Thanks, I’ll see if NY state is the same",Hummer

It’s probably the blower motor or it has to do something with the blower motor resistor these usually fail most of the when you set it on low air speed longer it happens all the time on colorados canyons I-series from Isuzu and this well cut the wire that was bunt a inches away from burnt and rewiring the connection that goes into and place it back once after it’s finished replaced newly,Hummer
Haven't seen that before,Hummer
Just barely but yes.,Hummer
What were they like for a daily?  What were the problems you may have encountered or believe you would encounter with it?,Hummer
Ya I’ll dm it to u if I can bc I also use this reddit account for school and I don’t want people linking my account to me :D,Hummer

"Yeah, it's crazy.  In Hawaii, the Hyundai dealers charge ~$5k markups.  The Toyota dealers throughout the island are the only ones who only charge MSRP.  It's crazy seeing people get Hyundai anyway.  I'm pretty sure they've haggled for a lower or no markup, but still.  The markups that these Hyundai dealers charge make their cars more expensive than a Toyota.",Hummer
"Yup. Nice. I’m envious. A similar one was for sale up my way for $CAD 27,000.",Hummer
Oh maybe cause they’re sticking out further and are a much bigger wheel is what’s confusing me,Hummer
"Ohh Okay I didn’t know that, thats good to know though. I will at least know what they’re talking about next time.",Hummer
"Like they said, vapor canister vent valve. Easy fix and I don't think I paid more than $25 for the part on Amazon",Hummer

"My H2 has yet but had other cars leak. Clean the drains, tighten all the bolt and clean their seals.",Hummer
Did you buy it from a dealership? If so complain to them to find where the key is. If you bought it from a private seller ask him where it is or where you can get it. Guaranteed if it's a private seller he has it still,Hummer
Company in California does it costly though predictor motors I believe,Hummer
"lol Jesus that’s one hell of an answer. Your name wouldn’t happen to be motor trend would it? 

Thanks!!",Hummer
5k for a rebuild or a new transmission altogether?,Hummer
Looks great! Would love to have you check out my Frog post on the Hummer Forum. Trying to start a new thing with Hummer drivers and would love more input!,Hummer
"Parts for the engine and running gear are easy to get ,but trying to get body or interior parts is damn near impossible  and if you can find them  they are outrageous. I have owned my 04 since 2018  with zero major issues only little things like electric  door locks  going out and a couple of window motors but  it is a 20 year old vehicle,  so wear and tear is expected. 

Make sure to keep your transmission and transfer case  fluid changed and I would recommend using synthetic oil for the front and rear diffs . Cold air intake and a program will help your mileage, you can get a used programmer off eBay for 30-60 bucks , after doing the synthetic oil , cold air and programming I can average 13.5  hwy  at 75 mph it is only about 2-3 mpg more than stock  but every little bit  makes a difference . They are great trucks  and you will enjoy it",Hummer
thank you for the help,Hummer
Hope you get the opportunity to get your own one day man!,Hummer

"I suggest the lift keys for the front, takes the stress off the torsion bars when doing just a stock key crank up lift, keeps the ride more supple.

Definitely didn’t get pressed on far enough then.,Hummer
Not normal. I have an 08 that's rock steady. It's gotta be tires or suspension.,Hummer

"If 7 ft tall you will have cut the support out behind the driver seat and rebolt the seat. I'm 6'4"" and I own humvee and my knees touch the dash. They are super cool trucks just make sure you buy one with top and doors cuz sourcing doors and top is pain the ass can cost up to 10k + 1k in shipping. You can also try Govplanet auction you could get lucky get one with all the stuff for under 15k but you will have figur out how to street legal it in your state. You want to aim for 6.5 L with 4 speed transmission so the one with Park gear.",Hummer

"Those look super, I’m gonna save this post",Hummer
"You are driving a clapped-out one with worn driveline/suspension/tires.

Check:

\-Balanced and round tires.

\-Round/balanced wheels/ be aware of funky ones with weird offsets or require adapters to fit.

\-Bushings/shocks/airbags/ball joints/tie rods for wear.

\-Worn steering components.

With non-worn components, you should be able to drive up to the legal limit with no vibration, and up to 100 mph with no issues.

Stuff wears out, if you are buying a 15-20+ year old truck and the previous owners never maintained it this is what happens. 

Get a pre-purchase inspection and an estimate to fix and deduct that off the asking price, otherwise look for a better condition used model. 

A lot of people want to ""ball"" with the Hummers but can't afford to maintain them.",Hummer

"Thank you so much! Yeah I've been reading some mixed things on the magnaflow. Did you also change the cats, and if so were they also from American Racing Headers?

"Yes! I feel bad neglecting my H2 but i rarely drive it now because of the HEV, just collects dust in the driveway.",Hummer
"Honestly at 16 i genuinely do not recommend you to get a hummer. Get a tacoma or something because no matter how experienced you might feel, a 6.4L v8 is going to be overkill for your age. My dad’s gets 10 mpg, and only gets like a 280 mile range. Gas is expensive and hummers are not known to be the most reliable trucks on the market. If you want something fast, a hummer isn’t the car to go fast in. And again, at 16 i don’t think a fast car is really the best option.",Hummer

"Yes the 35s are a bit stiffer  than the 37s but the loss in maneuverability just wasn’t worth it.  I ran 33s for a while and that was a very rough ride!

"I have an 06 i5 and have put over 100k miles myself on it, it has about 170k miles and honestly I've had zero engine issues.  Oil pressure sensor a year ago, $12 fix. 

I've needed new wheel hubs and ball joints, but with mileage and where I drive, it's to be expected.

Sweet!,Hummer
Not lowered just stock height.  I put the largest tire on there I could without a lift.,Hummer
"Please use an extra safety jack with the pump jack and not just a pump jack to support next time, ask me how I know!",Hummer
The i5’s are known to have warped heads but the newer years didn’t have this problem as much. As long as you don’t have gigantic mud tires on it’ll perform fine. 😊 Enjoy your new ride!,Hummer

"Most likely because its a slant cut casting on the valve body and they don't wanna rebuild it just buy new, and no new ones are available. Quality rebuilt ones however are.

"Also check your fluid level, parked with engine running on level ground, truck fully warmed up, run through the gears without moving, then check the dipstick. You could get lucky and just have low fluid. After that, disconnect the black ground wire from your battery for an hour while you do whatever. That'll do a computer reset basically. 

These are not for sure fixes at all, but it's better than not trying it. Hope you get lucky!",Hummer

Ac, water pump, power steering,  and the intake all need to be specific ones it looked like with a couple other small details

Stock wheels and stock skidplate would look nice.,Hummer
Don’t look at the thousands upon thousands of diesels out there then.  Most of them are now pushing 100k and some trim levels are over it.  So not a huge difference in price when you consider what you save on fuel when you charge at home.,Hummer

What wheel tire combo is that?,Hummer
Word 👍,Hummer
"Either the bushing failed, became unseated or the wrong bushing. It’s safe to drive home as long as theres no damage, but you are riding on the frame and chafing that shackle. Over time it will wear through. 

If a new bushing will sit but not super secure, this will happen again. But you can add a tack weld or two to keep it in place.",Hummer
What other things?,Hummer
That seems a bit high in price. We just bought an 09 with 100k for $8k and it looks exactly like this.,Hummer
I'd try to sell as is and if you go a couple months or so with no luck consider putting a new transmission in and selling it with that as a perk of the car or part it out.,Hummer

"Really nice rig! I have the baby Hummer (H3), but I would suggest considering the ride quality/comfort if you are thinking of a lift. My rear end turned really stiff after my lift.

no worries  man . I would not so far as to get the new rings because that is so deep into the engine you might as well rebuild it .  A super charger is a good idea  just keep the boost pretty low and you will be fine. Super chargers are very pricey  the hummer ones are about 5k .,Hummer

"Regarding value, I think H2s are nearly fully depreciated at this point. The problem with owning them long term is that parts are getting scarce (most parts are GM parts bin parts but there are a few that are specific to the H2), especially interior bits.

I considered an SUT when I bought my SUV. I chose the SUV over the SUT for, strangely, utility. The SUT bed is fairly small and unenclosed. I like being able to pack stuff in the back of my SUV and having it be covered and secured. Also, my dogs like riding in the back of my SUV better than in the bed of an SUT.",Hummer

"Physics.

A H1 / HMMWV will have about 8"" of suspension travel, the rims aren't the correct specifications for that application since they stick out past the bodywork/hood a few inches.

Under full suspension compression, those tires/wheels are going to hit the edge of the hood, force it up to bend, damaging the dogbones that hold the hood down, cracking the hood in places, and ... if at the right angle shove it into the a-pillar scraping the paint there on the body. Not to mention possible rear fender damage on the aluminum panels.

It'll add up quick.

Hood is averaging $1500, for a HMMWV replacement, you need fill/drill holes to match a H1, then paint/prep it, an the labor associated to transfer all the brackets, vents, seals, trim pieces, etc its a few grand repair for the sake of ... rimmmmzz.

A wheel/tire assembly with the correct specification will compress inside the fender and hood since there's a few inches of clearance inside the hood and rear fender.

That pretty much leaves you with very few options for wheels:

Hummer OEM, which is Hutchinson or Cepek GT/Hummer product wheels, military surplus, etc.

I think there's a few 8 lug dodge/gm wheels from 2500 series pickups that are fairly close but it's better to get the right wheel for the job.

Or you get a large enough body lift/suspenion lift where the tires will never ever touch under full compression, that's another route, I've seen some Hummers up in Iceland/Norway do that with the big balloon tires.

That sema truck doesn't have enough lift for that wheel/tire combo.",Hummer

"So disappointing because I’ve been waiting for that car for 2+ years, but people must be paying that if they’re charging for it.",Hummer
"I watched that one as well and they have a different engine. However I FINALLY found it and replaced. Ours has a bizarre plastic that covers it. I had to get a plumbing camera scope to locate. 

It’s bizarre where it is placed. Luckily I have small hands as it’s a really tight fit.

Thanks for your help though. So I got a video of replacing it from the invisible spot. lol I’ll post hopefully it can help others in the future",Hummer
I’d walk away simply because of the age. I’d find a “newer” one in the 08-09 range. Simply for the better interior and engine. The plastics compared to the older models is night and day,Hummer
"Neither. Neither is a good substitute for a truck whe n needed. Both have longer wheel bases then their non truck counterparts which negates the off-road portion of what they were built for in the first place.

"Dude I bought mine with just 40k more miles in perfect condition for 9k. That was 2 years ago when used car prices were higher.  

I wouldn't spend $20k on an H3 at all.  Maybe an Alpha but even then, probably not.

"This is exactly the response that saves idiots like me from LOTS of pain. I'm already in pain,  trying to patch it up with some kind of material distraction. I've had dozens of bad vehicle experiences, where my enthusiast nature and mechanical ability or lack thereof creates problems.

 The latest: . Im around 30k deep over 10 years on my 6.5 truck and its sitting with blown headgaskets along with 3 other gmt400 trucks, 4 parts engines with basically no good parts in them once opened up and scattered, ruining my garage. I think I would throw away somewhere in the neighborhood of 40k if I just scrapped all 4 of them, all the engines and all the spare parts, filters, etc. Obviously I'm not upper class or very smart.

So all of your specific, vivid advice does not fall on deaf ears, and really is the advice that I'm taking at this point. I don't have the resources or time to deal with the sort of problems you're talking about. Definitely embodies the ""mo money mo problems"" trope. 

One of the things I heard recently and mirrors something you said. The offroading club no longer is clearing trails for full sized trucks mostly side by side utvs. A buggy with truck axles even is too big to fit on the trails and is having a tough time. Fullsized trucks are so damaged by trees they have to climb out a window after wheeling  because the door is smashed shut. A HMMWV wouldn't make it past the first obstacle.

"WD40 Fitting lol I can’t touch my H1 without getting grease on me.  

Some thoughts on this plan.  These trucks come a few ways.  Mil surplus, used civilian, and aftermarket built up/restored.  If you are not buying one that’s been recently refurbished it’s going to need a lot of wrenching before it’s ready to go on road, more off, road and even more to be an overlander.  They are expensive to fix and while they are generally simple they have a “hummer tax” added to all parts.  I suggest you get good at doing the work yourself so you can get home when you break down.  I’ve owned a 97.5 H1 wagon for 5 years and rebuilt most of it myself.  I’ve invested over $45k+ in parts and tools to date above the cost of the vehicle.  Just to get it back to running driving, not over landing. 


Suggestion.  If you still want one look for an ambulance box Humvee.  It’s 2 doors but gives you the hard top with room to design a living space.",Hummer

"Wow! I have done research over the years, and this post is basically all the hard to find, good to know stuff that you can possibly want to know all. Including the 6.5 stuff that's often incorrect. I hope it was some kind of copy-paste, so you didn't have to type it out.

If not, it should be some sort of sticky!!! Thanks for entertaining the dreams of a poor.

I was hoping to spend as little as possible ~$15k? for an od 6.5 with a top/doors) for a fun toy to drive 5 - 6k a year for work and play, with little chance of losing a bunch if I need to sell. Since I had a kid, I'm not as interested in a Corvette or that sort of stuff.
Road legal farm implement with cool factor basically. But by the sound of it, a road legal example is just  way too costly, especially if the job is is too involved for my expectations. I'm a capable mechanic but also a busy business person. It would break and sit. I have a dump truck that needs an engine for a year, and my 6.5 needs head gaskets (likely an engine due to inevitable cracks) for two years.

"I was loading my 12x6 trailer wiht lumber in the Lowe's near me. There is some type of hybrid, maybe a VW also in the loading area. An older guyopens the back and places two very small boards in it. Proceeds to walk over to me and asks me what I spent on gas on ""that thing"". Then tells me, quite smugly that his electric car just had to be plugged in and left over night.

I was fucking flabbergasted. Asked him what he could tow with his little toy. Told him to fuck off. 

I am not a small guy, alot of people tell me I am too intense, this guy had some serious chutzpa to approach me. He was lucky that I was in a really good mood. Quite frankly, so was I. 

Weve had people throw us thumbs down on the road, people cut us off, people have dinged the doors... Its endless. Cannot wait to be out of this truck, we don't ned its tow capacity any longer so we are letting it go. It is also starting to break, alot.",Hummer

The problem I’ve experienced with the transmission for my H2 is that the components of the stock transmission are just not equipped to fully handle all that power and weight. So getting the components inside reinforced whenever it was rebuilt was a game changer.,Hummer

"You can adjust to 23.5” without issues, above that you’ll have increased wear and tear. 

The “spring” your feeling is the additional preload of the bar to achieve the height. Which is normal. You’ll also notice the additional brake drive due to the increased distance between the bump stop and control arm. They make extended bump stops for this if you feel the need for it. Also, not sure what shocks you have but bilstein 5100’s would probably help.",Hummer
"\[Short version, if you owned a 6.5 diesel for a while and are fairly handy and .. got land/ranch to run it on, you should be fine\]

Buy an H1 first, get something in the 40-50k range, maintain it and drive the hell out of it and get a feel if it's for you, if not, you can recoup the money since H1's will hold/appreciate in value and they can be easy to resell, certainly compared to a HMMWV.

Most of the happy HMMWV owners I know and wheel with were either H1 owners first, or were into Military vehicle collecting/restoration beforehand so they know all the ups and downs of everything.

I'll also say this, there's no such thing as a cheap Hummer/HMMWV in these cases.

It sounds like you got 6.5 diesel experience, and a farm/ranch with land,  a hmmwv makes a great farm truck for doing shit around the ranch, since the ride quality is basically a street-legal farm implement.

&#x200B;

H1 advantages over HMMWV:

\-Better creature comforts, the further you get along in model year the better the vehicle. Better HVAC, better soundproofing, etc. Every year AM General worked in a lot of improvements.

\-Better sound insulation and highway drivable, you won't go deaf going down the interstate \[depending on model year\].

\-The trucks come with doors and decent seats and an interior.

\-Simple to Buy / Sell / Insure / Register/ Input/Export. It's a truck, with a 17 digit conforming vin that meets Federal Motor Vehicle regulations and emissions standards.  In comparison, some states outright ban registration of HMMWVS basically leaving it a trailer queen/ATV at that point. Laws are changing in some states and one moment you have a street-legal truck, and the next minute you don't.

\-On the last point, easy to finance, it's a normal classic car, harder to get money for a HMMWV since that'll fall under a more expensive ""lifestyle"" loan.

\-Keeps water out. Good luck keeping the elements out of a slant back \[hmmwv\].

\-12v electrical system, pretty standard automotive system with gm weatherpak connectors.

\-Parts intercompatibility between the HMMWV to an extent. Want to swap in a rhino tire carrier kit? Just bolt it on. Lots of frame/chassis parts are interchangeable.

\-Better seatbelts, brakes, collapsible steering column, etc. These civilian trucks had to meet higher safety standards than the military ones. 

&#x200B;

HMMWV Advantages over HMMWV:

\-Lower cost of entry\[in theory\] , you can get a project truck for a few grand from govplanet. Bad news is no doors, shit seats, and missing parts and that $5000 surplus truck quickly becomes $20,000. Might be better to find an already tagged truck that has doors/seat upgrades in the 15k-20k range and go from there.

The key thing to avoid is dumping 20-40k into a hmmwv to make it into a ""hummer"" . If you keep things military spec and accurate for the build then you can resell to picky military vehicle collectors.

\-Lots of relatively plug and play surplus parts out there.

\-HMMWV Turbodiesels at this point \[2005+\] are the more bulletproof GEP optimizer casting verses the crack prone H1 turbos.... H1's were guinea pigs for the 6.5 turbos in the late 90's early 00's lots of #8 cracks, mine did this and I wound up replacing my engine with a HMMWV longblock cast in 2016.

&#x200B;

Downsides of both:

\-shocks/springs wear out fairly often for oem trucks. First thing I did was get the Cepek H1 custom shocks with the lifetime warranty. I swap out springs every few years.

\-cramped/leg room. The first thing AM General did with the H1 line was remove the B pillar cross member behind the driver and passenger front seats, that added a few inches. The H1 didn't require roof reconfiguration like the HMMWV so that allowed for a bit more interior room verses the military version.

\-Wheel/tire assemblies. If you want to stick to the dual beadlock/runflat it's a pain and expensive. $200/labor \[2 hours or so\] per wheel assembly to swap/balance tires. Hard to secure 16.5"" size on the military trucks although they are adopting a 17"" wheel finally starting with the HMMWV Winter tire kit this year which is a new 2 piece 17"" wheel with a BF Goodrich AT KO2 tire. Otherwise you are stuck with $800 goodyear MT variants or surplus tires. 17"" H1 wheels can be had at a reasonable price for 1 piece wheels, but once you get to 2 piece 17/18"" wheels they get expensive quick, 2 piece ""alpha"" wheels go for $4000-6000 used.

\-Doors are outrageously expensive now. Back when original hummers were in production and hmmwv's were not widely available at all ... you could get new steel full doors for $400.00 and military x doors were 100-200$ because no one wanted them. Those days are over. The last good deal I saw for hummer doors was $4500 for a set of 4 complete doors reduced from $9000 and $2400 for 4x used X composite hmmwv doors. Crazy.

\-Hard to find good people to work on them with proper knowledge not to bubba things up and cause enough issues where you get caught sending trucks shop to shop to fix the previous shops mistakes.

\-Because of the above situation, it's not uncommon to ship your truck to the regional ""h1/hmmwv guru"" of a particular region. A lot of  local shops won't touch these.

\-Cooling sucks at highway speeds. you got to drive to the temperature gauge. The geared fan drive didn't really fix the problem 100%. It's really easy to overheat these trucks in the south/southwest if you aren't mindful. It's at the point with my 1998 HMCO I drive on I-40 verses I-10 crossing the country because the 15-20 degree difference in ambient temperature means the difference in driving at 65 mph with dual AC on verses driving at 55mph with A/C off in the summer.

\- Lots of off-roading means pitman/idler arms and ball joints are common maintenance/replacement items verses a mall crawler.

&#x200B;

General Advice:

\-Beware engine conversions. Duramax/cummins conversions aren't plug and play and most of those conversions are fucked up and need debugging \[I can go on for hours about this\]. Own the truck for a while first and enjoy it for what it is.

\-I thought about getting a duramax conversion myself but its cheaper in time/money to simply just sell my truck and buy an Alpha \[2006 Duramax H1\] or simply buy a new 250/2500 series tow rig and just pull my Hummer around with it on long trips :)

\-Mileage shouldn't be a concern with these. If it is, go buy a kia. :) My trucks lifetime combined mileage with 153,000 miles of driving averages around 13 mpg.

Any more questions just ask...",Hummer
The engine and the interior is precisely why I’m only going for the 08-09 year. I hate how much plastic is inside the cabin. Absolutely ridiculous for a “luxury” trim of the Hummer brand. The 08-09 years are the only ones that can really be called luxury,Hummer

"I bought a 03 H2 Hummer in Oct of last year. These trucks are getting old and will definitely need bushings all over the place, especially the front diff carrier bushings(bottom carrier bushing like to fail and it's not supposed to replaceable, some aftermarket press in stuff or buy the complete carrier for $700 from GM), seals in the intake are a must if showing signs of blow out near heads, knock sensors can be a pain, P0300 random misfire code can be an elusive fix, watch using modern Chinese Bosch garbage because of the DIS IGNITION, air compressor can fail and a whole host of other crap! But, these trucks if taken care of by the previous owners will take you anywhere you would want to go! They're awesome 4X4's and if you buy anything new with the same features would cost you a fortune! The transmission in a '03  will fail sometime after 100k because it's under built. When replacing the tranny, convert your rebuild to the 4L75E FROM THE 4L60E by replacing the torque converter to a 300mm and a tail piece from the 4L75E. Probably some other parts and planetary gears too. DO NOT ADD A BUNCH OF HP! Unless you build your truck right! If you can find one without rust all over the frame, and it looks garaged, go for it. If it's been sitting for years and everything is dry rotted, pass. If you do buy a sitter? Get ready to rebuild her seals, tranny, front diff, U-joints and a lot more. Depends what you're looking for. Me, I was looking for the scary description I gave above. These trucks are not complicated and for the most part, easy to work on. I love my H2 more than I would if I bought one already built or taken care of. If you're mechanically inclined and have the money, go for it. Parts are quite cheap due to most being from a 2500 series truck in the front to mid section and a 1500 rear end. The 4 wheel drive system on the H2 is birg warner and is for the most part, tough except the plastic fork in the transfer case. They're an investment and a toy, but I love it more than my new gmc2500 4X4 with a lift. So much fun! As for fuel mileage, it's not about the miles per gallon, it's smiles per gallon!!!

I'd start with complaining to them enough about how it's their fault for not telling you and having a key and they might at a minimum try to find where you can get one. If they don't do that I guess ask the shop for their recommendation. Maybe you can buy another one online but I'm not positive. If you do need to find what wheels they are go to custom offsets and search by your wheel size and the brand XD and you should find them quick,Hummer
"The H2 and 3 are cool vehicles, and I have always liked them, but they're just expensive enough to be unattainable. They're also average enough where it doesn't really scratch the ""itch.""

"The two before me already made the case pretty clearly (they would have convinced me if I didn't already know better), so I'll just follow up with an anecdote:  Several years back I had an opportunity to get a milsurp HMMWV for what would be considered chump-change compared to what they're going for today.  It was the older, shittier GM diesel but didn't need what I thought at the time to be a lot of work--when you're younger, you tend to be more forgiving and idealistic about these things.  Everyone I knew who was in one of these things professionally said ""NO, do not get one"" but I of course was determined to find out the hard way, or would have if it hadn't sold beforehand.

""Mil-Spec"" is a really cool term for ""supplied by the lowest bidder"".  Since the Pentagon wants their toys to survive everything and your kid's birthday party, that results in some incongruous design decisions; witness the Iraq War fiasco with everyone suddenly acting surprised that Humvees don't handle explosives quite as well as recruiting videos would have you believe.  They were designed to be a replacement for the military Jeep that would carry bigger guns.  The seats are designed so that soldiers and Marines wearing 80 lbs of gear strapped to them could actually sit down.  Not comfortably, necessarily, but enough that you could actually drive the vehicle.  You could drive it anywhere too, which is good because a lot of roads aren't big enough, and in many states the right lane of the interstate might still be too fast.  It had that in common with its M-38 predecessors as well as the spartan accommodations that could be cleaned out with a garden hose.  That came in especially handy in the Middle East where on some very tragic occasions, they needed more than sand cleaned out of them.  (I wish that was more benign than it sounded but I lost a good friend to that type of thing)

Seriously, Humvees are like Italian sports cars:  Lots of fun as long as it belongs to someone else.  I have nothing against Italian sports cars (having been around when they were considerably more difficult to drive than they are today); if it's worth the tradeoffs, by all means get one, but be aware that there *are* tradeoffs.",Hummer

"There are a few other differences with the mutant variant behind the Hummer I5 (bellhousing, oil pump, converter, input shaft, possibly TCM) but what I've been hearing generally:

- The shop hears horror stories/the owner's brother's friend's dad's brother in law had to do it and said it was a PITA

- They see the billable that the dealership lists and nope out

I5-specific 4L60e problems have gotten so absurd that In some cases I've found it was actually cheaper--not by a lot, but some--to just swap in a 5.3 since they're a dime a dozen and the 4L60e's behind them are normal.  Of course that assumes you're doing all or most of the work yourself (or know someone trustworthy) so that probably won't help OP; it just goes to show how ridiculous the situation is.

"I think the Vortech kit was a one-off for a SEMA show '08 IIRC but don't quote me.  A couple of Australian outfits did something with the Whipple twin-screw but across the board no one could fab an intake manifold consistently enough to justify the cost.

There were some threatening to produce...something...if they could get enough buyers (Spoiler alert:  They didn't) but I'm pretty sure those were all vaporware.  I have seen a few show trucks--again, Colo/Canyons--with blowers but more commonly of the turbo variety and almost always custom-made with fabrication, no kits to be found.

Not gonna lie, the very idea of forced induction on this misbegotten milk-truck engine makes my eye twitch.  I rarely say this but I've found myself saying it more over time:  You'd probably be better off just doing a V8 swap.",Hummer

"Looks great! Pro tip- take a heat gun to your A pillar plastics and they’ll turn black like new again. Careful how close you get, you’ll find the sweet spot.

"I have been thinking about frogs and at first thought it isn’t really representative of the hummer - like more army, the moon etc but I couldn’t think of anything else.

"It's weird, how things change over time as an H1/Hummer owner.

Decades ago, it was the Hummer curse. Same questions, what mileage, how much does it cost, is it bulletproof, can it drive underwater,etc. Over and over.

After the H2/H3 came out.

""Oh a real hummer, not like those fake ones"" \[their words not mine\]

Today?

""Not a real hummer, I'm talking about the military ones"" which is funny given the history.

""I didn't know they made civilian ones! \[H1's/Commerial Hummers\]""

From veterans:

Love/hate: ""Those things are the biggest pieces of shit"" or "" I love those trucks"" no inbetween.

Yeah, I wouldn't want to be riding down the highway in a government maintained m998/1038/etc with the noise,etc.

From wierdos:

This was at a Terribles station in Kingman Az, had some guy strike up a conversation when fueling up and just straight up making up shit.

""I worked on those, but the real ones made out of titanium in the factory in Tennesee..., etc""

Hummers/HMMWV's were only made in South Bend, In and out of aluminum/steel.

I just nod my head and go ""cool.""

"That’s kind of a difficult question to answer to be honest. There are too many variables in the condition and the care or neglect the previous owners may have took with the vehicle that might suddenly spring up.

To give you a rough idea of my experience, I put around 3-5k into mine in the first 6 months of ownership to get it well sorted. That was mostly just to address the more common issues with the vehicle.

It shares some parts with other GM vehicles, but there are many parts specific to only the H2 and they can be costly since they aren’t as common to come by. Other things that weren’t a common issue in the past  like the air suspension or the availability of tires in the stock rim size are slowly becoming more common issues of ownership to consider as the vehicle continues to age.",Hummer

The lateral accelerometer and yaw rate is most likely the yaw sensor located under the carpet underneath the drivers seat. Take the seat out and roll the carpet back and you’ll find it. It’s a silver box bolted to the floor. Common to go out as they get wet if the sunroof leaks. Which is hella common.,Hummer
"$3500 is about going rate for a 3.7 that hasn't been beaten to within an inch of its life.  The billable time on that engine install is a little over 12 hours not counting swapping over good parts from the original engine (intake, alternator, power steering etc) so figure 13.5 hours at whatever the shop rate is (average should be about $115/hr depending on where you are).  If replacing the engine is fiscally doable--not ""pleasant"", but doable--I would suggest shopping around for a reputable/trustworthy indie shop to do the work.

Sunk-cost fallacy doesn't really apply here; you've already replaced the trans and done a bunch of other work in less than a year's time.  That's a bit too much to throw away IMO.  If the engine you end up with is reliable enough to survive a warranty period (same for the trans and all the other hard parts), just go the rest of the way.  You already have this vehicle; there's not a lot to be gained by spending the same amount of money on another vehicle that someone may have gotten rid of for the same reason.",Hummer

"2007 H3.  Most of the mechanical and operating parts are not an issue as they're fairly generic across GMC.  Any item I've had to fix has been available through GMC or 3rd party shops.  When we purchased it, they'd hit a deer and we had to replace the grill and one of the side mirrors - both available at reasonable prices. 

On a bad note, I had the windshield replaced and the shop broke the plastic trim where the front pillar locks into the roof trim.  The front pillar is available as it's a common replacement item due to weathering but that trim part on the roof is no longer available and the junk yards had only similarly broken parts.

Even the engine and transmission - unless you completely explode them, you can rebuild with a good machine shop.  Even so, I've seen them for sale at junk yards as I'm looking for other parts.

In short, you'd be able to keep it going unless you have an accident and then all bets off.  Body panels and such aren't available by what I've seen.",Hummer
"For the year & mileage be prepared to replace or upgrade the parts. I have an 05 & replaced the tranny at 203k, suspension, tie rods, bearings & now the power steering unit.

I dont intend to get rid of mine until I reach that million mile mark. GM still has it where when you reach the million miles club. They give you a new version of the model.

"100% do it. They are modular, basically Legos. You can convert two man cargo or troop carriers to a four man, vice versa, add whatever top, roof, box, or configuration you want. If you get one that's running mechanically fine and are just doing cosmetics and mods, you'll love it. There are technical manuals (TM) for every single nut and bolt, like AllData or Hanes manual. There is TM for turning the engine on and off.

The best part is since they're not cars with nice paint jobs and are usually beat on, nothing needs to be done professionally on them to meet some non-existent standard. Want to try your hand at spraying paint? Go for it! Want to bed liner the whole truck with a DIY kit that you've never done before. Do it. 

Working on them mechanically isn't hard. I'm not sure where the misconception about them being mechanically nightmares and very expensive to work on comes from. The drivetrain is basically the same drivetrain out of an older diesel GM truck. A power steering pump, alternator, radiator, whatever are normal priced for a vehicle of this type. 

They're perfectly fine as long as you understand it's a toy vehicle and akin to owning a Jeep Wrangler with no doors or top, all the time. I say that because unless you have deep pockets, you're not going to have an AC unit, and can't afford to add it and then add a hard top and hard doors.

"There are some parts that are more specialty that you'll have a hard time finding but really you just need to know where to look. For example, I changed the rear hatch actuator on my 2005 H2 earlier this year. When you look it up online it was hundreds of dollars, and every parts store I called said they didn't even have it in their system (Advance Auto, O'Reillys, AutoZone) so I was worried I'd be stuck waiting on a rock auto order or spending a couple hundred bucks on the part. I decided to try a different approach and see what other gm models from 2005 had a rear hatch actuator, and saw that the Tahoe and Cadillac did as well. I quickly cross-referenced the part numbers and sure enough they were the same. A 5 minute drive to advance Auto and 45 bucks later and problem was solved. So while the H2 does have some specialty parts, don't be scared into thinking you'll never be able to replace them if something goes wrong, almost every part other than trim pieces are interchangeable with other models and the trim pieces can often be repaired with a plastic welder or you can find a replacement online for a decent price with a little digging.

Great name too 😁",Hummer
Did you buy it?,Hummer
"I have an 07LUX. It does not matter how many miles it has, seals still age the same, parts degrade over time. Mine had 250k on it and I have rebuilt most of it, just dropped a new 6.2 crate into my this past summer. You can find most all parts as they have to be manufactured for 20+ years after the model is discontinued. 
They are not cheap to work on and they are a toy that is a labor of love. I love my toy and it turns heads every time I drive it. If you get it and want a list of items to start with, send me a message. Best of luck!",Hummer
Love the color,Hummer
🤔 surely not with the same mileage/condition,Hummer
I just like the car … I’m no fan of the new ones don’t like the look that’s all … also I do have my everyday car this one is just for enjoyment times to times but I think I’ll pass on this one and get a better offer with less mileage I don’t want the hedge so quick 😂,Hummer
I saw a H2SUT the other day and was damn jealous for a second.,Hummer
"‘07 H2 SUT here on 37’s with 6.0 and 221k miles. Will cruise at 80 no problem. It will go 90-95+ but haven’t pushed her to find out max top end. Any shaking/wobbling could have several factors: out of balance tires, alignment, shocks, tie rods, etc.",Hummer
"I don't see why they would care its a 4L60E pretty standard GM stuff. Its a Hummer specific valve body, and trans pan, that's really the only difference from a standard 4L60E.

Cottmans- (804) 272-1911

"He said the price included the difficulty of replacing the engine bc it was ""stuck"" to the transmission and would be hard to separate.",Hummer
"Beside the bed size, what is the difference between the H2 SUT and the H3T?",Hummer

How does the whole car look with the new wheels? And what size rim and tires.. I hate how big the wheel well is on the rear of my H3 …thanks!,Hummer
Saw it at a car show. not impressed.,Hummer
"90mph is right up near its top speed so technically it could. But it would definitely struggle to get up to that speed. I drive my H3 on the highway everyday and getting up to 75mph is no issue, it's takes longer than a normal car to get there but not really much longer",Hummer
100% recommend a mechanical gauge if anyone is getting low oil warnings because 1. Of all the things to do on these this is actually an easy job and 2. That's the only way to be certain anyway,Hummer
How has your H3 held up as for reliability? Is yours the 5.3 or the inline 5? I like the idea of the longer bed which is why I am leaning more toward the H3T as opposed to the H3 or H2 SUT.,Hummer
Love my Sut bought it with a blow up engine and a leaking transmission for cheap with 220k was negligent maintenance. I usually see them up in the 320k before have problems with normal maintenance. Got a 100k engine from a Silverado SS and send the transmission to  get rebuilt with upgraded clutch’s. Looking to get another 200k. But parts that are specific to hummers are getting harder to find.,Hummer
"Look under a 2008 2500 suburban or Silverado. The rears look similar, but you’ll have to purchase and compare to be sure. 

At the end of the day if it’s close in length and fits in the diameter of the hole you can make it work.",Hummer

E bay Amazon A1 auto parts junk yards join hummer forum.Parts are becoming hard to find.,Hummer
"I owned a HMMWV for 5 years. I daily drove it as much as I could. My commute is very short, 3 miles and I have other cars so it was possible for me to own one. Mine was a M1026(?), 6.5L with LED lights and the hydraulically powered winch. It had 4 X doors and a soft top. It might have been the newest civilian one I've ever seen. 

I'm a former mechanic and automotive Engineer, and there were times when I had to get really crafty to make that thing work. It was a ton of effort to keep it going. In the five years I owned it I only put about 8,000 miles on it. It only left me stranded someplace once, but it broke down at either my home or office where I had a spare vehicle at least ten times. 

Soon after buying it I realized that it would be impossible to find a mechanic that would work on it. Anybody in my area that was decent at working on weird vehicles was already busy working on high-dollar hot rods and that sort of thing. They don't want to mess with a cruddy, dirty, smelly HMMWV. I had to do it myself. I have a lift in my garage, which was needed. 

I spent about $1500 a year in parts keeping it going. Typical things were the glow plugs, glow plug module, steering parts (oh god, how many idler arms and ball joints I replaced). Rebuild kits for the hubs (they were constantly leaking), and other bullshit. Tires lasted about 4,000 miles. I never had any major failure like a motor, trans, or transfer case, so my costs were pretty low. 

The good news was that when I sold it I got slightly more than what I paid for it, so in the end it wasn't too expensive to own, about $1.50 per mile. You mention that you aren't a wealthy guy. I'm on the other end of the scale. It seems like it would be really tough to own a HMMWV without a lot of cash ready to get it back running. 

It was tough to insure. I could not get any real coverage on it, just the bare minimum stuff. It's weird driving a $30,000 vehicle that if you get in an accident you are going to just eat the cost. I didn't care much for that. I also didn't care for carrying my kids around in a vehicle that didn't have a single airbag. You are kidding yourself if you think these things are safe. Also, it was awful in the snow/ice. It was good in dirt and mud and good in deep, wet snow, but when the temps dropped and the roads became icy, the lack of ABS and high center of gravity made it a mess. At one point the brake bias valve failed and put too much brake pressure to the rear, I thought it was going to kill me. 

It was not, in any way, highway worthy. Even with frequent wheel alignment (I had to do them because NO ONE would touch it), you still are sawing at the wheel to keep it going straight. Even on secondary roads where you cruise 55 mph, it was two hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. You could never relax driving it. 

I don't remember mine being too roomy. I'm only 5'11"" and I don't think I had a lot of spare space and it was hard to see out of. Have you sat in one? 

Final thing: I live in a really fancy town and when I drove my kids to school in that HMMWV, especially when they were in elementary school, the place would go nuts. Kids loved that thing. That's pretty much the reason I kept it. 

We went off roading in it, and it was good off road, but too large to be the greatest. The SidexSides make you look stupid and the Jeep crowd had enough modifications to be better. 

Eventually though it was just a big pain in the butt and uncomfortable. I was happy when I sold it.",Hummer
You can  super charge one but you need to be careful  and keep the boost pretty low. The vortec 6.0 was not built for super charging or turbo charging and if you crank the boost up very high you can thrash your engine  since the piston rings were not cut for boost . If you want to get into it and redo the rings  you can get tons of power out of a 6.0,Hummer

"I am looking for bolt size and specs for the intermediate underbody shield for the hummer H1 (1998)  
A handful of years ago, the underbody shield was removed to make some repairs, but the shield was never replaced because there were a number of other repairs that were needed, which got stalled on due to tight money. A while ago the repairs got finished and I need to replace the underbody shield. The shield is quite a ways away at my parents place, and its accompanying bolts are missing. I've found torque specs, but I cannot find the bolt size, grade, or thread pitch for the bolts. Is anybody able in access to that information or able to take a quick peak for me? Would save me some lengthy trips to go out to my parents place to measure things and guessing in the dark.",Hummer
"Hey man sorry for the delay! I honestly have never measured my offset, when I got these rims and tires I didn't know much about these things but have since learned to do most things myself. So for your first question it is 315-70R17, they don't ride quite as nice as the ko2's to be honest but I love the look of them too much to part.

And (assuming I measured correctly) my offset is -19 mm which is part of where my leveling kit comes into play. I honestly think you could probably get away with -18 and have no concerns as it is only a little bit more wiggle room with the kit I have but you'll have to ask somebody with a bit more experience in that regard. Hope that helped and God bless!",Hummer

"What model Hummer?  You have 4-5+ different models depending if you include the HMMWV or not, etc. 

Generally speaking, if it's a H1/H2/H3, any parts shared with another platform are still available. 

H1 -> HMMWV

H2 -> GMT Platform vehicles like Tahoe/Suburban/Escalade from similar era.

H3 -> Colorado

Plus you have aftermarket and cross-reference parts from other makes. \[Eg. Hummer H1 steering Column from Ford, ABS controller from Wabco, switches from Eaton/Freightliner, Door handles from Jeep, etc.\].

The problem with this is the UNIQUE components to each model. 

Interior pieces from old Hummers are hard to find since they are out of production, your alternative is to find custom-fabricated pieces or repair/reupholster old pieces.

Generally, drivetrain/pieces share parts from other vehicles.

That being said, this is not a problem unique to Hummer. With the H1, and surplus HMMWV market, there is an aftermarket building replacement parts, however the costs can be extreme. A new hard door shell for an H1 used to cost $400 but can run $2000 for a factory shell with aftermarket ones running double that. 

So it goes to say, there's no such thing as a cheap hummer, if you buy one used buy the nicest condition one you can get your hands on.",Hummer
Same here. I ended up getting a H2 specific car cover and I just pay attention to forecasts.. keep it covered if there is more than 60% chance of rain. Not my daily driver so not that much of a problem..,Hummer
You can pretty easily buy winch mounts that insert into a 2” trailer hitch receiver and you’ll find that on your H2 there is a 2” receiver behind your front licence plate mount. I had to modify mine by drilling vertically through the winch mount because the pin drops into the front receiver through from the top of the bumper rather than horizontally like it would be on a rear trailer receiver.,Hummer

That hummer looks in great condition for the price too. One thing I adamantly advise is when you’re on your test drive see how the transmission feels when switching gears. If there’s any slippage or it drags out and sticks a little longer then it normally does to switch gears(Usually 1-4 are the problems if there are any) then I’d advise you to get a mechanical inspection done before ever purchasing.",Hummer

"It's the difference between it behaving like a heavy station wagon vs an suv/light truck

It's hard to do a timing job on a 3.7 and that's their biggest failure point. 

They're both good motors honestly but neither will blow you away,  the 5.3 is a great upgrade but it's reflected in the market and it doesn't mean the 5cly is BAD but it takes about $500 in just speciality tools to do the timing job, not including about 15 hours of shop labor so that ends up with many being mechanically totaled at that point, sometimes before 150,000 miles. 

The 3.7 is not bad just more support for the 5.3 and its arguably more reliable than the 5cyl 

The 5cyl is an engine they didn't have to make, they made a couple parts just to make it possible for the h3/ Colorado/ canyon. 

They easily could of sold just the 4 and 6 cyl version  and not offered the h3 with a 5cyl only the v8, but they had to do a couple things to make the v8 possible so GM had to compromise on a bunch of things for the H3 in all reality though.",Hummer

"I certainly would have it inspected for you by it. The prices sounds about in the range. Mine has been relatively trouble free for its life. I have a 2003 with similar miles.

"I have an 06. I had to deal with the common transmission selector issue where the switches can’t select different settings, low, high, locked etc. from lack of use. Mine unfortunately wasn’t the easy fix of servicing the contact points. I had a few oil leaks and my wiper motor was on its last legs which is also fairly common. The steering box and power steering also had to be addressed due to leaks and wear. Not common problems but somethings the previous owner had left unaddressed and I took care of before they became bigger issues

After I spent the money to have it sorted it runs well and has been a reliable vehicle for me. It’s just not necessarily cheap to fix depending on what is needed. 11.5 mpg and a 30+ gallon fuel tank adds up fast as well.

I haven’t had to deal with my tires/rims yet. I plan on just going up to 18 or 20 inch rims if I have to. I enjoy the stock ride quality as is and don’t off-road much where I would have a need for different keys, lift or 37” tires. 

Check the headliner for water damage because of the leaky running lights. Check for cracks on the door panels and interior trim. The plastic turns brittle the older it gets and are hard to find replacements. Check the rear hatch handle and interior panel. The rear hatch is extremely heavy and the handle and interior panel was a weak spot in their design. Check the power side mirrors and make sure they fold in. They all came from the factory with this feature. They are a pain to fix or replace.",Hummer

"I would say up to 1” would be fine with a standard key crank lift. Anything over that and your sacrificing ride quality (too stiff) and longevity of Parts.

There’s some sweeeeet deals in Japan.

It took me all of about a day to realize that I didn’t like driving the M1038 at all and I drove the 3500 for the rest of the deployment.  The thing was loud, seats suck, it’s really wide, suspension sucks, lacks power and did I mention loud.  The only redeeming factor was the thing was a beast off road and in the mud. I honestly spent most of the time messing around with the one I had and I used the 3500 for commuting and actual work.

Great choice!,Hummer
"[True Blue Motorsport](https://truebluemotorsport.com/) (Note:  I am not affiliated with this business in any way).  There's a thread on the H4O forum that's still being (sort of) updated despite being started back in 2015.  You can see that for yourself [here](https://hummer4x4offroad.com/forum/threads/6l80e-6spd-conversion.10376/) but the latest from the owner of the above business explained the technical aspects so, instead of wading through 14 pages of posts, here's the relevant stuff:

> a) 27 vs 32 spline output shafts vs input shafts. Yes, the 6LXX transmission all have 32 spline output shafts (like the 4L80). Hummer H3's have 27 spline input shafts. With GMT360 (Trailblazer) trucks we could offer a universal 32 spline input shaft (4WD) or our own in-house 32 spline input shaft (Torsen AWD) bc the input shafts were New Process units with separable internal components. H3's with the Borg Warner unit have a input shaft-planetary gearing cage unit. That plus a nominal amount of thickness on the wall of the input shaft makes a cost effective 32 spline option impossible. Further, this BW transfer case shares no relevant similarity with any other BW transfer case to scavenge parts from. Hence, the only option, similar to the GMT355s with they tiny Isuzu T120 unit required a 27 spline OUTput shaft for the 6L80. Like many, we did not want to take this approach, assuming that it would result in a weak point. We invested in custom HD (non-heat treated) output shafts being made at significant expense, only to discover that Rockwell strength of a cut down shaft was ever so slightly stronger than our the custom shafts. The process which GM uses to make their 6L80/90 output shafts produces an incredibly strong shaft well beyond the surface. Imagine that GM engineers and suppliers knows what they're doing vs the collective internet! So therefore we are more than comfortable offering this as an option. Particularly due to the torque multiplication work that the 4.03 gearing takes off of the shaft, let alone if you have a 4.10 transfer case. Just make sure you use graphite grease on the splines before installation!

-

> b) Transfer case adapter. So this was another issue we needed to nail down. In summary, our proprietary GMT360/355 based transmission-transfer case adapter, while wide enough to mate with the BW unit, proved to have conflicting bolt hole patterns with our pre-drilled units. Additionally, the depth of the adapter was forcing the V8 H3 customer to modify their front AND rear shafts' lengths and creating some questionable overlapping engagement of input/output shafts. Unacceptable for TBM. So we needed to re-redesign our adapters. They will not come with no holds, but only dimples to keep cost down and keep them universally applicable.

-

> c) Cooler lines. The 6LXX transmissions have cooler lines coming out of the bellhousing right about where V8 H3's cat's are located. Soooo, yeah, big problem. Fast forward. We now give our H3/GMT355 transmission systems a special angled connector to keep the lines running snuggly against the bellhousing and away from the cat.

-

> d) Low range engagement, VSS, Tach, etc. There is no loss of low range functionality with 08+E67 system and the TBM T42-Interface Module/Harness bc the integrity of the OEM CANbus network is maintained. HOWEVER, yes, if you use our standalone system (aka. PCS 2650, Zero Gravity, etc) there will be some, say ""added complexity"". Speedo off. Reverse lights, Etc. That said, yes, we use the PCS 2650 as the basis of our Omega6 system, but what makes the TBM Omega6 system more than just a more expensive 2650 kit is because we provide all of the components and support to make sure you vehicle operates with full functionality. Sometimes this means added parts, programming calibrations, etc that we learned and gained from tackling 6L80 swapped 4WD vehicles 18 years. Because we were also the first to put a 6L80 behind an Atlas engine (04 TB 4200 I6 lifted off road rig, metal bumpers, pulling camping trailer) while developing the H3 kit, we learned some more A-HA Gotchas. Short and sweet. Things like Atlas engine vs LS engine trucks have different front prop shaft lengths AND angles/clearance issues. VSS signals coming from different parts of the drivetrain give different signals some of which have limitations based on drivetrain ratios and tire size and the PCS doesn't always like them. The short and sweet? Truck is running perfectly with all issues addressed AND with tap shifting getting the same fuel economy as before but flying up hills and conquering rocks/trails like never before. And it chirps the 33""s!

-

> e) Torque converter stall speeds. It's one thing when you have a run of the mill big heavy 4WD truck with 2.xx low range and 3.73 axle ratios. It's another when you have compact heavy truck with big tires, 4.10 gears (at least stock), V8, AND optional 4.10 low range. We needed to expand our options for H3's because, as Levi reported, in 4.10 low range with a 6L80 4.03, the truck will almost pull through the brakes at idle. While this can be addressed with some ECM retuning of spark tables in his truck due to it being otherwise stock, that may not be an option for others. We've addressed that. V8's will need a different speed the Atlas motors depending on ratios and tire sizes. Moving on.

-

> f) Dipstick & tube. Levi reports that the OEM 6L80 GMT900 truck dipstick/tube that we originally provided fits with a bit of muscling to clear some H3 unique underhood features. Yes an aftermarket flexible one is available. We will be offering an option mini-dipstick that, like more modern vehicles will be accessible from under the truck. Makes installation WAY easier. Seals tight just like anything else. And you can still measure your fluid when you do services.

-

>g) Last but not least, reverse lights. So the H3's reverse light set up is based upon an older GM platform design that directly powers the Park Neutral Switch (PNP) and then subsequently the lights, review mirror came, etc. Unlike the newer generations which take their signal internally from the transmission's Internal Mode Switch (IMS) or CANbus language, this older set up means that once you remove the PNP from interaction with the transmission's manually rotated gear selection shaft, it's static/stuck in one circuit direction mode. Thankfully, from our work a few years back in being the first to swap a 6L80 into a new gen GTO (2004), we saw this type of system and created a new shaft lever and bracketry kit that relocates the 4L760's PNP to the 6L80. Now, your PNP engages the appropriate circuits just like the factory 4L60. V8 ALPHA NOTE: We are currently awaiting confirmation that this kit will still adequately clear the notoriously ill-placed catalytic converter. All other engine configurations are not a problem.

-

> So, all of that cleared up (hopefully), YES, we have comprehensive, fully functioning 6LXX swap systems for the full Hummer H3 line. Atlas or LS engine. CANbus E67 or older PCMs.

TL;DR As usual with the H3, nothing is as simple as it seems.  I laugh every time I hear someone refer to an H3 as an overbuilt 1st-gen Colorado.",Hummer
"I’ll save you the headache I have a 2008 h2 with the 6.2 and the 6l80. The gas mileage is exactly the same. Before supercharging it, I got about 9-10mpg city and 12 on the highway if I was really really trying. The 6.2 isn’t known for its fuel economy. Even the new trucks with the cylinder deactivation crap still only get about 13. You’d be downgrading in just about every category by going with the 6.2. The 6.0 is bulletproof and it’s the desirable motor by most ls swap enthusiasts. Not to mention the reliability of the 6l80 is questionable at best.",Hummer
"SAS is 100% the way to go but I bought new 31's and want to use them up before upsizing.

People think the 6.0L is just too slow, but it's a hummer so I wouldn't let that bother me. My H3 has the weaker engine and it's perfectly fine.",Hummer
Not too far fetched. Yukon XL Denali’s and Escalades optioned out are the same ballpark.,Hummer
"lol I got a house I can’t afford that thing. I’m driving a 22 year old h2.

"That’s actually my biggest worry. I’m new to hummers, normally drive F150. I test drove 3 hummers and they all started shaking and rattling as soon as you get above 75. I understand some of then might need a new transmission which I’m prepared to pay for, but mechanical issues aside a Hummer should go 80-85 with no problem right? Even if it takes a bit slower to get there",Hummer

"I have a 2003 H2. No shake at 70 or 80mph. There are many variables, tires, front end, etc…",Hummer
"One is built on a larger truck platform, so the H2 you are getting the V8, more interior space, etc. But the SUT has a comically tiny bed, it's not meant as a work truck, but its sufficient to stick some stuff in the back. I'd rather have the normal H2 wagon when it comes to that since the cargo area is enclosed.. also in my case \[California\] registration is cheaper since there's no extra truck weight fee \[H2 vs H2 SUT\].

H3T I don't like the interior space, but it's a usable truck bed, but I'd get the V8 Alpha version and pass on the I5.

If mileage is a concern, there's no real difference between any of those from a practical standpoint.",Hummer
Looks like the pulley wasn’t pressed on all the way. Was the pump recently replaced?  Looks new.,Hummer
Thank you! Glad to know people are so supportive. I somewhat agree with your tier list and I was only going to get an H3 if and only if it was an alpha and had that sweet sweet rear locker lol,Hummer

"Yes its a pretty good price for a 2009, those are the best ones in my opinion, more power and way better interior than the 03-07",Hummer
"Ok I wasn't 100% sure of your use case, some guys want to have a big project and dump 50k into one and that's not really advisable.

But 15k you should be able to get a decent running base truck with the 6.5 recapitalized/upgraded motor and the 4 speed transmission with overdrive.

So your ideal truck in that range should have:

\-6.5 N/A Gep block with the 4L80E

\-The highback ""commander"" seats

\-Some doors be it canvas or or x-doors in some cases

\-Complete roof kit, hard top may be pushing it. I've seen hard top 2 doors go for 15k aftermarket if you wait, even ones with the helmet top, depends on the seller.

\-tagged/registered already

If emissions aren't an issue you can go with any year truck even really recent ones, but if emissions are an issue there are no OBD-II ports on these things, so you may want to look at pre-1998 examples where your local laws may have an exemption on older diesels.

Double check if your state gives a shit or not about surplus vehicles on roads, California, Colorado and Michigan were states that didn't care but changed their minds about it. Texas on the other hand doesn't care as long as it passes a visual safety check with no emissions testing at all.

\-Also ditch the military wheels and that headache. Get 17"" Hummer alloy wheels so you can run normal off road truck/suv tires. OEM H1 one piece alloys can be had for 400-1000$ used for a set or find a used set of GT/Cepek aftermarket wheels or go with the rhino wheels if you want the military look without the headache. Makes it a smoother ride without worrying about trying to balance a 150# wheel assembly with the runflat. One of my friends runs 2500 series 8 lug dodge ram wheels on his hmmwv, he painted them back and got the wheels for next to nothing.",Hummer

"The term “LS swap” is thrown around so loosely it’s almost nauseating. The amount of fabrication and parts and labor for said ls swap is mind numbing. Do you have $40k for the H2 and the ls swap?

"**Pros:**

**Rode Like a Dream:** Jumping into the Hummer EV, I was blown away by the sheer comfort and smoothness of the ride. It felt like a luxury upgrade from my 2020 GMC 1500 Denali and that was already sumptuous for a truck.

**Roomy Yet Agile:** The spacious interior was a pleasant surprise, made the 1500 seem small, and the nimbleness, thanks to the four-wheel steering, made it a joy to drive. U-turns? Piece of cake.

**Luxurious Interior:** The cabin was a perfect mix of rugged modern charm and luxury. I loved spending time in there.

**Open-Air Freedom:** Removing the roof in both the front and back was a game-changer, giving it that awesome convertible vibe.

**Handy Adjustable Height:** The adjustable ride height was a practical touch for loading and unloading stuff.

**Crab Walk Gimmick:** Okay, the crab walk was more fun than functional for me, but it was a cool party trick.

**Trustworthy Self-Driving:** The self-driving feature was a step above my Tesla - more reliable and smoother. It felt like the future of driving.

**Range That Delivers:** The 325+ mile range meant I hardly ever worried about running out of juice. A real stress-reliever.

**Worth the Price:** For $112k, I felt like I got my money's worth with all these features. It's a whole lot of car when you compare it to the price tag of similar sized offerings like a facelifted GMC 1500 or Yukon Denali.

**Surprisingly Quick:** The 0-60 in low 3 seconds was mind-blowing for something this big. Every full-bore launch felt like the start of the Incredicoaster at Disneyland, but slightly more wallowy and 'fighty'.

**Frunk:** When not storing the roof panels, the frunk is a huge and secure bonus space.

**Profitable Sale:** Selling it for more than I paid was a bitter sweet bonus.

**Cons:**

**Charging Challenges:** On road charging was a bit of a headache, especially with non-Tesla chargers due to them being slow. I missed having more access to those super-fast 350+ watt chargers, although there are a lot more now, when they're working.

**Attention:**  Being one of the first on the road, it attracted a lot of curious and enthusiastic onlookers. I recall a time when I parked it at Target for a brief 15 minutes, only to return and find a crowd gathered around it, examining it with keen interest. Every traffic light was also always a conversation. While I expect this level of attention has diminished over time, as a person who prefers to keep a low profile, this was initially quite a surprising experience for me, even though every interaction was extremely positive.

**Home Charging Takes Ages:** If the battery was nearly empty, charging at home felt like watching paint dry (16 miles per hour charge isn't great).

**Tonneau Cover Troubles:** The electric tonneau cover was a bit of a saga - needed some tweaking at the dealership and I think it would have caused future issues.

**Sticker Shock from Markup:** That dealer markup stung a bit, hiking the price to $145k.

**Seller's Remorse:** Within a week I immediately regretted selling it.

**Conclusion: T**he Hummer EV would have been an ideal daily driver for me, and I eagerly anticipated the opportunity to take it on longer road trips once the charging network expanded. Reflecting on the ease and enjoyment of driving my Model S from California to Texas and back, thanks to Tesla's extensive supercharger network, I can only imagine that a similar trip in the Hummer would have been even more pleasurable, given its enhanced comfort, elevated stance, and modern features.

Presented with the choice of any high-end SUV or truck today, whether it's a new Range Rover, a Raptor, or a TRX, my pick would unhesitatingly be the new Hummer SUV 3X. The truck felt like a robust showcase of GM's over-engineering, being this first foray was undoubtedly a veritable test bed for future EV technology - it exuded a sense of indestructibility and I think time will reflect that.

Its unique blend of speed, open-air driving experience, innovative features, and practical utility as a truck made it a jack-of-all-trades.

In essence, the Hummer was a truck that was fast, fun, and truly unforgettable.",Hummer

Looks like it’s in great shape,Hummer
"$3500?!?! That's it???? My tires cost more than that. I could've put in 3 engines with the amount of money I've spent on one h2 since January, just mechanically. When we put in an engine and transmission in a few years ago, it was like $14,000.

Sitting here wondering why we have 2 h2's and not at least one h3. Going to be speaking to my boyfriend about this. Lol!

I would go ahead and put the engine in. You've already done so much, might as well go all out and finish it up. It'll be like a brand new truck.",Hummer
"The smartest thing to do would be to take it to a dealership that services Hummers or a preferred mechanic and have them perform a pre-purchase inspection. It’s important to do before any vehicle purchase, especially if there seems to be an issue",Hummer
"Also double check the ground wire to frame connection.  Even the wires to the starter motor underneath sometimes.  This is an easy check.

With it working prior but only partially now, it seems like an electrical gremlin or the key cylinder.  Which I hate.  There's some good YouTube videos on checking for ground/parasitic issues from the fuse box with electric meters.  Maybe try there.",Hummer
"I was usually the first to pronounce this a lost cause but time has changed things.  It's still not a drop-in replacement but the game has changed a bit...enough so that I'm considering it for my own '08.

First off, as /u/think_matt_think said, the most common answer you'll get is ""find an Alpha"".  Previously, that meant ""you'd be money ahead just buying an Alpha rather than trying to build your own"" but as you've noticed, that's not exactly a practical choice.  They're cheaper now, but they never made that many in the first place.  Well, consensus hasn't changed but today, ""find an Alpha"" has a different meaning:  There are simply some parts that you might not be able to get anywhere else.  You'll still need to swap in a ""normal"" 4L60E trans since the one behind the I5 had some rearranged internals in addition to a matched bellhousing and finding one of those in decent shape may be your biggest cash outlay (I believe one from a half-ton Silverado of equivalent year is the closest, but I still haven't verified tailshaft/transfer case mating).  Even then, you're still using a 4L60E.  A 4L65E will go in but a 4L80E will require some reconstructive surgery starting with a custom pan & driveshafts.  There have been one or two enterprising souls who worked on using a 6L80E which of course would be best but beware, that way lies madness...

Something often left unsaid about the H3 5.3 swap is that, like everything else about the H3, the engine is just different enough from the 20 other variants GM made that decade to be a not-insignificant pain in the ass.  The good news is that the LH8 in the Alpha is a ""dumb"" engine meaning no variable-valve timing, AFM, or DoD.  The bad news is the H3 was the only vehicle to get that engine in 2008.  2009 and '10 got the LH9 as did the Chevy Colorado/GMC Canyon, and that was produced through 2012, but has AFM; if you can get the ECM and fuel system to play nice it'd probably be your best bet.  On a basic level, the ECM and BCM are the same in both; you will still want the boxes from whatever vehicle the engine came from, but that's where finding an Alpha will make your life a lot easier regardless how trashed the Alpha may be.  An alternative is to send the ECM in to get reprogrammed but that's both time and money.  The further away from an LH8 your chosen engine would be, the more headache-inducing the black-box and harness work will be and these days that's where most of the time-investment goes unless you send it out.  I've heard a number of people say jUST uSE a 6.0 tHEiR aLL tEH sAME but those are people who have never done an engine swap without a lot of redneck engineering and a bit too much JB Weld.  I'm not saying it can't be done of course but as you're already aware, physically fitting and actually working without being a ""Mechanic's Special"" are two different things.  The one shop I've heard of doing 6.0 swaps on the regular charges some $19,000 for the swap using your own engine, so you can safely assume it's not a slam-dunk.  Personally I'd have a hard time justifying a 6.0 for a daily unless it was an aluminum block and for a ridiculously low price; the extra power doesn't really justify the additional work (or the abysmal fuel consumption).  Yes, you can build up a 6.0 to make a lot of power but then you're in the market for a cast-iron front diff annnnnnd guess which vehicle you'll have to get that from... 

A previous sticking-point was exhaust.  No other vehicle's exhaust manifolds would fit, so that meant ""find an Alpha"" or bend your own custom tubing (or have a shop fab them).  Time has somewhat fixed that problem:  Those and other oddball/specific parts have reached ""Rock Auto"" replacement status which makes things a lot easier than they were 10 years ago.  I hate to say it but the Chinese have really upped their game on that front; the once-ridiculously-priced ""all in one"" manifold/catalytic converter assembly for the I5 was regularly a $500 part and can now be had for a fraction of that, with a warranty.

In the interest of not being a hypocrite, as I said before I've gone on record with the idea that this was just throwing good money after bad but time has changed things; prices have come down and parts availability isn't quite as much of an issue.  Of course if I go this route I'll end up financing it with the proceeds from a pair of 3.7s which, considering what those are going for lately, should be just enough to cover the swap.",Hummer

I'd sell that car and acquire this one because i don't need extreme off-road capability, rather a good one, which i hear the Hummer is, the biggest difference is the Hummer can actually be driven normally on the road.

"The Atlas Motors typically use oil because either your timing chains are loose, or the cheap Chinese piston rings GM used are shot. Find a good machine shop around you and have the one in it rebuilt.",Hummer
"The biggest concern would probably be the transmission, but it largely depends on the year as to what other issues may be present. If it's a 6.0 L you shouldn't have much of any issues with the engine itself, the 6.2L with AFM may not be the same story. The 4l60 and 4l65e both have middle of the road track records (I can't speak much for the 4L80 models), with the H2's off-road design the transmission is tucked into a tough spot and unfortunately gets baked due to a lack of proper cooling. A tru-cool transmission cooler really helps and will keep your transmission running for a long time. That being said at this stage I would baby it if you were to get an H2 at that mileage. If you have the funds I would honestly recommend a rebuild if you have any doubts, it's much better to deal with it promptly before that leaves you stranded. Overall, it's a fantastic vehicle. Relatively cheap and easy to work on with a lot of functionality and personality. I have an 05 with 207k miles and only recently rebuilt the transmission and transfer case.  Hope for the best for you and God bless!",Hummer
Looks good!,Hummer
"Mine has two air bladders where I can adjust the ride height inside the car. I think it goes up between 4:00 to 6 in. There's also a compressor back there. You can fill tires and you should have a hose that it screws into the back right once you open the back. The compressor is a big deal because it's very expensive, probably very hard to find so if that works, you're in good shape. I was able to get the bladders but I was just sick of replacing them. They're not hard to replace but they constantly failed on mine, especially on the right side where it was closest to the exhaust. 
I did quite a bit of work on mine because my in-laws hadn't done any maintenance. I replaced the wheel bearings. A half shaft was cracked. An oil cooler line was leaking. I did replace all the shocks oil pressure sensor things like that.... Nothing that wasn't really painful.. I did replace the controller under the seat since the seat started going crazy on its own. 

The motor and transmission should be fairly standard parts, but I would certainly look at the four-wheel drive. I know when you go into four-wheel low you have to put it into neutral, press the button and sometimes there is a lag. I did replace all the fluids in the whole tranny system as well.",Hummer

"I have an 05 with the 6.0 and 80 is the top range of what I'm comfortable with driving on the highway. Yes I've taken it up much higher before but 75 is the best for it imo, anything past that is where you start to feel unstable. 80 is definitely doable in good conditions but if it's through hills and mountains it'll struggle. I'm currently undergoing a multitude of upgrades to get that to be better, particularly due to the limitations from the stock 4 speed in the truck, which I'll say is the real reason why the newer models with the 6.2L V8 perform much better (their 6 speed transmission). The 6.0 is a beast of a motor that can easily be brought up to much higher power ranges reliably, but the 4 speed mated to it is the main limitation when it comes to highway driving. That and the aerodynamics (or lack thereof) of the vehicle really start to show at higher speeds.",Hummer

"I love my H2 man, just rebuilt the engine and transmission and over 325k+ miles. 
I think the best piece of advice I feel like I could share is make sure to test drive it and feel exactly how the transmissions running perfectly, more specifically see if it sticks or anything whatsoever in 1st, 2nd,or 3rd gear when accelerating. If there’s any problems, don’t buy it. The biggest H2 killer was there transmissions being shot early on.

Mine is stock ride height with larger tires and 20in wheels and 75mph is smooth still.

"I don't recommend any engine swaps on any Hummer unless you have owned it and drove it for a bit.

Many people talk about engine conversions with no experience with the platforms.

It's highly unusual for an H2 to get one. Usually, it's the H1.

I've seen the odd Duramax diesel conversion for an H2, but that's it. I don't see the point of going from a larger Vortex GM GMT 800 engine to a smaller LS engine.

GM Truck engines in the H2, Escalade, etc aren't usually an issue for power, if there is, then I'd go the supercharging route, especially since you have cheap gas living in the MENA region. Remember that once you upgrade power, you'll have to upgrade the brakes, and driveline components. It depends on your budget.

If you have the budget, I'd shop for a nice US Southwest SEMA show truck at the big car auctions in Nevada or Arizona and import that to Saudi Arabia, or buy a truck that already has the work done in your area so you can test drive it. I'd start researching into shops that specialize in American trucks/suv's in your area. 

I'd just go with a stock H2 and just beat the hell out of it, keep it simple.

Be safe and good luck.",Hummer

"It depends, unfortunately the 6.0L is underpowered stock from the factory, so it really struggles with heavy inclines. If I'm driving on a flat road I can get it to stay between 13-15 mpg depending on the speed, but expect that to plummet as soon as you go uphill. In regular driving with moderate highway but mostly traffic/suburbs driving I average around 300-320. If you are on the highway a lot you can expect more like 340. It does have a little more juice since doing my cam but honestly the mpg was pretty similar to that before, a little worse but maybe about 10 miles less on the range.",Hummer

"Holy crap, this reminds me... my brother in law was deployed to a very poorly equipped outpost around Fallujah? Iraq as an engineer in the Iraq war. We mailed huge boxes of wire and connectors my dad dug out of the dumpster at Monroe Truck equipment in the early 90s to his unit to piece together humvees and other vehicles that were hit by IEDs because they couldn't get it though the supply chain.

Supposedly cas-evac was only so careful when cleaning out the vehicles as damaged ones had to be pressed into service. He found recognizable pieces of his bunkmate in one he had to finish cleaning out and it really messed him up. He just got his drinking under control a couple years ago.

It also reminds me of what his response is to hearing a gm diesel running or seeing a HMMWV... like staring off into space listening to my 6.5 truck run one day. ""I see body parts."" I also had uh, blocked that out, too. 

I'm not sure I want to terrorize my brother in law with that. I'm sure it's better and he can handle it but you bring up a very important point with that.
