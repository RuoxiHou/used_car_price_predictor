Citroen CX II Prestige. So top of the line interior. Build between '85 and '89 iirc,Citroen
Done some research and I can only find information about a BSI reset. Would that work,Citroen
I got grey,Citroen
"My cousin had one that he inherited from his aunt. It was a 1994 model and had about 30k km. When we took it for a spin it was really wobbly, even boatlike, and extremely light. I imagine the C2 is a bit more stable and less noisy",Citroen
"Are you sure your faulty clutch/flywheel didn't cause it to slip earlier, making it sound/feel easier to get going from a standstill? You don't seem very mechanically inclined based on this post/ your writing about the fuel mileage and stuff...",Citroen
And one of the best suspension designs alongside the DS.,Citroen
Alright; i‚Äôve googled around some and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be as widespread as I thought. Although 4 i‚Äôve driven have all done this. Let me know what your garage says.,Citroen
Interesting stuff. How much bump steer before and after?,Citroen
"That's hella sick mate, kinda want one now.",Citroen
"Alright I'll try doing the latter and check out diagbox, thanks and I'll keep you updated",Citroen
"everything seems fine, havent really had any problems yet apart from the driver door not staying open and the gear linkage kept popping out when we first bought it, dad managed to fix it by zip-tying a metal bar in there somewhere though. Nothing wrong with any of the electronics as far as im aware though",Citroen
"Yes , I have both original keys.
I did some testing today , if I try to start the engine without being in gear and no pedals pressed the engine turns but it doesn‚Äôt start , if I press the clutch the engine turns but it doesn‚Äôt start , if I press both the clutch and brake pedals the engine starts ü§¶",Citroen
"I'm no expert either, seems like you still have oil, but check it often, you'll probably see it get lower",Citroen
Tried volume via steering wheel. Source button also does nothing. Which is the one to hold for reset? Only one I can't work out is the strange indented thing on the left of the picture,Citroen
"Not sure about the old battery but for sure the new one does support. 
EFB027 Start/Stop EFB 12V Car Battery¬†",Citroen
"Sick, good way to show up 18 year olds in their Ecoboost Fiestas with a fart cannon.",Citroen
Correctamundo,Citroen
"Don't update the radio, the last update is corrupted and brick the car, several people is having the same issue",Citroen
Top of the range is the V6. If you find one go for it!,Citroen
"The chain is noisy on startup but doesn't take long to quieten, oil pressure is spot on, timing is great and really once its past 1200ish revs and doesn't grunt at 1000rpm it revs sweet, no limp mode, no engine light or anything but as soon as it returns to idle speed it goes into grunt mode again.",Citroen
If you don't already have it it's probably not worth it in your case. They cost about ¬£100 and are a decent bit of faff to set up. Best take it to someone who has one like a Citroen garage or mechanic that deals with Citroens.,Citroen
"Do you have the correct key?  
Or your cambelt  is fuk...",Citroen
"My friend has 3 boys ranging from 4 to 14 and happily goes around in his 1k‚Ç¨ Berlingo

So it's possible.",Citroen
It's a 71 iD. Thought about getting it as a parts car for my 72 DS,Citroen
https://youtu.be/JOYxiK5DrSs?si=Df-9Vl3oU-6Vp_KI,Citroen
What‚Äôs this button doooo duhhh,Citroen
"b618

without airbumps it looks bad.",Citroen
Sounds like a recall might be coming. I got a C5X too 3 months ago and no problems yet,Citroen
"Caliper rewind tool, https://www.amazon.co.uk/BGS-technic-1110-47000-Pieces-Piston/dp/B08FRH882B?th=1",Citroen
"It was that button. Looks like someone's pressed it a bit too hard.

Managed to get it back on again.

Any tips for fixing it/getting it out again?  Or get a garage to have a proper look at it?",Citroen
Maybe its just the tires that are causing this? Can happen when car has sit in one spot for a long time. Has happened with my C6 many times,Citroen
"My stepmum fit a wheelchair and pram in the back of an old Fiat punto, you'll be reet!",Citroen
"The throttle body is electronic.
My mechanic and a Citroen mechanic both said that this particular part doesn‚Äôt need calibration.",Citroen
Ah i understand. Well better to not update it than to slow it down with lots of update (ahem apple),Citroen
"I always thought my Xantia was very easy to park. Its rear axle is very close to the back of the car (unusually so for a saloon-shaped car), so there's not a lot of overhang to worry about, makes it easier to get in to tight spaces.
Could be that you're misjudging when to start your turn, a lot of people do it by the position of things in the back window, where in the Xantia the bottom corner of the rear screen lines up better with the steering centre.",Citroen
"Should be youtube videos to show you how, won't be difficult. https://youtu.be/2c7aW6k5nvo?si=CHAdo2UaOT8lKN24",Citroen
"Okay, thanks - affordability is the key in my situation, as I have a limited money limit. 

I drove my mums' car today, Suzuki Vitara and I don't like it - it's too big and chonky üòµ‚Äçüí´ I was learning in Toyota Yaris IV and I prefer that size, from the photos and occasional real life encounter I see that Citro√´n C2 is pretty similar to this Toyota. Also, I like the look and have seen articles suggesting that it's a pretty versatile & unique car. 

I am not a big ""car person"" but I want to do research and buy something good for my needs and that I like the look of. 
Driving today was rather okay, would be better if the car was not that big, but my parents said I am doing very well in manual. 
However I don't like the perspective of having to move around that stick, I was more leaned towards the automatic.",Citroen
"I can see similarities in the bumper shape. But if you rounded the edges off of the AX, it looks more like the mk1 C3.",Citroen
https://citroencarclub.org.uk/c5-mk1/,Citroen
"No, hybrid.",Citroen
"Stop start wouldn't usually throw a MIL, it would just have the stop/start button flashing, there's something else wrong with the car, and without codes to know where to look no one could help you.",Citroen
‚ò∫Ô∏è,Citroen
"I once informed myself on connecting xsara steering wheel controls to a 3rd party radio(10 years ago) and back then there were no adapters made, the only answer I got was ""The official dealership m√°y be able to help you for 100's of euros""..

Connecting the original radio to Bluetooth may be possible with something like a Parrot Bluetooth kit though.

If I remember correctly the original radio has a connector for a cd-changer too, maybe there are kits that you can connect to that?",Citroen
Welkom!,Citroen
Love that conversion!,Citroen
Beautiful.,Citroen
No bin it,Citroen
Dead battery. 100%,Citroen
"In Brazil its really common to do those checkups on third party garages, due to high prices mainly. So maybe they forgot to do it. But thanks for the advice!",Citroen
Best motorway cruiser I ever had. The only problem I ever had with mine was when he satnav reverted to French completely randomly on one journey.,Citroen
"I saw that you also have a similar post, and I replied there and also decided to make a new more detailed post, in hopes that someone will help. Let me know if you get help from the car audio shop.",Citroen
Here's my [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/sShOZs0q7z4?si=Llk-inRpENHC11Sq),Citroen
"This could be it. Its coming from somewhere around dashboard and yes, adound air vents/flaps",Citroen
Tu3jp engine?,Citroen
Those engines are fairly robust tbh and you've taken care of the Cam belt so you should avoid any catastrophes,Citroen
"Have someone remove it from the Ecu software, 
If you don‚Äôt mind the engine warning light on the disconnect the tiny connector on the earth terminal terminal.",Citroen
"Honestly depends on your daily routine if you are going on longer trips to work and back then diesel, if you are turning your car on 20 times a day, like i do, for short trips to the store, cafe, to friend etc then petrol. Diesel has dpf that gets clogged when you drive it for short trips and if regeneration or dpf cleaning starts you will interrupt it with short trip and will constantly have that problem.",Citroen
Les Rythmes Digitales - Jacques Your Body (Make Me Sweat) if anyone is wondering what the name of the track is called.,Citroen
Gorgeous,Citroen
I think it is a nice car. If you can get a good deal on lease hire that you replace after 3 years I still think it is worth it. TBH I'm now of the opinion that lease hire/PCP is better than ownership as older cars/high mileage just have too many problems. I'm tired of going to the garage!,Citroen
I‚Äôm shocked it‚Äôs still working tbh lol,Citroen
that's good news. How does it perform on motorways over 120km/h?,Citroen
I‚Äôm hoping someone will take the opportunity.,Citroen
"Never done that, just look at what the manual/google says the car should have and put that in. I mean you could send it to a lab for analysis but who‚Äôs going to do that ?",Citroen
What's the signal strength of the stations you're listening to? as DAB unlike FM or AM will cut out if the signal isn't strong enough instead of going fuzzy.,Citroen
Citro√´n patented Active Corrosion Protection System.,Citroen
I‚Äôve checked the link and I‚Äôm assuming this screen replaces the original screen. Tbf im not keen on the look of this. I could be wrong also because my stereo is the 90s shape which gets replaced with the CarPlay making it into a tablet etc,Citroen
I think it‚Äôs part of a sigma immobiliser,Citroen
"Well, i was wondering about 3500‚Ç¨. I personally dont mind that he is ""destroyed"" but i know it drastically reduce his ressel price. If i can sell his for like 1500‚Ç¨ i will rather keep it.",Citroen
Fill with Gas and you re good to go. :),Citroen
??,Citroen
Yay. I have the red one.,Citroen
"This is a conversion, there are 9 of these made in total if I remember. There is also a V12 C2 conversion somewhere üò±",Citroen
Turn off lane guidance on the mountain roads. Our rental car tried to kill us twice on those roads with cars coming the other way. üòÇ,Citroen
"Im glad im not the only one whos got the problem, ill probably have to repaint the area.",Citroen
"As far as I‚Äôm aware if it‚Äôs a 2.7d it‚Äôs torquey af but probably you get hit with the road tax. Don‚Äôt see any around these days.
Edit: grammar",Citroen
"Thanks for the help, I am probably gonna go with petrol then",Citroen
"Will look for used part. It is not structural, but a plastic cover for the bottom of the rear axle and suspension parts.",Citroen
"It won't break down just because of that, and it's a rental, a tiny bit of more engine wear isn't going to be your problem.",Citroen
"I have the same issue, Bluetooth paired up multiple times working fine, then randomly won‚Äôt connect, can‚Äôt go past screen in the post, ok button does nothing. Happened with my android and now my iPhone, bit lost. Happened before and sorted its self out the next day but shutting it off and, key out, locking and trying again does nothing so idk",Citroen
"Mine isn‚Äôt off to a good start. Drove it home yesterday, it is very comfortable and quiet, but it is vibrating very badly on highway speeds, and it gets much worse under acceleration. It‚Äôs at the garage, it probably needs new driveshafts.",Citroen
Not from new,Citroen
"I suppose it is a bit of a project! 

Also, very appropriate username.",Citroen
"It‚Äôs completely standard so would be around 210hp. I‚Äôve had 3 Codes and love them. As you said around country lanes they are great, although I‚Äôm still a Saxo Chav at heart. 
Thanks mate, I prefer the sleeper look to the Max Power equivalents.",Citroen
Yeah I'm not too surprised üòäfeels more extreme in my experience as my daily is a small coupe haha,Citroen
Citroen C3 before facelift (2021).,Citroen
Looks like it's for the hydraulic (hydractive I think they call it) suspension. So yeh that's the fluid feed for the strut. You'll need to get that sorted ASAP.,Citroen
"The vtr is the most powerful and you can check it in the dow√≥d rejestracyjny, i also suggest checking the car in mObywatel data base I was about to buy a ds3 in Wroc≈Çaw that was almost perfect but when I checked the mileage was decreased by 100k km. Just watch out and take someone that knows a bit about cars, also keep in mind that it won‚Äôt be a perfect car as it‚Äôs almost your age. Regarding the automatic, in Poland people treat them like shit and never change oil etc that‚Äôs just a 5k zl bill waiting for you, the manuals are idiot proof with a low cost for the clutch. Also a old Citroen automatic will be lazy and take too much time to change gears.",Citroen
"I had this in my Renault Grand Scenic. It was the scuttle drainage valves for the windscreen. On the Renault they run behind the engine and out into the wheel arch. Unfortunately, if they get blocked they back up and overflow into the foot well.

Mine happened autumn 22 and I had an inch of water in the under floor storage bins. Drained the out and spent the winter driving everywhere with the heat on full, dehumidifier boxes everywhere and the sunroof open. Had the valves fixed.

Happened again this winter, and I lost the tow bar electrics. The whole car stank.

Replaced it with a Grand C4 Picasso.",Citroen
"I've also heard the turbo's are more sensitive to timing belt problems. The car I'm thinking of isn't a turbo.

I've also read that the issues are resolved/preventable by changing oil annually and replacement of the timing belt around 5 - 6 years. 

Did you perhaps see the episode of Kassa about the 1.2 Puretech? If yes, what are your thoughts on it?",Citroen
Looks naked tbh,Citroen
I assume it has great fuel economy. I think they are good very under appreciated cars.,Citroen
I really hope for you that's the legendary infinite fuel button !,Citroen
"It‚Äôs honestly not too bad, the only time it‚Äôs really noticeable is coming to the top of a steep hill or a really bumpy B road. I‚Äôve driven the Mk5 Golf R32 and that‚Äôs much more noticeable in my opinion.",Citroen
"I hope I could get that of what you paid, to your new car, I would just give it a real good throughout clean, a good buff out, repair the little bit of damage and change the day time running lights for the LED ones of the face lift model and you‚Äôre all set, you have a cute little car with Toyota engineer that‚Äôs gonna take you wherever you want for a VEEEEERY long period of time as long as you put new oil and gas on it",Citroen
Reliability on Puretech 1.2 is dodgy at best. 180 is a safer bet.,Citroen
"VTR and VTS are just trim names. Maybe this engine list will clear things up for you:

1.1 L TU1 (1124 cc) I4, 60 PS (44 kW; 59 hp)

1.4 L TU3 (1360 cc) I4, 75 PS (55 kW; 74 hp)

1.4 L ET3 SensoDrive Stop & Start (1360 cc) I4, 90 PS (66 kW; 89 hp)

1.4 L DV4 HDi Diesel (1398 cc) I4, 68 PS (50 kW; 67 hp) and 111 lb‚ãÖft (150 N‚ãÖm)

1.6 L TU5 SensoDrive VTR (1587 cc) I4, 110 PS (81 kW; 108 hp)

1.6 L TU5 VTS (1587cc) I4, 125 PS (92 kW; 123 hp)

1.6 L DV6 HDi Diesel (1560cc) I4, 110 PS (81 kW; 108 hp) and 198 lb‚ãÖft (268 N‚ãÖm)

You see, I have the 1.4 L TU3 in VTS trim.",Citroen
"It‚Äôs got a fuel pump logo on it, what do you think it‚Äôs for?",Citroen
Did you like it? Tell us more about your experience :),Citroen
"Yes, the fix is good.",Citroen
"This is the same as a Lancia Thesis. In terms of uniqueness. Sadly both of these cars have 1 major problem, no aftermarket parts or originals left for repairs. Both have no problems with engines but the suspension on both is so unique of something goes wrong you can try only to buy second hand and pray",Citroen
Thanks for the info guys üòò,Citroen
"Thanks a lot for your reply!
Any thoughts on what it might cost to get this resolved?
We‚Äôre in Germany near D√ºsseldorf",Citroen
"Could ve coilspark , any code on obd app.",Citroen
Avoid the 1.2 puretech engine as they have issues with the wet belt degrading and the debris blocks the oil pump strainer,Citroen
"this looks sick bro, what alloys are those?",Citroen
"Good stuff, nothing ride as well as that in that price bracket.

Mine has 330k (200k odo :) ) and its still smooth, I did replace 2 front struts however, but I THINK suspension is all original other than that",Citroen
"Should be an easy 5L/100km with that. Are your brakes sticking or do you drive in constant stop and go traffic with low tyre pressures? The engine might also not just be running correctly with a faulty lambda or MAP sensor etc.

Or if it's really cold, do you have the front grille blocked off? (would not make such a drastic change, but it does affect it)",Citroen
thx!,Citroen
"Also, do you have that service lamp that sais something about particule filter? It goes on my nerves so much. I think that I need to clean injectors too cause my car doesnt idle or work as good as it can.",Citroen
I have never seen so much coolness and financial heartbreak in one photo üëç,Citroen
How?! Is it the front end of a c5/c6 stuffed in the front of it?,Citroen
"In terms of experience - I learned in Toyota Yaris III & IV 1,33 petrol (maybe hybrid in one school, but I am not sure), and yesterday I had a ride in my mums' car (I have temporal license from mObywatel) Suzuki Vitara and it's too big for me.",Citroen
Psa marks cars that got a stop-start function with stickers under the hood can't miss it. I doubt you got stop start tbh,Citroen
"Mine (138 Excl bit older and 330km on it) hit me with the wipers, wishbones, t-belt and now the dmf. Waiting on parts and some tools to do it and racking up the miles on the simpler car I should've originally bought in the first place! A nightmare but a lovely car when they work!",Citroen
"I will check it, thanks man",Citroen
"Thats your volume knob. It shouldn't be where it is. 
Press once to turn the radio on/off, turn for volume. Press and hold for reset.",Citroen
"Those are sick car, 2CV are cool !",Citroen
"Veeery nice. Good choice and a true Citro√´n, IMHO. I know the purists will probably give you a hard time, but ignore them. I wish you many happy miles behind the wheel",Citroen
"Been driving it without low speed for over a year now, a new resistor should sort it out",Citroen
"Yeah, they're a few thousand in the UK",Citroen
"The problem of the oil bath belt creating oil pump problems is well known. Check carefully before buying, but if you are only renting, i think it's ok.",Citroen
"this is a well known case. it is because car is programmed to take info from both fuel injection amout and the absolute fuel level sensor in a tank. if tank sensor dies, or car ""detects"" that it might have (like not moving at all) i will ignore it until a big change in fuel level is detected - like filling up. 

the solution to the problem? a kind of ""cheater"" device (electronics). Google tank fopper citroen - / peugeot / lando renzi. You even have a lando renzi ones.

they range between ~20 up to 100‚Ç¨. Its usually very easy to fit it and 90% of people do it on their own.


That being said nothing ""wrong"" will happen to your car if it just thinks tank is empty but it's not. Its just a convenience matter if you want to have an estimation and dont want it to beep from time to time.",Citroen
"Can't speak for the C4 as I've never been in any of them, but it's got the same engines and infotainment which for me is a turn-off. Citroen in general haven't made anything worth driving since the X7 to be honest. 

I don't know which renting company you're going for, but if they have one and it's in budget, go for a large saloon. Doesn't have to be a Citroen, but a large saloon will be significantly better for comfort and refinement, especially for motorways.",Citroen
"Man, I wish my car didn't have one...",Citroen
Whats the mileage that people change the belts at ? They should do it correctly.,Citroen
"Is the volume up? Try selecting a different source. 
Hard reset by holding the volumeknob pressed for 10 or more seconds",Citroen
"Nice ,but a v6 in a C2ü§î
  What' model has the '6' come out of?",Citroen
You should've cropped the fuel button out ü§£,Citroen
I watched this on mute but could still hear the music,Citroen
Why are these so cheap?!,Citroen
Not really. I've always had Citro√´ns and all went well over 350k km.,Citroen
"Have the C5 Aircross 130 ps (diesel though). It's sluggish at higher speed (80kmh+) and the only thing making me doubt if I'm gonna keep the car for long. It's just enough to safely overtake, it can climb to highway speeds (120kmh+) with no problem, but you are a gonna be dissappointed if you want to feel any kind of acceleration at those speeds. Definitely go for puretech 180.",Citroen
"That‚Äôs not possible for a citroen dealer unfortunately. 
The cars tax bracket is at a lower level because the car has stop start. 
A dealer wouldn‚Äôt risk getting into legal trouble by bypassing the system.",Citroen
"Very little, actually. The lift kit came from Russia before the war and the strut extension they provided was rather crude, required drilling out the top cups and only secured them on the top, like a solid 20mm sleeve

I came up with a custom extension that pinches them between nut and a shoulder so it works just like standard and keeps the standard diameter for steering cups",Citroen
It‚Äôs aftermarket by the looks of it. Probably a hands free? You checked your Bluetooth to see if it picks it up?,Citroen
"Yeah, if it has them",Citroen
okay thank you but I‚Äôm not sure I can do that myself haha. Would a garage do that for me?,Citroen
Autodoc and many other parts websites which use Techdoc data should have all the parts and numbers. as it'll use most of the same mechanical parts that my DS3 uses.,Citroen
Oh what makes you say that? Is it really that bad comfort/fuel economy wise? I have an option to upgrade to a C4 as well but trying to see if the C3 is any good as it is cheaper.,Citroen
It‚Äôs a normal viton O-ring just have to measure the spacing.,Citroen
It‚Äôs not a knob. The back is sticky it sticks on and has wire attached,Citroen
Pulled up too hard. Would have stalled before the airport perimeter,Citroen
"Ah, no, I mean the touchscreen menu. Didn't try the diagbox method yet, cause it's still under warranty!",Citroen
"What's it complaining about specifically? If it's something about it being clogged, give it a motorway blast for a bit and it should clear up. If it's saying it's empty then you need to get it filled up. The car is fine to be driven with an empty DPF, but it'll keep complaining at you. 

Unless you've got one of the BlueHDI engines that needs AdBlue. In which case it won't let you turn the engine over until you refill it. The car can run just fine without AdBlue, it's some retarded EU law that stops you from driving with an empty AdBlue tank.",Citroen
How easy it is to get the software and get it connected to the car?,Citroen
Cheers mate!,Citroen
Thank you !,Citroen
That's great. I'll get them all checked. Thank you,Citroen
"The nerve wracking part is nothing new to me, my background is in electronic engineering and I repair industrial electronics for a living these days, I just can't afford to have the car down for more than a few hours if it's not the weekend. LOL",Citroen
"I thought I was replying to OP, as I replied while in Tesco.",Citroen
"It only happened once in my 14 years of driving.
Definitely stay away from those big trucks with mixing drums, they are sure to drop little stones, I had a good distance and still didn't save my screen",Citroen

"It's been sitting behind a barn since 1993. I've restored another hydropneumatic Citroen already, so I have my resources for parts",Citroen
I can fit two greyhounds in the back of mine. You‚Äôll get a pram in no bother.,Citroen
"C4 picasso - flasks go in the storage between the front seats, just pull the cover forward to wedge it. 
Travel mugs fit fine in the cup holders, but only one at a time. Rest of the storage is very well thought out except for that, weird",Citroen
"The side doors can get blocked at the bottom, they're supposed to drain water through. 

Also try resealing the sliding door rails along the belt line, there's about 7 or 8 bolts which you can undo, then kinda shimmy the rail away as you close the door, no need to take the door right off.

You'll want to take the bump stops at the end of while the rail is off the car and attach them before putting the rail back on. Large cavity around the back in the bodywork so whack plenty of silicone on the outside and inside each bolt hole, then your job should be a good one",Citroen
Nope no dash cam xdq so can‚Äôt be that thanks for your input though,Citroen
Maybe I have phrased that a bit wrong. I need to attach the trailer which weighs just over 100 kg to the car twice or three times a year when I do work around the house and I need to drive away the branches and leaves and things like that :).,Citroen
"Is it 1.4L? Did you check your coolant expansion tank for any milky residue? Does your valve cover drip oil? Is your oil cap top white-ish?

Sound's like a gasket probelm to me, it was frequent for 1.4L petrol engines. Once resolved it did not happen again",Citroen
Bellend,Citroen
"I mean, those are cool af. Don't know about the reliability, but the cool factor is high af",Citroen
"Common problem with AdBlue. The best and cheapest solution is to completely disable AdBlue. Official dealership will not do that, so you will need to find some other garage. In Europe it‚Äôs now trivial ad costs around 300-400 euros. 
Dissbling AdBlue will not affect passing mot. Note that physically tank will remain in place while only software will be updated not to use AdBlue.",Citroen
"Have similar one... 1.6 hdi 90hp and it's amazing car to drive, sounds like train while is cold but with loud music inside it's really pleasure to drive around... Btw what petrol engines are ok in citroen? Does anyone can tell me, i hear that vti are not to reliable... Cheers",Citroen
"First of all, all the parts are discontinued, and it's really hard to find some. Even in France. Second, if you don't know anything, or bad mechanics, you need to first check if there is someone capable of maintaining hydraulic cars. 
Check if the car goes up and down okay, and if there is a ""clac"" often in the engine bay. It is the Conjoncteur/ Disjoncteur, a reserve of pressure. If it clacs to often run away. Had this issue, everything in my TCT was to be redone. 
And finally I have a MK2, which is supposed to be more reliable, and it still is an electric nightmare. 
Owned a 115bhp carbu, in MK1, the build quality is better in MK2, but the dashboard is less original. 

BUT, when the car works, it is a real pleasure to drive. I think the engine XU10 is quite reliable. The hydraulic and electric are the weakest link here.",Citroen
"I honestly have no idea, I just assumed both a mechanical and electronic one would have some sort of adjustment.¬†",Citroen
"I can't hear it, but that is 45+ years of heavy metal. Two things that come to mind: did they ever do a smoke test on the inlet trajectory? And a shot in the dark: something with the air suspension? (If it has that. Citro√´ns really shouldn't have that of course. Green balls ftw! ;-) )",Citroen
I saw a 650.000km TU5JP4 Xsara once.,Citroen
"Thank you for sharing your experience. It is great to hear that. I also have a small oil consumption when I drive it hard on the highway, but it is completely tolerable. The exhaust brecket is something I need to change also. I love that it has plenty of power but can be driven normally but it would be great if it had a 6th gear for the highway.",Citroen
"No once used the key cannot be re coded. 
The used remote will send a signal and that‚Äôs all the tester is doing! 
But there is 2 parts to any remote key! 

1 the transponder chip that doesn‚Äôt require a battery. This is used to start the car. 
2 the remote that sends the signal to unlock the car! 

Only buy a new virgin key!",Citroen
"Take it to a Citroen garage and get it booked in for them to replace.

You can see the belt via the oil cap?,Citroen
"So I have a short version, bought new in 2018, 1.6T (150 hp due to tax reasons) with 6 speed Aisin gearbox (this is a spec for the Russian market, so your version may be different), Shine trim.

I don't drive too much, so I only have 66k now, but I only do some maintenance - the only thing I've done beyond that is changing the transmission oil (a mechanic I know recommended it). Now I think I might need AC to be fixed - hard to tell it's too cold now lol.

There was 2 times when the multimedia screen was unresponsive for some time, but fixed itself afterwards.

Once I've had to replace a speaker in the front passanger door - though it was entirely my fault, was carrying some wood planks and was not careful enough.

And yeah, it is comfortable. I actually really enjoy this car - it has carried me and lots of my stuff to another country when I moved, has been a very nice car for travelling (even when the tarmac was no mo more). Oh, and I even took part in a race one lol.",Citroen

"If you have high oil consumption, I recommend doing early oil changes, maybe one every 2000 miles or 3000km (or 3 months).

I've noticed it can help reduce oil consumption after doing it a few times, and the low cost means it's worth a try.
After this, do changes at 6000 miles or 10,000km (or 6 months).

If you can do the changes yourself, or find a garage who will use oil and filters you provide, you can make sure the correct oil is being used.

For the oil filter, I recommend using the Purflux branded filter, as this is the one used in the factory, and is the one sold reboxed by the dealer. If you're in Europe, AutoDoc stocks the filters at a competitive price.",Citroen

It's generally a pain in the ass to replace, read expensive, and it's rather expensive on a used car. You can check if one has a DPF by simply googling it. One easy example is my C4.

"Sure, little review from my perspective over the last three days (totally biased & people may disagree which is ok):

Pros:

1. Exterior Looks: aggressive and eye catching, really caught my attention and even Italians move out of my way on the road, so I feel like it's a pretty intimidating car on the road.

2. Interior looks: one of the highest quality and classy interiors I've seen. It's sporty but not too flashy/colourful. Nice use of aluminium for buttons, shift paddles and steering wheel. Material quality feels 10/10, almost every surface is leather/alcantara (or a synthetic type, I'm not 100% sure on the spec). There are no creaks while driving and it is very sound, definitely beats my BMW m240i in this department.

3. Drive: having driven the car from Milan to Bolzano, I can say that motorway driving is comfortable and smooth, even at 130km/h, very little wind noise and the car glides over bumps nicely. It is a diesel so engine noise is very noticeable at low speeds, but that's not a problem. Being a diesel the torque makes going uphill very effortless.

4. Tech: can't complain overall, very good touchscreen with android auto, all the bits such as heated seats, reverse cameras, surround sensors and 360 camera are very helpful with such a big car and make driving very effortless.

Cons :( 

1. Driving position (subjective): I'm 6' with rather long legs, I struggled to get a seating position in which I could rest my elbows on the armrests as well as having my legs at a comfortable angle, there had to be compromises here which meant I had an achy shoulder after 2 hours of driving.

2. Sound system: I found this to be a little weak/shallow sounding, considering the car is optioned with a tech pack this was a surprise.

3. Performance: just like the car looks, it also feels like a bit of a tank to drive. Acceleration is very delayed and throttle feel is none existent, taking around 2-3 business days to react, but once it's going it picks up speed nicely. Same goes for the transmission, even in manual mode it feels very slow and sloppy. In automatic mode the car often gets confused and gets hung up in gears you don't want it to sit in and takes like 30 seconds to shift back up on its own.

4. Suspension: very good for motorways, but as soon as you get to twisty mountain roads, for example near alpe di siusi, you start to feel it's limitations. On sharp corners the car really feels like it's going to topple off the cliff with the huge amount of budy roll and it's really the opposite of confidence inspiring, so I would not recommend pushing it to its limit at all.",Citroen

I'd advise to get the 1.4 petrol, to my knowledge that's the most reliable. Do not ever get a C2 with the automatic Sensodrive gearbox. Reportertly, it sucks. In my opinion the 5-speed manual is very easy on this car. The good thing about older cars such as the C2 is that they are very easy to maintain and repair.

One caveat is road noise. It makes hearing music properly a little difficult.

My dad actually bought the car for me for 599‚Ç¨ after my first car's, a Xsara, head gasket failedüòÖ",Citroen
"Good choice, it's my first car, too. When you go over bumps or holes do you hear any knocking? The front wishbone bushings go every 3 or 4 years on these, mine's been through a couple of pairs over the last decade or so. Steering rack failure is a known issue on these, I'm lucky that it hasn't happened to mine, so I don't know what symptoms to look out for. Other than that, I've seen reports of wiper motors failing. I'd also find someone who has Diagbox to give it a quick scan for any fault codes that might be hiding.

The car is actually fairly reliable, the problem is when something does go wrong. They've become quite expensive to repair (at least in the UK) and finding someone who actually knows how to work on a big Citroen is harder than hunting a unicorn.

As a side note, if you haven't already, invest in a good set of tyres. They make a world of difference for safety but also road noise. I run Michelin Primacy 4+ and they're excellent, super quiet, fantastic wet performance and very good dry performance. Don't fall into the trap of thinking you need sporty tyres like Pilot Sports or something though. They're good tyres, but much noisier and you don't need them in a car like this.

"These puretech engines have lubricated timing belts. Usually timing belts run dry but this one is lubricated and is a main problem in these engines. It is prone to cracking, and if it cracks it bends valves (piston and valves colliding). It is also common that they have low oil pressure presure warning problem. This is related to timing belt issue that I mentioned earlier. It collects debris from timing belt and blocks oil filter. It is very important to use factory stated oil, because other oils tend to ruin this timing belt. If you dont replace oil on time, your turbocharger could also fail. Some services reccomend changing oil at 7000km to prevent turbo failures. Also your gasket is prone to blow. If it blows your engine can overheat and you will have to pay a lot of money to get your engine fixed. In my opinion, these engines are good to up to 150 000km.",Citroen
"This was on my feed so I wanna offer advice from 2 cars I've had that have had this. 

Corsa - there was an issue with the actual seals under the bonnet which kept letting water in and it'd pool in the footwells. Google ""corsa boot seal footwell leak"" and it'll show you how to fix it. Its probably similar. 

Civic - same thing. There was a damaged seal underneath the bonnet and it was an easy enough fix. 

Issue you've got though is the rust which means it could be a bigger issue. Probably run through all the seals, check they're all intact or not lose or anything. If all seals are intact, and the water isn't coming from the door (I don't think it'd drip into the cabin like that) try a dehumidifier. Doesn't take much for water to pool if there's a small crack somewhere letting it in",Citroen

This year: new tires, some lights, balancing and the exhaust got re-fitted (faulty placed back after the repair from last year and gave an emission-warning).

I had my timing belt replaced at 65k and since then the car has been drinking oil. Seems to be a big problem with the PureTech engines with piston ring problems. Lots of posts on here if you search for high oil usage / oil warning light.

I spoke with a Citroen dealer today and they've said that the belts have been updated with chains on the 2024 models but they still need to be replaced at 62.5k miles!

Personally I regret buying mine outright and wished I had changed it at the end of my contract hire deal instead. I think they are good, cheap cars if you can replace them at 60k miles for a new one on a lease type deal.",Citroen

"Not necessarily.
You just need to be aware that this is an expensive fix - I had it done recently (took quite a lot of phoning around to find someone that would do it) and it cost ¬£700 and that was just changing the belt and cleaning out the oil sump and pre-pump strainer. If the pump had needed changed that would've been a whole extra load of cost.
Of course all of this can be avoided if the belt is routinely changed before it starts to disintegrate.
For reference my C4 had done 38k miles. And it's a 19 plate, which has the ""improved"" belt that supposedly prevents this issue. It didn't. So I'm going to have to keep an eye on it after a further 30k miles or so.",Citroen

I'm guessing the timing belt has never been changed because the car's so young, but as others have said it's the main weakness of wet-belt engines like the 1.2 Puretech.

Other areas these cars leak: Radio Antenna on the roof, to re-seal this you have to remove the interior light from inside the car and undo a single nut. 

If it‚Äôs a 5 door C1, it‚Äôs also common for the rear passenger doors to leak, the sign the rear passenger doors are leaking is water fills the rear passenger footwells (not your symptoms)

Also, the rear boot lid seal is a common cause for leaks. It may be worth changing that at the same time given the location of your leak.

1) it's a bit more affordable. Your first car will inevitably be a beater (up to a level), and fixing and maintaining a used one with a manual is much less stressfull.

2) you learn more. Even if your next car would have been an automatic and every one after that - the experience and a bit of a feel for the machine will be better and remain if you opt for manual.

However, the 1.5 is also a reputable design and quite durable, it gives a bit more ""refined"" feeling while driving. It does require more maintenance than the 2.0, but nothing above the average.

(I have a PT130 because all the diesels I've managed to find in my country were in a shitty condition - performance-wise, the 1.5 is around the same as the PT130, so it should be more than enough for cruising on motorways)

So I'd say expect at least 850, and since you do 30km I assume it does have longer stretches - so you'll easily do 950+km on tank.

Two things I do:

1) always turn off start/stop
2) MAINTENANCE. I can't stress enough. On average I did 6k km to 11k km, but NEVER more - remember - oil + filter and car will be happy. of course on higher kms (every 50k and bigger keep in mind to check belt / water pump / leaks). I always do preventative maintenance - changed belt (and everything that comes with it - pump, tensioners etc) on 100k kms even though mechanic told me theres really no need.

Because you haven‚Äôt listed fault codes anyone‚Äôs help is a guess! But I‚Äôve worked for citroen for 30 years and the gearbox you have does have your fault as a common issue when old or high mileage.

>On a side note, the general spec seems a bit weird. It has nav (on a 2009/10 SD card?), cruise and speed limiter, bluetooth connectivity. Theres aux-in via RCA in the glovebox but no USB power. And basic things like parking sensors and bluetooth streaming are absent.

Optional extras were a mess on the C5, especially when it comes to the head units. By the sounds of it you have the VTR+ trim with an RNEG head unit. VTR+ is the mid spec and they slapped the nav on there to make it seem fancier (if you got lucky, you might have gotten the very rare VTR+ config that also runs Hydractive 3+ suspension). The SD card on that is only for extra nav maps, not media. As for the USB, I can't remember if this HU came with it, but if it does, the port should be in the central arm rest. 

The only head units to have BT audio streaming are the RD45 and RT6 (the next one up from yours). You have to remember, this car came out in a time when BT audio streaming wasn't really a thing, especially in cars.",Citroen

"Hi, I want to share some of my tips. I've had C4 1.6 BlueHDi engine. 

First things first - just don't buy with your eyes. I know, car is looking shiny, owner tells you it's amazing car that never broke. My advice is go to somebody experienced to check the car for you. You may be experienced - but you are also the one buying the car and you may overlook something. There may be some small leaks, some other issues you don't see or feel as of now. I know in my country mechanics would often have a ""check before buy"" service, but you can also go to MOT equivalent to verify how things are looking under the car. It would be also good to connect some OBD reader and scan the car (errors are not always showing as icons on dash, typically they are shown when things are getting nasty). As with any car, it's the dumb stuff that previous owners did.

Second - yes, these engines are good and they are doing a lot of KMs. But it's a Diesel. Diesel engines typically do not like short distances. When I owned 1.6 BlueHDi I was often driving 6 kilometers a day, and on the weekends I would travel somewhere 100+ kilometers. You don't need to travel 100+ kilometers, but I think 30-40 kilometers would be enough for a peaceful DPF regen. If you ask, I've never had any engine problems with this car. I changed Air conditioning evaporator because it was faulty and I did some work on suspension, but in my country where roads are like Swiss cheese I wouldn't call it a problem.

Third - maintenance. You buy a car - you change oil ASAP no matter what current owner tells you. I would also change timing belt way earlier than 280,000km. I remember when I bought 1.6 THP Peugeot and owner told me that timing belt have been replaced. Well, I took it to Peugeot dealer to change the belt anyway and they found out that belt was new, but belt tensioners were never replaced. I would also like to recommend to change your oil in between 7-10 thousand kilometers. 

And with that in mind, happy buying!",Citroen

I'm a windscreen fitter and perform this from time to time when they come off. We use a 2 part epoxy adhesive from Loctite but I'm sure similar products work fine. Do not use superglue. It won't work and may crack the glass. It's beneficial to degrease the area and scratch up the back of the boss to provide a key for the adhesive. Tape in place and wait until adhesive has cured before twisting the mirror on.

You won't do any harm unplugging the electrical connections to the mirror or rain sensor to make it easier. The plastic casing around the mirror unclips also but is a little fragile.

Oh, that's one thing I forgot to mention. Don't service it at the recommended intervals, it won't be happy, do it at half intervals. I do an annual minor service / oil and filter change.

Oh and the C5 is very picky about its battery. If you start getting weird glitches, bugs and / or behaviour the chances are that the battery has gone. Some issues you wouldn't even logically attribute to a battery. The X7 tends to reject its battery early, most cars can still get a decent bit of use out of a battery that an X7 doesn't want.

"Hello, I got one with 340 000 km, it is a 2.0 177 too. I bought it with 156 000 km and I can say it's a rather  reliable engine. I got a very small oil consumption, something like 1 liter per 10 000km (depending on how hard I drive it of course) that didn't evolve with time. I got one small  leak on the oil filter (one 10‚Ç¨ gasket to change on top of the oil cooler ), one faulty ignition coil at 300 000km (had to run it 30km on 2 cylinders with 2 injectors unplugged in order to not dilute the oil), one timing belt to change prematurely because the belt tensioner was faulty (don't buy the skf kit, gates one is better), one crankshaft spi gasket to replace at 230 000km, two top engine mounts, and that's pretty much it.
For maintenance I do my oil change every 20 000km with Total Activa 9000, air filter every 40 000km and spark plugs every 70 000km.
On the car itself, the central exhaust silencer often fail (I had to change it already 2 times and it's again already noisy) and the rear silencer is impossible to find (I had to weld back the brackets that broke at 300 000km and it hasn't moved since).

"Had same problem, i will share below solution in my case.
Error appears from crystallisation of adblue + low quality of adblue, injector is not spraying anymore plus/or pomp in adblue tank is not working properly/not enough pressure.
I did nothing mechanically, no disassembly, nothing.
I have added over existing adblue a very concentrated anti crystallisation additive. I‚Äôm not sure if same producers available in Australia but you can find alternatives.

Additive Mecatech D2U - [here](https://www.amazon.fr/Anti-cristallisant-Adblue-D2U-250ml-Mecatech/dp/B0BH4NHN5R)

Additive Tuneup 987 - [here](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/144667959713)

After that I have cleared the error stored in ecu (no km limit anymore).

I did around 700km outside the city, error appeared once again, cleared again.

Basically you should force the car to use the adblue, now with washing properties because of additive.

If you adblue tank is full, then go to service shop and empty it. 

There is no limit of how much concentration to use. I just did ‚Äúshocked‚Äù the system and added a bottle of 2 litre  D2U additive to ‚Ä¶maybe 3-4 litres of adblue.

My logic was like this: I cannot break it more then it is, since anyway there no repair only replace to fix the problem.

Now, 50k km later, problem was fixed and I always use same D2U additive in recommended concentration. 

Hope it helps.

Ps2: i have same car 2015 C4GP",Citroen

"it's not a C6 by Carlsson, Carlsson only did the C5, those also are barely more expensive than a regualr c5 if they pop up from what i have seen in the past. This C6 is from a German company called Musketier, this is their website:   
[Home (musketier.com)](https://www.musketier.com/)  
Sadly (or maybe luckily) it seems like they are only still making the rear muffler,",Citroen
"Very interesting, and you continued driving it like that? Did you find a fix and what was it?",Citroen
"You should have stopped after the 1st time and had it towed to a garage, now you 100% need a new engine.

sounds like the oil pick up strainer is blocked and starved the engine of oil, it's dead.",Citroen
"I have a C4ST and we use 500ml bottles, not cups. They usually fit there. We also have some slimmer thermos bottles that could fit, but that‚Äôs not really tested cause if we‚Äôre driving for long enough to need coffee, then we‚Äôve driven enough to deserve a fresh one, outsode the car.",Citroen
I love this ad!,Citroen
"Got some experience with a C3, which has a thing that looks like a stud, or a screw sticking out from the inside of the driver side (lhd) front fender, on which you can conveniently clip your negative wire. As u/skankhunt51 also mentioned, your entire chassis is ground, so any other bare metal spot will also do.",Citroen
Good luck!,Citroen

"It's rather strange that S/S is not showing up on the entertainment system. Although conditions for the S/S to engage may not be met (e.g. low battery voltage), option to enable/disable should show up on the entertainment system and the S/S icon on the dashboard should flash. 
When exchanging battery, system must be programmed to acknowledge a new battery. I recommend to check and read error codes.",Citroen
"I'm debating doing it but part of me can't be bothered. Have you seen the screens that plug in?

"Usually, it is a problem with the drain pipes of the sunroof being clogged, but I don't think you have one. Check if all the drain plugs in the bottom are in. Usually there are some in the footwells. You could also check if you see leaks inside while someone sprays all seams and rubbers of the car with a pressure cleaner.",Citroen
"Could be, makes sense to reuse it for other purposes, but I also don't see what would it be used for in an alarm system?",Citroen
"You‚Äôre clearly a numpty, the guy has explained his experience, how about answering his straight question with a straight answer? He clearly knows what he‚Äôs talking about and your comments are not based on anything other then you own a piece of shit that you are trying to justify, face it, it‚Äôs worthless, he‚Äôs absolutely correct any defect whatsoever is going to cost more to repair than it‚Äôs that piece of junk is worth by at least 10 times over, my recommendation to you is give up now because you‚Äôre fighting a battle you can‚Äôt win",Citroen
Is that for urban driving?,Citroen
Can bus going crazy,Citroen
"Forgot to mention, the car was made in 2006.",Citroen
1 careful owner I see...,Citroen
"Amazing car! 
Your brave!",Citroen
"Speaking as someone who hasn't driven a Citroen before and essentially a ""blank slate"" experience, the design did stand out to me and I really like it, not too many lexus cars around here or where I'm from so the resemblance wasn't too obvious",Citroen
Citroen part number: 9681912680,Citroen
I get them from Citroen website,Citroen
"When i switched to sports mode and ran over a apeed bump for example, the suspension would make a terrible sound. It did this always from new. Had to wait about 10 months to get the shocks replaced. Design flaws, back order etc etc.
Am now waiting to get the door to the charging port fixed. The internal spring has come loose.",Citroen
"No, you'd need a WRC or RX chassis to do so.",Citroen
"I tried to open the window using silvertape, unfortunately it did not work. The window didn't move at all.",Citroen
This just unlocked some very deep memories lol,Citroen
That's also really cool üòä,Citroen
Looks like a plastic bit of trim for the rear subframe?,Citroen
Check your vacuum hoses for cracking too whilst your in there.  Defo get dtcs,Citroen
"No solution, but at least you have cup holders. try buying a DS3 before checking if it has them.",Citroen
"I know about the adapter, but what BUTTON do I need to press to access the settings.",Citroen
"It‚Äôs not the dedicated speed limit/cruise control buttons. There should be a ‚ÄòMenu‚Äô button on your steering wheel or stalk that cycles through your OEM screen to access ‚ÄòVehicle Parameters‚Äô 
You will then be able to select and adjust 5 or 6 different speeds to save to you MEM. Then once you‚Äôre on the road, you‚Äôll be able to quickly cycle through each pre set speed using the Speed Limit/Cruise buttons.",Citroen
"Huh, well that‚Äôs interesting. Is that just all the suspension arm bearings?

Edit: Also did you mean bushings?",Citroen
"Replaced the central console
Because it lost the chrome",Citroen
"No problem finding people who'll work on them. Problem is finding someone who'll pay the hydro suspension (and everything else for that matter) due care and attention. Every time mine (used) to go in for any sort of work, it'd be back the next day because they'd never pay attention to it and it would have faults or completely wrong height. Not just that, they  didn't have any LDS so they returned the car to me missing 2L of LDS. Started working on it by myself before it suffered DMF failure (or at least i hope thats what the clattering is, will find out soon. Waiting for engine lift, more Jack stands, timbers and some other tools to arrive so can do it). This was a MAIN dealer. It got to a point as to when they'd give the car back and they'd let it half way down and leave it to try and convince me it was normal. F'ing scammers! Hence why any work that was possible for me to do was done by me. Have a Corolla now and is glorious to own and even to drive (great fun) but missing the smooth ride, refinement and everything about the C5. My first car that I literally spent all my money on and more and its now my one chance to save going to scrap.",Citroen
Mine has 265000 1.4i,Citroen
Good enough for Ronnie Pickering,Citroen
Only way of telling is to go to a dealership with your stroller.  My neighbour had a fiesta which didn‚Äôt fit a stroller as they bought a huge one.,Citroen
"I am driving it for 3-4 months like this, but it was extreme winter and I didn‚Äôt feel the need for urgent fix. However, spring summer is coming and temperatures are going high, so I am afraid to continue without low speed as it might cause more damage to the engine in hot weather.",Citroen
yeah I will go for 180 thx!,Citroen
Jesus Christ,Citroen
Other way round but yes,Citroen
"They call them the SM because of all the pain they‚Äôll inflict on you‚Ä¶
