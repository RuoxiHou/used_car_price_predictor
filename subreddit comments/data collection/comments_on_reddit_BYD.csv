"‚ÄúThe introduction of cheap Chinese autos ‚Äî which are so inexpensive because they are backed with the power and funding of the Chinese government""

Even if true, from the consumer angle and climate change perspective, this is amazing.  A government is subsidising consumers and helping the world to cut emissions.",BYD
"When you refer to 2401, where do I get that info? Is my Dolphin running 2310, based on this picture?

What changed?,BYD
There must be the same problems on all models. ADAS is a universal system. I have BYD Dolphin Plus and I have a lot of problems with ADAS. ü•≤,BYD
"Got it, thanks mate. Any other accessories you‚Äôd recommend having?

Also, what is the max size of micro sd card? I have heard mixed opinion about it being both 128gb and 256gb. How much does 128gb card store in terms of recording length?",BYD

"did that actually and did not solve my problem. still showing as not locked. app software = mobile. i was v1.5 and downgraded to 1.4. but this issue was from before i downgraded so the downgrade did not affect it, hence why i think its mobile software issue",BYD
I‚Äôve been pretty happy with the sound quality but I do think that with 12 speakers it could be a bit louder.,BYD
"What is the latest version?
I'm in Australia.



I've had mine since just before Christmas and it hasn't had any updates. I have used the search for update button several times now and have the same experience as OP, just a popup that it's looking and then nothing.",BYD
lol. If you want huge panel gaps and a battery you have to keep between 20-80%. You‚Äôve done well with your seal. You‚Äôll enjoy it.,BYD
"Sorry, I was not talking about location. Hope that will come in the app. I was talking about using any NFC device to unlock. That feature already exist in Brazil version of car (does not have any think to do with app).",BYD
Right for sure üëç,BYD
"Multiple brands I've looked at have always said no, you're down in warranty since the manufacturer has it logged as being registered and they can't do anything about it.¬† You must be better at negotiating than I am.",BYD
"Also the key is if it's flat or lots of hills. If reasonably flat and you have regen braking at lowest, a good chunk of the time once at speed you will be using next to nothing. If you are climbing, different story really.",BYD

"Good to know, thank you!",BYD
That seems like a rough trot. To be honest I don‚Äôt even have my NFC card yet. The printer/coder? was broken when I picked up the car so they said they‚Äôd have it at my 3 month.,BYD
"Thinking of getting the seal, what are the reasons you wanted to return it?",BYD
"Arh hehe, well glad it worked for you as well.

I think we have to wait a little longer for a bigger update. The workshop told me that they are expecting a bigger software update very soon.

I'm happy with the current fix tho. At least there is not a constant warning sound üòÖ",BYD
"Ah right, cheers for the link.  Certainly interesting to see how all this is handled. We have a Tesla and Byd in the garage so have vested interests",BYD
"Disable wifi. I had this issue, turning off wifi made Spotify start using data and fixed this issue for me",BYD
Did they take them off to apply the protection then stick them back on after?,BYD
"Nah, but based on the current size of the European EV market, it is certainly possible.",BYD
https://youtu.be/ni6Aq_oOJHs?si=6X_Ak6of-ZxLKWNJ,BYD
Isn't BYD Philippines already using CCS2 on their latest stock since Ayala took over?,BYD
I've had a bunch of trouble with them as well tbh,BYD

"I had mine since November, no problems with it. Where did you get info on cheap parts?",BYD
"Mine does, always, as soon as I release the accelerator, the brake light is on, with regen set to high. It does not engage when the settings is in standard mode and low speed.",BYD
"Yes of course.

Sorry, meant to include the link: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebgnOG2HlwA

They did two trips, without and with load.

Surprising Conclusion at 17:32 - they actually used *less* energy with 500KG loaded, likely because by that time it got slightly warmer. 

A friend of mine has bought the Maxus and can't tell a difference whether it's loaded or not either. What really matters (in general) is air resistance, speed and if you use the heating or not.

TL;DR: I wouldn't worry about passenger weight.",BYD
What phone do you use?,BYD
"My seal is planned end of june, i wish it will have it :x",BYD
Apple AirTag,BYD
"He hit a pothole. That's not warranty. He fucked up. Then he fucked up further by trying to get it under warranty. Bent rims and exploded tyre are in no way warranty. Ever. 

Correct course of action should have been ""I hit a pothole. I fucked up. I need the vehicle fixed, where do I take it?"" I have no doubt that BYD customer service would still have managed to arse this up, but trying to get warranty was wrong.",BYD
It's reliable in an area that has an abundance of speed limit signs,BYD
You might be thinking of Teslas.,BYD
"Yes, you have the link in the description here : https://youtu.be/sIYIMfKfy9I?si=JvP_WyoP2Q-EH2Z6",BYD
"Would people not use Bluetooth and connect instead? Using Spotify on phone, and then connect to the car via Bluetooth to play the music. 

That is what I do. Any difference to how you guys do it?",BYD
"Hmm nothing for me yet, I guess WA has to wait a while, as per usual :p",BYD
From what I remember the differences inside the car are that it has a heated steering wheel and you have electric child locks for the back doors. That and the fact I thought I‚Äôd lose my licence if I got the performance are what sold me on that the premium was enough.,BYD
"I think so, many people are fed up of waiting for affordable hatchbacks / suvs from legacy car makers.  In more established markets like Norway I think they may struggle",BYD
My favourite is 'Warm Tip:' instead of  hot tip,BYD
"I dunno, I've seen many prius models develop fatal issues at random points in their life. I owned one that shit it's battery in 3 months, and another that chugged along for a solid 10 years before just being out-of-date and running a bit fuel heavy",BYD
There's an outline of the key on the base of the center console mat. Was wondering what that was for on my test drive.¬†,BYD
You can negotiate warranty from time of purchase. That‚Äôs a discussion with the dealer. I am in Qld,BYD
I picked mine up on Saturday. I've switched off the beeping on the lane assist and it remembers that. I can handle the gentle nudge from the wheel,BYD
The tire pressure left rear seems to be high.,BYD
"Yes. It's the same with the Seal.

I couldn't charge my Audi Q4 to a 100% every day, which got a bit annoying. This is why I bought the BYD Seal.

Unfortunately I have had some issues with my car, that made me regret buying it in the first place.

Things like this E.g. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofqDCz0AUQ&lc=UgxB7nttGB0p1GBDjrt4AaABAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofqDCz0AUQ&lc=UgxB7nttGB0p1GBDjrt4AaABAg)",BYD
"They sold me the 2023 model as 2024, despite the 2024 model not being out yet, obviously that‚Äôs false advertisement. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm not asking for a freebie, what I‚Äôm wondering about is whether BYD will provide an option to upgrade the ADAS, and the infotainment for a fee similar to what Tesla does.",BYD
Some regions don't even have the wiring pre-installed. For me in Ireland it was a matter of just plugging in the cable. I've seen other videos on YouTube of people running wires along the trim.,BYD
Disable the ‚Äûcirulation on park‚Äú function. This should solve the problem,BYD
There are no v4 in the wild yet.,BYD
"Yes, and? My statement still applies if you‚Äôre needing to charge multiple times per week.",BYD
"I have the Atto 3, so not directly answering your question. What I can say is that I have been driving high quality vehicles for last 20 years - BMW X5, X3 and Lexus hybrid. 

By far and away my favourite car to drive is the Atto 3. It not only drives beautifully, but it has the feel of a quality vehicle. The fact that you can charge your Dolphin for free makes your decision a no brainer.",BYD
Cheers.¬†,BYD
Damn! That‚Äôs fast! How manyüê¥ does it have?,BYD
"Maybe I need to go test again, I tested this out just over a year ago. I have also noticed the brake lights come on when looking through rear-view mirror driving down a small local hill at night (no braking needed as regen keeps me at correct speed). But as it has been a while since I‚Äôve actively been looking for it so will look again next time.",BYD
"Right, probably not",BYD
"Might be that there's limited stock of the shark grey, I think it's one of the more popular performance colour options being limited to the top range.",BYD
Guessing that's just for the Seal?,BYD
Seal doesn‚Äôt,BYD
"Yeah, sounds like you‚Äôve been driving aggressively.",BYD
"Tesla report only a few chargers are compatible with EV‚Äôs other than Tesla. Check out the Tesla charger site locater.

It is most certainly a Tesla issue.",BYD
"Yeah same with Apple CarPlay. 
I hope BYD will fix this automatic wifi connectivity in the next OTA software update.",BYD
"The lack of tact in delivering an outcome that you aren't going to like, is not good.


Thankfully I've had the opposite experience with my local dealer; very nice, empathetic and apologetic when sorting things for me.",BYD
If you previously were told it was impact damage and then were told they must get it in for assessment about the damage I'd strongly suggest raising this with ACCC. It's the only way to hold that sort of behaviour accountabo. Hopefully you have it in writing somewhere or could get it - feels like a breach of consumer guarantees,BYD
"Yesterday afternoon I was driving into town, with ACC on at 100km/h and my¬†Seal suddenly started slowing down.¬† It flashed the hazards once and then just continued to slow.¬† I thought it was the ACC reacting to something that wasn't there and tried overriding it, but nothing happened.¬† I then stopped on the side of the road and used the Vehicle Health functionality to do a test - and it didn't find anything.¬† I then reset the car (turned off and on again) and it seemed fine.

When I watched the Dashcam I realised that for some reason it suddenly decided it wanted to try and go into Park, flashed the Hazards and then decided Neutral was a better option (at least it didn't pull on the handbrake!).

It happens at about 41 seconds.",BYD
"I believe the main issue with your post is the lack of information, and that's why it feels low quality/effort.

Mentioning the model of car, your region, vehicle software version, phone details, and steps you have already tried would allow others to provide you with information and tips that are specific to you. 

The Atto 3, Seal, and Dolphin all have native support for YouTube from a certain software version, and those running older software versions, have found alternative methods for acquiring the apps they want. 

Also, there are methods for running apps that are not natively supported in Android Auto.

If you provide more information, I would be happy to help you better.",BYD
"I think the hardware should be there since it can do wireless Android Auto, so it's possible they can update it for wireless carplay as well.",BYD
"Well cool to see a release, i haven't tried the Seal or seen much feedback regards errors or wants on the model. Is there anything you're hoping they're fixing or changing in the update?",BYD
It's also between these two colours for me (after my test drive yesterday) I'm leaning towards Grey,BYD
I find new to clean the front window every 1-2 weeks with window cleaner to avoid it and keep the aircon on while driving,BYD
"Sounds like the BMS calibration is off. 

Are you doing a sub-10% to 100% calibration charge every 3 months as is recommended in the manual?",BYD
Oh really that‚Äôs handy. I wonder if that‚Äôs what she meant. Practically what do you do to get the car battery power into your home battery? Does the home battery have a 3 pin plug that you plug into your V2L power board?,BYD
The only solution is low tech... Maybe something like a rubber band attached to the flap and somewhere near the charger port on the car.... Strong enough to pull the door mostly closed (just has to be less open than the with of the mirror) but also weak enough to not break when the door is all the way open. Im going to have a look at mine tonight...,BYD
"As a driver of the atto3.. the ADAS and other safety features are what scare me about my car.

Too many false positives. Have had a few good experiences as well, but all it takes is 1 bad incident..

The ADAS cannot handle roundabouts with walls on the outside.",BYD
"Not sure what car you currently drive but just over 5 seconds would beat quite a lot of ICE cars. I for one don't mind the slight lag, so I don't drive through the back of my garage. Bang for buck it's gonna beat near on anything in price range in Aus",BYD

"Mine does this as well. Just set it to free and make sure it doesn't swing.

I also have this extremely annoying sound coming from below the glovebox.

I recorded it in this clip (sorry It's in danish), you should be able to hear it as well.

"That is v good, What was your AC usage like?",BYD
"360 camera - yes.

Sentry mode? Nope... and no plans to either...A BYD policy (I am told) is that they won't go down the route of having a sentry mode feature. This is (allegedly) due to very realistic privacy concerns. 

What benefit does sentry mode actually provide without any recording?",BYD
"Hmmm I wonder if it's anything to do with your firmware version or if they've changed something. My Seal was fine there, once I got their stupid app to work.",BYD
Supercharger also never worked for me with atto,BYD
Will check thank you,BYD
I ordered my Atlantis grey premium in December and nothing. I went to BYD during the weekend and the sales rep told me they heavily underestimated the number of orders they were going to get prior to Jan 1 (NSW). They‚Äôre having a shipment arriving in 3 weeks,BYD
"If you're still in the cooling off period, look into Bingle, I just got a quote today and it's about $100 cheaper than what you're currently getting and I'm also buying a dolphin",BYD

Attos don't play well with Tesla chargers,BYD

"Hey, how long was the trip ?",BYD
"BTW Found if you add contact without an international dial code for me removung +61 and using 0 then it will show up the contact name when they call. Maybe in future update they will add in UI to understand phone number rules, but until then that sorted it for me. Plus I hardly travel overseas for my new job so not a big deal anymore",BYD
Speed limit of the road you are travelling on. If there's a speed limit sign your front camera will pick it up.,BYD
"I‚Äôm not going into details here about what when and where but I‚Äôll wait for your reviews in a few years of owning one. 

Like I mentioned I can‚Äôt wait for BYD to hit the US market. 

I bought my 2015 used Tesla model s for a fraction of the original price with very low miles and I‚Äôm very impressive performance and quality after nine years.",BYD
BYD uses LFP batteries which has a 100% depth of charge without degradation.,BYD
"Bingle was about half that! Think Budget Direct also gave me good quite, but had bingle from previous car and only good experiences with them",BYD
My recommendation is go with some other dash cam. BYD dashcam only works when the car is turned on. Use aftermarket one that has 24hrs surveillance.,BYD
"You'll enjoy the drive I'm sure.

I initially thought the same - but ended up going for the premium on my novated lease. For me,  it was the longer further range with more power plus the leather seats - for a small bump in fortnightly instalments (less than I was typically paying for fuel for a week).

I enjoy the extra power. 230kw vs 150kw jump would be a 10k jump if it were an ICE vehicle but the perk is longer range not less.",BYD
except when there is a service road with a different speed limit and it picks that up.,BYD
Mine is working fine in Hobart Tasmania. Local internet issue perhaps?,BYD
Anyone know cost to replace battery in a seal?,BYD
"Just wondering, as a prospective buyer, if you would still get the BYD if you were to choose again?",BYD

Ive found the windows go up if recirc is turned on either manually or automatically.,BYD
Go on to any BYD FB group and you will see posts about this issue. I have used the Gympie Superchargers because they are V2.,BYD
"don't run the AC in the car while it is charging, I have found it significantly impacts the charging speed and you will get that temperature management alert on the screen very early on.",BYD
The Seal is pretty sharp. Too bad the US won't let BYD in.,BYD
Looks like an Alphard. Hope BYD brings that to Australia,BYD
In Italy most houses run with a 3000w power supply,BYD
Do you mean the app or the nfc card?,BYD
"I‚Äôll be real, for me and those I know, this is not a positive. It is known specifically because of how dumb the name sounds in my experience.

I‚Äôll note here that I‚Äôm only responding to this because it was randomly in my feed and I have no strong positive or negative idea about the Cars, but the brand itself sounds completely ridiculous to most people I have had casual chats to about EVs.",BYD
"Ah, we were doing over 50km/h when we tested; now to check at a slower speed üòâ",BYD
"Excellent reverse psychology from BYD there.

"In Europe, it is not pre wired, but you have the slot for it where to plug in like the front dashcam.",BYD
"I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a good strategy. Once Mexico is conquered (that‚Äôs a strong word) the rest of Latin America is easily reachable. Canada too, in terms of distribution and logistics.",BYD
"Sounds good. But pity they ignore fixing existing technologies' bugs first rather than rolling out new and new tech (with probably some more bugs in them). Still, the future is coming.",BYD

"I have had one occasion when the charging flap was locked. This floored me. I spent sometime wondering how to unlock it. The car was not locked. But locking and unlocking the car solved it. 

But this is odd mostly for the fact it had never been locked before or since. 

I found nothing in the manual.",BYD

"The process before was to register your email via the dealer to access the app. So the dealer needed to send your email to China. Now any email can register in the app.

"Being able to disable it readily until it is fixed is probably a little more urgent.  Can do that now of course, with a tedious menu navigation and many clicks every single time the car starts - which has actually lead more than a few owners to just pull the fuses out for the ADAS system, which isn't ideal and reduces safety considerably",BYD
"In portuguese we have ""quilometragem"" for km and ""milhagem"" for miles.

Agree.  Can it be activated thru software update?,BYD
Interesting - I wonder what 1.0 means then..,BYD
19662921 bananas,BYD
Maybe make all OTA updates non automatic so the car doesn't change all the settings you like to what somebody else requested.  It should keep doing what it did before until you approve the change.,BYD

Thanks for all the background - I wasn't aware of just how much the service side is outsourced. They definitely had me fooled with the sales guy we got - he knew his stuff.

But regardless, I'm a little taken aback by how little presence actual BYD has here. That's disappointing.

I really appreciate you taking the time to discuss the whole thing man. And yes you're right it does sound like my issue isn't with BYD as a company but more so the subcontracted organisations. 

Thanks again for hearing me out and providing some really valid counter points for me to consider and learn from as well.

How did it go?

In an emergency you could probably use the 200V air-conditioner outlet (most houses have one) if the cable is long enough. If it's your own house, better to hire an electrician to wire a wallbox or a 200V garage outlet.

It has not been perfect but it's been pretty good. The service from BYD is mixed and not very good as you have pointed out.

I really feel that you might have just hit something and destroyed the rim as that is the most likely scenario. I honestly wouldn't put a huge amount of credit into what JAX say because I have dealt with them for about 20 years and they are pretty bad sometimes. 

It would take a significant impact to bend a wheel and damage a suspension strut. Now you may have hit it at speed and not noticed it but this doesn't sound right to me. I don't think you're giving us the full picture.

Unfortunately, the tone in the pitch of your comments indicate to me that you might be a difficult customer regardless. I say this as someone who has had a business for 25 years. So maybe you have some culpability in terms of how you're communicating with them which would not have helped.

This is not a BYD or Eagers issue based on what you said. Sounds like typical BYD poor communication mixed with a poor attitude on your behalf to be perfectly frank.

But if you want to push it there is no point going to the ACCC as they won't do anything. You need to go to your local state fair trading if you want a result.

"You will need to have a type 2 charging cable 22kw rated. You can buy it from eBay or super cheap auto. they have it in stock. This cable is required if you want to charge on AC public chargers.

The car comes with a slow charger, it charges like at 1.5kw I think. very slow. If you live in a house invest in a proper home charger that can charge up to 7kw. There are simple ones like wallbox for 600$ or more complex ones if you have solar and you want it to be smart enough to charge on excess solar. But more complex ones will cost around 2k

With LFP battery it doesn't really matter how you charge, depending on how much you drive you might not need to plug every day.

Then like other people mentioned install plugshare check out what chargers brands you have on your area eive or chargefox or bp pulse and install their apps.

If you have annoying beeps with a lane centering assistant, I found that on the latest software prevention instead of warning works better for me. it very gently steers you back in your lane without beeps.

"So you're being realistic, but you've also said that you don't actually know.

What's the chemistry of these batteries you're replacing?  What are they used for?  What is their charge discharge profile like?  What's the charge/balance controller like?

All cars depreciate rapidly, and 5 years is an eternity in battery development. And it's less than the warranty period. And effectively having a - ve interest loan on an EV makes financial sense no matter what you compare it to.",BYD

They also can't give you a VIN of one being created, as there is a laundry list of possibilities that means that car might not be your car come collection day.

Short of it, they need the $1000 to signal into their system that a vehicle needs to be allocated. When it comes time to actually sign for the car and do the bigger part of the payment, that's where you'll get your $1000 back if it isn't taken off the price already",BYD

"Modern EVs are extremely reliable. The LFP batteries last a very long time, they are rated for 3000 cycles. So the batteries on the 400 km Dolphin is rated to last 1.2M km.

Toyota warranty the Prius for 3 years/60k km, BYD warranties Dolphin for 8 year/160k km. Based on previous generations of BYD EVs, the Dolphin will likely last 15-20 years with normal driving.

I would not expect good resale value for EV/PHEV/Hybrid in general. New cars are getting better every year, EV tech is improving like smart phones 10 years ago. If BYD is showing up in your country, do not expect Japanese cars to hold their value. Used Japanese car prices have crashed in China because new EVs are so cheap.

If a Dolphin cost the same as a Prius in your country, that is because BYD is just testing the market. Once they optimize logistics, and get serious about market share, they will price their EVs to crush Toyota like they did in China.",BYD

Not only that, but to have a service specialist laugh whilst essentially calling you a liar, despite knowing that nothing was hit, is pretty despicable. No customer deserves to be treated condescendingly. Even if this was the worst case where we did hit something, the fault was completely ours, etc - the kind of treatment that I received over the phone from BYD and the fact that it was me - the customer - who had to constantly ask ""o..k.. so what are the next steps here?"" whilst receiving a nonchalant ""I'll have to check...this..that..and the rest"" over and over, shows a lack of expertise, lack of knowledge around resolutions, and a lack of empathy. I've had Hyundais, Toyotas, VWs, and and Peugeots in the past and cannot once recall a time when the people whose jobs it is to fix problems needed so much prompting from the customer just to get their next sentence out.

It won't have weird interior rattles everything that's meant to be tight will be tight, everything that's meant to be loose will be loose, and everything will be working as intended.


By contrast you can get into a 60,000 mile old Tesla 3 and know with almost 100 certainty that the b pillar trim pieces will be flapping around with failed clips, bits of exterior trim will be falling off etc etc.

Just as you know if you jump in a 200,000 mile old Kia you can be sure it will be on its 2nd or third engine, it's control arm bushes will all be flogged out etc etc

1. Novated leases do kind of suck more often than not. The tax dodge with fbt makes EV purchasing now very attractive.

2. EV resale value. This is where no one really knows the long term value of these newer cars.

I suppose I should have maintained a stoic, saint-like attitude dealing with this for an an entire work day's worth of hours in order for my grievances against a large multinational company to seem more...reasonable to you?

I have sung the praises of excellent customer service, and always dealt with people patiently when resolutions are needed. I have always ensured that my complaints are against the company - no ad homonyms as I mentioned earlier, and have never in my life even come close to being verbally harsh towards staff. The same can't be said for BYD/Eagers to be perfectly frank.

That aside, I do think the fact that a few of the BYD/Eagers staff I've spoken to have rather clearly mentioned that they are disappointed with the way BYD has treated this does add some credence to my side of the story. 

And irrespective of everything - I find it rather amusing that a company so bent on taking over new markets doesn't see the value in going above and beyond for their early adopters. Further to that - it is nuts that something as simple as a tow and wheel/tyre could take over a week with the number of service centres in Sydney.

"Hi, I'm picking up mine tomorrow here in Spain!!

Well, I've been learning about the Atto the last two months...so, if I can help...

Some advice on the battery:

\- It's an LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) battery, it's advised to charge it to 100% once a week to recalibrate, and from a very low state (10% or less) to 100% every 3 to 6 months.  If you charge it from a very low state of charge to full, it will count as a cycle. The battery is expected to last some 5000 cycles. So, it should last more than the lifespan of the vehicle itself (imagine that you decide to full cycle the battery once per week... 5000 weeks ..... some 96 years theoretically)

\- You can plug your car everyday if you want, but plan to recharge from 30-40% to 80% (depending on your daily mileage), after a few charges you'll get the timing, since our car doesn't have a charge limit as other brands/models.

I have read about some nuisances on the net: some users had issues with their low voltage batteries (12V) the first couple of weeks. Other user had an issue with the sunroof. There was a point where some Tesla superchargers (v3 ) weren't able to start charging the Atto. It seems solved to some extent (one of the first things I'll do is try to charge at a supercharger near home just to see if it works.).  Some people in AUS complains about regular service costs.

Overall most people is happy with the car and making trips and trying the Atto on long distances and doing quite OK.",BYD

"Welcome to the club!

I wasn‚Äôt told this directly, but have read here that you should charge your battery to 100% once a week and discharge it (almost) completely something like once every 3 months. 

Apart from that, there‚Äôs apparently no difference between regularly topping it up or only doing a big charge every now and then. 

Definitely look at getting a home charger installed - if you use the included granny charger that comes with it, you‚Äôll find that the charging speed is very slow, and you‚Äôll probably have no choice but to keep it plugged in whenever you‚Äôre not driving. 

Also get hold of the Plug Share app on your phone. This tells you were the chargers are around you, as well as which network they‚Äôre on so you know which other apps/accounts you need to have your charge your car while you‚Äôre out and about. 

The SIM card/data on your car will take about 5-7 days to start working. Once this does, you‚Äôll be able to use the BYD app on your phone. Just log in with the same email address that you used to order the car. 

At 5,000km you‚Äôll need to do the first service. This will be free at MyCar. It can take anywhere between 4 and 8 hours though, so don‚Äôt expect to sit and wait for it. Make some other plans. 

Probably the last thing is just be really careful to watch your speed. It‚Äôs easy to go quicker than expected in this car - it accelerates quickly and there‚Äôs no engine noise. Keep an eye on your speedo and work out how to use cruise control asap. Having the Waze app running also helps.",BYD

The issue will be that Tesla unlikely has done any interoporability testing outside what they have done in the USA for other brands that have taken on NACS. It's something that other charger manufacturers fight with regularly.

It's their business model. It's how they work. It's the standard procedure. It's the only procedure. There is no button on their screen that allows then to skip that part.

"I ordered an Arctic Blue Premium Seal on Dec 6 to be picked up from Cardiff.  I had called BYD's Customer service line then and asked to book a test drive. They said they'd set one up and I'd get a drive soon.

Didn't hear anything from them and phoned a month later. They said I could expect to pick up my Seal Premium some time in February. I changed the colour in Virtual yard to Atlantis Grey. I changed pickup to Blacktown, speculating more cars would be delivered there. The BYD CSR agreed with this theory.

I phoned again about a week ago after talking to the MyCar guys at the EV show. They advised to touch base with BYD in Blacktown. They also said they are delivering in order of when people put in their order. I advised some have been waiting since Oct and heard nothing yet and others ordered in Jan and picked up their car already. They were sceptical but said to let them know if I can prove it.

I talked to Blacktown BYD and they said they'd try to find me a car ASAP. They phoned again the next day to say they have an Arctic Blue Premium in storage I could have. I told them I'd take it when they said Grey is so popular it'd be another 4 weeks or more before any would be available and I really wanted a Seal by now.

I should be picking up my Seal in the coming week.

"It's absolutely doable. 

I don't understand what your 'fan' workaround is but have an Atto 3 and Seal on the way and with much the same base tech and cameras... it would be great for BYD to add a Sentry option that doesn't just film the front but surrounding views where any movement occurs. 

It would be a purely software update option for BYD to introduce.",BYD
"Yes, I've done this a number of times as I work from home. It is similar to running a small generator outside, but no noise and runs for a lot longer. I plug the special Atto 3 cable that has a powerboard on the end, and I can plug an extension cord into that to draw up to 2400W. I use it to power the computer and Internet until the power comes back on.

What the salesperson said was to ""use a generator outlet"", which means having a socket installed with a change over switch so that some house circuits can be powered. But that generally costs money and you can't run your whole house, just 2400W of power. You have to work with an electrician and plan which circuits would be switched over and which ones aren't, then pay to have the wiring done.

So it would depend how many power outages you have. I'm sticking with the long extension cord for the moment.

At the moment, I don't know of an EV charger that does two way power, which would be the nirvana.

"I track an ICE car regularly for a bit of fun. We get up to around 230kph. Which is fun and a little bit scary on a well-maintained racetrack.

Anything over about 160kp in most Western countries is well in excess of what is required for normal driving and will absolutely get you arrested. That's one of the big advantages of electric. They start to steam at about 180kph due to no gearing and that's all you would ever realistically need in any scenario. The rest is just a pissing competition.

There is no regular key. There is a keyless remote that you can carry in your pocket. The car won't move if it detects it is not in a car. Then there is an NFC. Never tried it . And once they connect your car to the Internet you can open the car via BYD app and drive it without a remote,BYD

"To be honest when I first started driving the Ioniq 5, I didn't like 1-pedal driving either. But after a while it became my preferred option especially in city traffic. You do have to 'train' your foot to modulate the throttle to drive smoothly though. If a driver were to be sloppy with throttle modulation it would make it a very jerky and inefficient ride.

You can certainly coast with 1-pedal drive. Just need to hold your foot at the zero kW position (it's easier than it sounds). I get 12-13 kWh/100km from my Ioniq 5 so I'm happy enough with the efficiency using 1-pedal.",BYD

Also the ADAS never tried to throw the car off the road, it tried to throw you into incoming traffic mate. This has now been fixed in software update, and even the Speed warning isn't as bad, but I'd like them to add buffer setting like I had in loan Atto 3.

It's not that they don't believe you or Jax, but I don't think any workshop for any product (car, bike, refridgerator, whatever) is going to automatically perform work on their own product based on the advise of an unrelated third party.

"As you are asking, I want full release notes with all software updates. 

In the last major update, there were announcements about three new apps: Karaoke, a browser, and an online manual. None of which I cared about or would not have eventually found. 

At the same time, they removed the sound the vehicles made when travelling below 25 km/h which was there to alert pedestrians and, I think, they tweaked the warning sensitivity to oncoming obstacles. But these had no mention whatsoever  
Given how these are vital to the vehicle's safety and general operation, I have to wonder if they were actually intentional or were a bug. I think they were intended, but without proper release notes, I cannot be sure. 

More generally I think proper release notes are good practice for any software product.  Which I think talks to the problem here. I wonder if they have realized that the vehicle is more than that. It is also a software product.",BYD

Thank you all for the input in helping me achieve this task.

Special thanks to the guy in the video for some details I would have been unlikely to ever find without it. 

For anyone looking to do this, it is definitely very possible  with the prying tools and with a bit of time. Now we just need to hope that BYD will release the software for sentry mode.",BYD
"The car is probably better fitted for 2 kids than 3, at least if you plan on having it until they're larger.

I think so, but pretty sure they're out of reach most of the times for the kids.",BYD
"Yeah it wasn't phantom braking, that didn't happen it's about sudden loss of Drive where it switches into Neutral. Pretty scary as out of blue, but damn scary at 100km, for me was only on local roads, but once while turning corner and had to coast through an intersection. 

Think Tesla phantom braking sounds pretty scary too, but that's by design isn't it, this is some sort of fault.",BYD
"I got the info from a close friend who lives in UK and he has an suv I don‚Äôt know exactly what model is but had many different problems with it.

Thank you for the comments",BYD
"The Atto 3 is far quieter as there is no engine noise at all over 30 kph and a low artificial noise at slower speeds to warn pedestrians.   There is also very little road noise.

"From what I have been reading, the ideal tyre pressure for the Seal is 35-36 PSI. Some people are lowering that to 32-34 PSI ‚Äúfor more comfortable driving‚Äù but I do not recommend as you increase energy consumption and the wear and tear of the tyre. For the same reasons, you don‚Äôt want over inflated tyres, so take it to an air place on a petrol station where you set the pressure, connect the air and let it set to the indicated pressure. Also: take the car with cold tyres meaning, as soon as you leave the house not after you‚Äôve been driving for a while.

In my case with the Atto 3, I seem to be losing air pressure every month. I should be at 2.5 BAR and a month ago I inflated my tyres to that pressure, and now it‚Äôs showing 2.4 BAR on all tyres. Maybe a normal thing in EVs? I don‚Äôt know.",BYD

I bought the Atto 3. My balloon payment is only $8k. My grand total cost for everything; the car, the balloon payment and five years of rego, insurance, services and tires will be $59k out of pocket. Absolute bargain. I also get to charge it at work for free. I paid the $900 for the charger and installation, but work agreed to pay for the power. Super sweet deal.

It use to beep when driving towards a car to warn you you‚Äôre heading towards a car, like if there‚Äôs a car on the side of the road and you‚Äôre maybe driving close to it. But now it doesn‚Äôt as often.

And its auto emergency brakes were very twitchy but they are now better to the point I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs even going to brake.

A situation like this, where a tire bursts without hitting anything and there‚Äôs a dent in the rim after driving 5000km, is quite unusual. While it could be the truth, a dent typically doesn‚Äôt occur without some sort of impact, and a tire bursting without hitting anything is almost unheard of (the dent is highly likely from bursting the wheel). It‚Äôs possible that this could be a manufacturing defect, but proving it would be challenging.

So many things could have happened here,

* tire was over inflated
* tire was under inflated
* Overloaded vehicle
* Potholes
* Puncture prior made tire flat leading to pop
* Heat build up/pressure built up

So many things so tbh I don't think this is a BYD specific customer service/warranty issue. Just hard or almost impossible to prove it is their issue.",BYD

The reason is because LFP batteries have quite a small voltage delta between empty and full, which makes it more difficult for the BMS to know the state of charge (percentage charged).

>Imagine I hypothetically left the car where it was - on the side of the road at 10pm on someone's property around the corner from our home.

I think step one of your retelling should include how you got there at 10am - your wife broke your wheel. It may seem petty of me, but the fact that you broke your own car and then worded the post like it was something that just happened to you spontaneously due to the car and not your wife's driving is pretty critical to the story. It shades all your future interactions with the dealer and how they view you.

>I call BYD roadside assist - one person says they can tow it so I get my hopes up. They come, ""inspect"" and then say lol jks we aren't towing it.

Perhaps the reason they couldn't tow it is due to the damage making it untowable by that type of tow truck? Not all tow trucks tow by the same mechanism. What reason did they give to refuse the tow upon inspection?

>""Yeah you can do that but you won't get it faster or cheaper!""

They weren't wrong about the rim necessarily. Did you get an atto approved wheel from Jax or did you get the exact same wheel as the other 3? They generally know what byd branded inventory is coming into Australia, so for all they knew, it was out of stock everywhere. It also could be one that looks similar but is not the same. I don't know enough from your details to judge. I'm also not sure I can blame the dealer for not knowing the inventory and labour costs of every other organisation in NSW.

>It just needs a new sensor and potentially a new strut. Sure. End of March is the earliest. Also $240 for parts

Seems pretty standard. Shipping for new cars is a bitch ATM and China's shipping logistics are way over capacity - there's a reason BYD just bought a couple of the actual container ships for their own use!

>Can I pay online in any way? Nope Please? This has been a long ordeal for a wheel and tyre and I just think it's a bit outdated asking for card details over the phone these days

Which as multiple people have explained to you is stupid - taking it over the phone is no less safe than literally writing down and giving it to the same guy who would've just written down your cc details and put it straight on the exact same form over the phone anyway. You've made things more difficult for no reason. Most mechanics I know don't have a web portal for payment.

The reason people came back with YTA is because all of your demands were either unreasonable or ignorant. You aren't wrong for being disappointed with wait times and poor communication, but you've omitted details and tried to spin it like BYD has totally fucked you and done some crazy business practices, but when pressed for details, it turns out everything was pretty standard and most of your back and forth on the phone was a result of you trying to:

a) get something for free that you weren't entitled to.

b) get something done that was against industry standard protocol

C) complain that byd didn't know the cost and inventory stock of every single third party company in NSW.

Nobody is saying BYD is perfect here and that you have to ""bend the knee"" but take some goddamn responsibility in this situation and realise that 90% of this fiasco was you wasting your own time because you didn't just organise a tow to Jax in the first place after your wife fucked up your car driving into a pothole at high speeds.",BYD

"Not an owner yet! I'll receive mine in about two weeks more. But I've test driven it and listened to several reviews, so here are some comments in case they help!
- Ride is smooth even in bumpy streets like the ones we have in Mexico. I didn't take it to the highway but have heard that if performs very well. The car is spacious and comfortable for both the front and rear occupants. It is very well isolated for noise.
- Far from a sound expert but from what I've read the audio system is above average on what you would expect for a car of this price.
- The car just launched here about 2 months ago so there are not many accessories locally but I did found some interesting ones online, mainly on Ali Express. Some of these I already have them while for some others I've read good reviews from current users in Mexico as well: center console tray, wireless charger tray, plastic mats, shift gear cover, charging adapter (it's offered with GBT in Mexico so I bought a J1772 adapter), console silicone pad, TPU protective films, key fob case, original DVR camera. 
- What to watch out? That depends on your drive habits and needs. For me the only issues I foresee is the lack of a spare tire (again: Mexican roads) and maybe part availability in case of a crash or warranty. BYD is expanding quickly in my country so I think I will be safe on that side (all brands have issues with parts to that end anyway).
Since it's a PHEV, make sure this is the right kind of vehicle for you. I would love having a BEV but I drive a lot for work and sometimes on roadtrips, so this car is great for me because I can use the EV range entirely for the city and charge at home when needed, but use as the HEV mode for longer trips.

I'm sure they'll bring them to Europe, after all they're a refresh of the Dolphin already on sale, aren't they? 

Right now they're selling the Dolphin in Germany, but it start's at 29k EUR.

If they managed to get the Dolphin down to under 25k and the Seagull to under 20k, they'd have winners.

I haven't found the service to be bad and they have done some extra things for free like cleaning leaves out of the radiator behind the grill, having said that I do find the dealership service staff could be more knowledgeable about the cars, they are clearly ICE focussed from the attached ICE dealership. We had some interior damage when the car was delivered which we didn't discover until a week later, it looked like someone had been taking protective material off with a box cutter. They didn't argue about it, they ordered replacement interior parts and fitted with no charges.

"In the Seal it's a lot more aggressive and prone to false positives.  I test drove the Atto 3 before buying the Seal and it's a night and day difference.

The problem for me though isn't the regular lane keeping assist which gently nudges the wheel, it's the emergency lane keep that kicks the wheel hard while you're turning a corner.  It's basically defective in the Seal on firmware version 2309 or earlier.  I'm told it's much better in later versions but after almost having a car crash because of it I'm not game to trust it until it's proven itself more.

Also, in 2309 and earlier in the Seal, that setting of vibrate or beep for the non-emergency lane keep resets every time you turn on the car (even though neither ANCAP nor ADR require it to).  If they're not going to 'fix' that due to their claimed ADR compliance nonsense, then this UI solves the problem without putting the vehicle out of compliance anyway",BYD

"Choosing the BYD Seal AWD, I had the choice between: Black, White, Atlantis Grey and Green-Shadow Green. Typically Black and White are very sensitive colors for dirt, collecting heat in summer more, and therefore decided against it. And Green - I simply don't like it enough to drive it, while it doesn't look that bad.

So, overall, I went with Atlantis Grey and I'm happy with that choice. Depending on the light and angle it looks somewhat between blue-ish and grey-ish.

For the interior color I picked Black. I just found it more visually pleasing, and it's less sensible to dirt IMHO too.

Outside of daily city driving we head down to our beach house 100km away 10-12 times a year and the odd 215km trip to see my parents where I can charge as we typically stay for 1-2 nights.

"What? One thing is the inverter, also known as VFD to move the electric motor or regenerate, and the other, the AC DC or DC DC for charging...

Is preferible to use a higher voltage input and lower it, than the inverse. In the first case you simply have to increase ampers as voltage gets lower but maybe the car won't allow it because of internals gauge. In second case you have to increase voltage, and lower the amps, but you are limited at what chargers are willing to provide you.

In fact, ampers are ruled by cables thickness, while voltage not. Then it depends on what your car demands and what charger is willing to provide.

Therefore, it may not charge at full power on both options, better find one that has same voltage as your car battery.

"Nope. Never needed to. I have a home charger so whenever it got low I'd just plug it in and the following morning it'd be good to go for the next 3-5 days.
I wanted to try to go sub 10% to see what actually happens. I've heard some odd things can happen if the battery isn't dropped very low occasionally. Unpredictable range etc.

Overall the DC charging was pretty good. 57 mins 10% to 100%. Obviously not as fast as some but pretty good. The 80% point came at 40 minutes.
It slowed to 35kw at about 55% then the battery cooling system kicked in (big fan noises) then about 1 minute later back up to 89kw.
Stayed there till about 80% , then dropped to 55, then to 35 then at 95% 11kw... The time periods between the percentage increases from 95 to 100% were all the same. I was expecting a real trickle for the last part but it was 11kw till the charger finished.

You should've just gotten the tow straight to Jax at the very beginning instead of trying to scam byd out of parts and labour for something you did yourself.

And yeah, many responders aren't wrong to call you difficult. It's not hostility, just them making an honest judgement call. Demanding a paper invoice for a credit card payment instead of over the phone where the guy at the other end will... Write the details onto a paper invoice form is quite frankly stupid and is emblematic of your attitude of demanding people do things your way, even if the end result won't be any different.

"Hey mate, thanks for clearing some things up.

I feel like the biggest problem you have is actually not BYD at all, it's the fact that BYD contract out the service side to other companies and those companies are collectively dropping the ball like a bunch of amateurs.

Even the showrooms and dealerships are contracted to Eagers, that's why it's luck of the draw if your sales rep actually knows wtf they're talking about. My local guy is actually pretty good and despite me knowing the spec sheet for the car I was interested in, was very knowledgeable and upfront about any limitations of the cars and features. I know others who have had to tell the salesmen what certain acronyms and features actually were because they didn't know jack about electric cars.

It sounds like the local towies they contracted out to do the RA servicing for your area are a bunch of fucking clowns. No surprise there, given how much of the tow truck industry is run by bikies. I know that some of the guys in Perth who have had their Seals towed had a pretty seamless experience getting it back to the dealership, so I don't think it's a widespread issue.

It also sounds like the local mycar (another contractor of byd) mechanic was probably just frustrated and gave you the ol' ""if you don't like what I'm offering you, politely fuck off and figure it out yourself"", which is pretty shit of him.


It's downright bad customer service, but it's pretty much luck of the draw if your local contractor happens to be a dick and that goes with any industry. At the moment, I think BYD's strategy is to establish some brand recognition and installer base by getting as many cars on the road at the cheapest price possible. Unfortunately, it means they've had to contract out parts of the business to a bunch of assholes who are happy to take BYDs money and then treat the customer like shit because it isn't their personal reputation on the line, it's BYD's. All I can say is get the name and details of the contractor and blast their personal Google page with bad reviews. It's early days atm and BYD hasn't had the time like the other car companies to actually open their own brand owned shops and infrastructure yet, but I guarantee you see a sharp change in customer service when they do.

>but...yes I did expect a portal. We live in a world where I can buy a BYD car on the website directly like its an Amazon fire stick - but they can't provide a portal for existing customers to pay on an e-invoice?

BYD do not actually own the mechanic, it's a different company who is running that part of the show, BYD just contracts to them. That's why you can buy a car online through BYD, but all the other crap has to go through Mycar or Eagers who are evidently stuck in the stone age and have 0 motivation to change how they do business.",BYD

I think atto3 has the same features except beeping when speeding. And it's been alright for me. I like lane keep assist. In the latest version it won't beep but gently steer away from the lane. If you don like it steering for you you can switch to vibrate or beep. You can't turn it off but you can set it up so it is ok.,BYD
I know right!!! This is China though. Atto 3 in Spain goes from ‚Ç¨35K to 40K‚Ä¶ which is already decent for the value you get.,BYD

It's almost as if the Atto is sensing if there is a car behind to flash the lights for 1 second... They didn't always come on, even if she was accelerating then suddenly took her foot off the gas. Need further investigation, it's not a simple algorithm. I think I need to hook up my buzzer to the lights get a better feel for it...",BYD

At Christmas it was pushing 300k on the clock and the paint was peeling off the roof so I figured it was time. But why, in 2024, would anyone buy a brand new ICE vehicle? Think about what's going to happen over the next 5-10 years. The world is only moving in one direction with regards to EVs.

My Seal Premium on a novated lease costs me MAX $15-$20 a week more once you compare the various costs re tax savings, electricity, petrol, servicing, rego, insurance etc than my Corolla. All expenses coming out before tax and the FBT savings are what does it.

My balloon after 5 years is $15,000, but there is no way my Seal is going to depreciate forty-five grand in five years. Even if the resale falls of a cliff, no way is this going to be a sub $15 grand car. And in the meantime, the difference in driving experience is nothing short of profound.

Better range estimate

Proper integration of the map with the cars current range indicator. Being able to overlay the map with possible ranges, and being able to set a destination outside of this range without being notified / being able to plan chargestops is a pretty damn important feature in a EV. All the friggin' data is there, use it!.

Better messages on the drivers screen. A lot of the messages seems either haphazardly translated, or just machine translated. They're also borderline programmer language (falsy/truey languages like 0 instead of OFF when turning the wipers off).

Tell me if my fucking rear lights are on. I live in a country where it's required during some situations, and i have no fucking idea if the lights are on unless i manually turn on the foglights to be extra sure.

In relation to that, stop dimming the goddamn screens when i turn the lights to auto.

Fix your local translations, in Danish ""Hot tip"" has been literally translated to ""Warm Tip"". Which doesn't make sense.

Make a temporary setting for being in a carwash. I pull in the mirrors when parking in the wash, but when i turn the car on again they auto deploy which can be a bit troublesome with a whole machine moving around the car once it's finished.

Some way to stop charging from the car itself, i've had a few chargers just being locked down and being unable to stop them from charging (can always force disconnect though).

This. 2015 Nissan leaf is worth around 10k. EVs might lose value faster, but they are still new, unknown, less supporting infrastructure and a dedicated and embedded industry against them. 

Every point I have read against them is an old argument that assumes everything stays exactly as it was in 2020.

"I acknowledge that no one is saying BYD is not at fault at all - I am extremely frustrated that the two people who told me things could be done were vetoed. It's strange to me that towing the car privately to Jax should have come as the first option when roadside assist exists? 

RA deemed it an impact accident and refused to tow the car without inspecting it at all. BYD themselves were baffled by this and have escalated that (so I'm told) with the RA company for future events, because the one guy at BYD who was actively trying to get some sort of resolution was unable to get RA to even look at the car.

With regards to a) I feel like my point is not being understood here. After ""taking responsibility"" I was met with ""No""s from all parties. After being willing to pay for things, I was told that I now had a very expensive brick sitting at my home. 

B) what was I supposed to do? The company I bought the car from was unable to even look at it. I even offered RA money for a private tow and they refused. I don't understand how a photo of a damaged tyre and rim was enough to declare the car untowable, but the local lovely tow track guy who'd never touched an EV came along and did so no hassle. 

C) Not a complaint about them not knowing. A complain about them not needing to say anything at all but choosing to say something snarky like you won't get a better solution. There was absolutely no need for that. 

This was seriously a chance for a new company to show stellar customer support, industry-leadership, and a positive commitment to existing new owners - even if it came at a fee - but again I truly wish you could hear the way I was spoken to by all but two people in this whole situation.

Regarding payment - I want clear on this but...yes I did expect a portal. We live in a world where I can buy a BYD car on the website directly like its an Amazon fire stick - but they can't provide a portal for existing customers to pay on an e-invoice? I understand the place selling parts is attached to the BYD physically but also sells parts for a few other companies - but come on...it is strange for such a future focused company with innovation and cutting edge solutions at their forefront to not go with a parts dealer that can at the very least provide a b-pay option... again - this is more of a straw that broke the camel's back situation.

The other day V8 commodore decided to have a go against me at these stupid lights we have when entering the freeway.  I didn't have a great start, and I kept up with him easily.",BYD
"For me its more about squeezing three late teen kids in a back seat.  I dislike the Atto's interior but think its better suited, but the seals saloon setup is also a bit average for a family.  Hopefully this weekend we will drop in and do a fit test at least to start the process",BYD
yeah my car has a limit but if you floor it it will go past it,BYD
There were broader internet issues today. Could be related.¬†,BYD

Basic dynamic seal aurora white. Kept getting told 4weeks and when I call 4 weeks later it's another for weeks. Till now!!!!,BYD
There is 0 stock on seal in my state in Australia so this is a bs comment,BYD
I got my new 12v under warranty,BYD
Also like the Tesla sudden braking..,BYD

"7kW on an AC charge so roughly 32A at 240V (240x32=7680W or 7.68 kW) because you'll have some losses in the charger and cabling etc.
DC charge you can do 88kW but that's not for home solutions.",BYD
"So yes, exactly it's underdamped adding weight will help, but I'll need to add like 100kg or more 

The seagull is very good, inside the city it's super comfortable and it's a little bullet, but when you go above 80km/h because of the rear suspension it can get a little unstable, but this is only in highways of countries like Mexico where the streets are imperfect 

The seagull it's crushing the sales here

About range if I'm conservative I can get 397 kms 

I got the 55kw motor, there is no 70kw option in Mexico",BYD
"it is $1500 more IIRC.

There have been people waiting for blue interors since launch, so good for them I guess?

BYD don't seem to ship based on orders, they just send stuff.

In states where they had enough blue interiors to cover orders, they were contacting people and asking if they wanted to switch.",BYD
"I have an Atto 3, can fit two car seats and a teenager comfortably in the back. Have also done many nappy changes in the boot with no issues. 

The kids love it, especially when we open the sun shade and they can watch the rain/starts/car wash through the sun roof.",BYD
"yeah those guys will customize any way you want. They actually make all those adapter tails themselves.

lol with sport mode it seems to be the only option,BYD
Yes if I scan with the Byd app and not with the iPhone camera I also get still the code expired. However I got my car from Sixt so maybe they deactivated it,BYD
"Speed & accelerator use only ones worth concerning yourself with TBH. Drag's not a linear thing, so driving at 63mph v. 70mph  doesn't equate to the 11% difference in energy use you'd probably expect.

So (Dolphin) unless I'm in a hurry I tend not bother going beyond 63mph. Beyond that I drive with everything on year round - if you've the need to disable A/C or other electronics daily then you've got the wrong car IMO.",BYD

"Ahh dead 12v, happened to me as well, although it was covered by warranty",BYD
"Just thinking out loud. As an EV is basically a computer on wheels it must become cheaper than ICE vehicles eventually. I wonder whether this will help that happen.

The Qin Plus appears to have been around since 2012, and started off as plug in hybrid. As an EV it apparently sold 128,000 units last year. So from what I can gather, this appears a fairly tested platform. The main difference appears to be price - having a base model that is incredibly low priced and could be the next Corolla. A 'people's wagon' like the original Volkswagen concept.",BYD
"The premium version have sunroofs, they just don‚Äôt open, it already has a camera system I was just wishing it could natively record and just because it‚Äôs a awd they don‚Äôt have to change the design of the car too much lol üòÖ",BYD
"I ordered BYD Performance in Shark Grey with Ocean Blue Interior back in mid-Nov. First told it would be late Jan, early Feb delivery to Brisbane.

Told by customer care in late Jan it was confirmed with the next shipment, arriving late Feb to early/mid March.

Very frustrating and confusing because BYD Sales keep changing it... saying Ocean Blue Interior was always going to take a long time (if so, why tell me Jan/Feb when ordered?). They've told it looks like May/June... and last week said it might be April and also then said it looks like it'll be going on to the next shipment. 

Then a couple of days ago Customer Care said it was looking on track for mid-March.

I feel they have no idea, their system between ordering, manufacturing and what's shipped to Australia is badly disconnected and no one here has any real clue and they'll lead you on as much as they can and just hope something arrives before you cancel the order out of frustration. Just the feeling I'm left with.

Would be great to know the truth and if BYD is really that poor in it's customer journey and order fulfilment.",BYD
"BYD claims the pack has a life span of 3,000+ charge cycles, or the equivalent of driving an EV 745,000 miles without needing to replace the battery. Enough of the doom please",BYD
I ordered the black interior and they said late jan early feb and I haven‚Äôt heard a word yet,BYD
Oh right. I ordered through the service centre in Dandenong back in mid Feb. Went by the dealership to get an update and was told mid to late april :(,BYD

My dealer definitely said they have roof racks when I went in to pick up some BYD floor mats. I have never seen them though. There was a guy on here asking about fitting them with a rooftop tent because he and his partner liked to go camping. Don‚Äôt know if he did it though.,BYD
