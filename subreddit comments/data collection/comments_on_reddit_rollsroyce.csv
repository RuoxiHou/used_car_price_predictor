"Back in the 70s, there were people who would put Rolls grills on Bentleys.  Around the 90s, people started swapping things in the other direction.  It was all about exclusivity.

Rolls Royce and Bentley were essentially the same car except for badges, the radiator, and the bonnet.  (Bentley had curved panels up top to match up with the curved radiator)

At one time, the Bentley cost $200 less than the Rolls.

The Bentley was ""lower profile"" and fewer people bought them.   Then people decided rarer was better.",rollsroyce

I‚Äôve been in real estate for a long time and this market is exactly how the market was pre ‚Äò08. Tons of predatory loans. People over stretched on rental properties. All kinds of bad shit.

There is just something about that generation that makes it look like the best Phantom IMO,rollsroyce

Those aren‚Äôt rented. The phantom is owned by my friends friend and the cullinan is owned by my friend and I was lucky enough to be polite to him when he had no car at all and now he drives me around in the cullinan. He also has a Phantom Series 2 on the way.,rollsroyce

BMW have owned RR since 1998 when RR got split between RR and Bentley (Volkswagen Audi Group own Bentley).

"Agree with the previous comments regarding the double vs single headlamps. The double headlamps are an iconic trademark for both RR and Bentley. My fave, hands down, is a 1965 Bentley Continental in British racing green with tan interior, green top roll and green carpet. I've gravitated to Bentley as I've become older. As a kid and through my teens... a 77-79 RR Silver Wraith II, fitted with picnic tables was my grail, followed up by the Corniche convertible (pre the cheesy digital clock phase.... analog all the way). The 1965 RR Silver Cloud 3 Flying Spur, the brother/sister to the '65 S3 Continental, also beautiful in every hand built way, I certainly wouldn't say no, but my heart's desire is no doubt the S3 Continental. I'll stir the pot here, but what are the readers thoughts on Lunaz Design (UK) and the insane, stunning, Herculean, and absolutely F-you $$&¬£¬£¬£ efforts to take your maybe not so reliable, harder to source parts, iconic classic and break it down, bolt by bolt and, re-engineer the entire car to make up for the displaced weight lost from the engine. Lunaz will then, for all intense purposes, wave their magic wand and do their Voo-Doo, and deliver you, what looks like a NOS (new old stock - sans the Vaumol), re-born classic that is faster, handles better, has mad-man torque and is fully electric. Let the gloves come off... I'm curious. Arguments on both sides of the aisle. I'll just say, they are the craftsmen of the 21st century. My two cents. Thanks OP, great conversation.",rollsroyce

"First congratulations on making this wise ldecision. RR as you know stands for luxury oppulense. Own 2 RR Ghost + Wraith. Not a big fan of the Cullinan however wife wants a cullinan. 

Have driven the Cullinan as a loaner from dealer great SUV - fun to drive and sits higher off course drives same as the ghost. Note cullinan is slightly shorter in length vs the ghost. 

I love my Range Rover the other RR. 

My weekday car wraith & weekend car is the Ghost, absolutely love it can be driven or chauffeured. Absolute luxury for big guy nothing to worry plenty of space in the front& back seats. Cannot speak for Black badge have only driven once.

Tha ghost is very intimidating and pronounced. Yes the ghost will be lower or your driving a truck / suv. If you go with the cullinan you will enjoy its a very nice and luxurious SUV. 

I am biased recommend the Ghost. Stay away from Phanthom over powering and you have to be chauffeur driven, this car you do not drive. 

Either one you decide will be a rewarding experience and ownership. Good luck and welcome to the RR Club.",rollsroyce

i never liked the physical appearance of rolls-royce models from ‚Äò82-‚Äò98 personally. those ‚Äò99-‚Äò02 silver-seraphs, park-wards, and cornich√©s were the greatest body styles to ever come from the manufacturer in it‚Äôs history. with that said, the ‚Äò97/‚Äò98 silver-spur interior options, undercarriage, & standard safety mechanisms, were all top-tier as compared to the ‚Äò82-‚Äò96 silver-spirit models. best of luck to you, and whatever you decide on, post it to the thread so we can all take joy and basque in your new found luxury purchase with you!",rollsroyce

"Trust me when I say this, hardly any dealer makes their money on high end vehicles. The money comes from the trade-ins that you can get for the low low but can sell higher. Usually a $3-4k profit margin. 

These exotic cars can often cost a lot to purchase, and then to recon for sale. 

A lot of the exotic cars you see at dealers (speaking from experience) are cars owned by owners/execs of the dealership group or store. Also depends on the clientele and demographic, but hardly does a used car manager go out of his way to buy an exotic car from auction unless they have a buyer for it.

I guess they‚Äôre more affordable than a closet in San Francisco so there‚Äôs that. Also you can afford to buy Rolls Royce. Just not to maintain one. There‚Äôs a bunch popping out for sale for like 5k usd. There are also some classic ones in really nice condition for less than new Prius or civic. New ones seem to cost around 350-400k pounds. Basically 4 times how much Audi rs6 or Tesla model s costs. Tho for 400k pounds it‚Äôs much more likely that you‚Äôd want to buy a house or apartment which would only raise in value. Or a secondary residence somewhere nice. But if you really wants a Rolls Royce it‚Äôs something you could do. Tho I much rather would buy an awesome apartment and civic type r for that money. Tho if I already had a nice apartment and a civic and that money in bank I‚Äôd consider RR. It‚Äôs not extremely impossible to be able to afford such a premium car.

"I've owned several over the years. The older ones ('90s and older) are expensive to maintain due to part availability and lack of common knowledge to repair. My silver seraph was not expensive to maintain but it was in excellent shape and I didn't put that many miles on it. 

My phantom was a daily driver for me. Initially I had a lot of up front repairs (apparently it has been sitting and about a month into ownership things went wrong) but after everything was repaired correctly, I really did not have to put any money into it. 

Oil changes aren't cheap (assuming you go to an authorized dealer or a specialist) and a lot of specific parts aren't cheap either. Some parts can be picked up from BMW and swapped in and those are relatively cheap and easy. For example my passenger rear door handle had gotten ruined and it cost $4,000 to repair. The part alone was $2,500. 

As for parking, it's sat outside underneath a tree as I park most of my vehicles. It's just a car. I had paint protection and film on it. Looks brand new. At one point I was building a new house with a nine car garage that had a specific garage just for the phantom (due to it's size) but I never ended up completing that house (COVID). 

If you're looking to buy one that's not under warranty, you need to get a pre-purchase inspection at an authorized dealership and have them give you everything that they see wrong with it. Good luck!",rollsroyce

You can make a rolls royce have the bmw UI, make a BMW have the Alpina UI, make an alpina have the rolls UI, or any combination of those. You can do cold start deletes, change the chime sounds, turn off warning screens, change the startup animation, and since it has a modern bluetooth module, you can enable video streaming from your phone/laptop/etc. and watch movies on the idrive screen.

While comfortable, most of the luxury features are simply cutting edge technology, which breaks a LOT. Over 20k kilometers, it sat quite a few times at the dealer to get electronics or software issues fixed.

The steering is so soft / light but it‚Äôs also really, really weak and I‚Äôve hit light potholes twice and damaged things twice.

It‚Äôs the option I actually mentioned. Key fobs are set to work on a rf signal only released when the car owner pushes his unlock button.

In settings there‚Äôs a on/off mode so the signal is only released the exact moment the fob button is pushed. The only way for the thief to steal the signal is when the button was pushed and then even after that your cars ecu randomizes your signal so it‚Äôs no longer able to copy and retransmit the proper code.,rollsroyce
