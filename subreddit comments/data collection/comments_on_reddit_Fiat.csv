"I see, so a 2.4 with automatic transmission then. The ""Drive mode unavailable"" fault can be caused by a number of things. A fault in the Transmission Control Module or the ECU. Could also be just a glitch. If you disconnect the battery and reconnect it after 10 minutes, if it comes back you know its persistent. Besides that, a bad battery can also cause weird electrical glitches, so good idea to check the voltage as well.

I read in the Fiat Forums that it could also be caused by a bad thermostat. Did they replace that also when replacing the housing? I read that it's a big job on the 2.4 engine, so makes sense to replace the thermostat as well while you have access.

Check the manual to see what type of spark plugs it uses. If they are the nickel type they can last 30.000 miles, but they can wear out and cause misfires long before that depending on the engine. Dirty throttle body or MAF and blocked breather hoses can cause also cause a rough idle. Usually a cheap and easy fix.",Fiat

The cause are probably 2 or the valves, or the pistons.
Hopefully are the valves.
 Have you tried with some high quality, or higher viscosity oil? ( Bardahl oil or some oils additive?) 
Do you have a good mechanic to talk with? In the short term you may have no problems, but in the long run probably yes. ( Spark plugs, compression problem, lower power...)",Fiat

"My experience as well

My son lost his keys so we had to have it towed to the dealership, in the meantime I unhooked the battery cable because the keys were on backorder for 3 months

When the keys came in we went to the dealership and I told them that the battery cable was unhooked before they started.

Aside from the ridiculous cost of the keys and having to replace the body control module as well, when they went to program the keys the car wouldn't accept the programming.

The tech said the electronic control module needed to be replaced, also on another 3 month backorder and thousands of dollars.

Seemed bizarre to me because the car was perfectly fine when it was parked, body modules shouldn't go bad just sitting.

I asked the tech what steps he took to troubleshoot it and they actually printed off the page of the service manual and showed me. According to their own service manual they skip almost every basic troubleshooting step there is.

To me, the very first basic step is to ensure the battery is charged and connected.

I walked back to the car in their service bay and popped the hood and grabbed the terminal I had already told them was taken off. The tech had put it back on, but it was super loose.

I tightened the terminal and asked the service tech to try again. Magically, the electronic control module was now working perfectly fine...

Saved myself thousands of dollars and months of part backorder just by walking back there and tightening the terminal.

I couldn't believe it. Never going back.

I'll buy the damn expensive ridiculous factory scan tool myself before ever going back.",Fiat

"I know of people in Austin that go clear to Dallas or Houston for service. I can't afford to do that so I'm still dealing with the Austin location. It was a royal nightmare for years. At one point, the sales manager, service manager and some other manager had me on speaker phone in their office threatening to call their loaner car in as stolen if I didn't return it within the hour. The agreement signed said I had 24 hours to return it once I was notified that service on my car had been completed. I learned from one of the techs that my car sat in the back for 2 weeks and no work was performed on it. I ended up trading the brand new Abarth in and being majorly upside down, financing wise, to get rid of it. Fast forward to a few years later, randomly came across the new owner of my traded in Abarth on Facebook and oh the stories we shared! 

The only thing I've found that has helped has been to dig my claws into some major networking and it has absolutely paid off in the end. I used to have anxiety attacks and my blood pressure would spike to stroke levels when I pulled into the service dept in Austin. Thankfully, due to some major and persistent networking, I haven't had a single problem since.....knock on wood. I, unfortunately, am looking at having to move 1500 miles back north and am worried about finding a good service dept there. I was told ""any"" FCA would work on these cars. Not the case.

One downside to the Abarth is that the engine bay is extremely cramped. This can lead to higher than expected mechanic labor times because the front bumper often has to be removed from the car in order to access the components that need fixing or maintained.

The Abarth 500 only left me stranded twice over the course of 165,000 hard miles.

Once was because of the shift linkage cable snapping. Full disclosure I did have an aftermarket short shifter adapter installed which was most likely placing additional stress on the cable that it was not originally designed for.

The 2nd time was because of a catastrophic transmission failure. Basically the transmission seized while cruising in 5th gear. The car required a new transmission in order to become operable again. This is when I walked away and moved along to my next vehicle.",Fiat

Also not changing oil because you are just constantly adding oil ignores the necessity that is changing your oil filter. 

You really need to change your oil and make sure no coolant is in the oil, (when there is coolant in the oil, it looks milky). If there's no coolant in the oil then the engine shouldn't be damaged in any other way than lack of oil changes/proper oil level, which really shouldn't be much damage at all.

"I had a 500 for 7 years (I live in the US). It was a 1.4 multiair with manual transmission. It wasn‚Äôt really bad, but it was clear it was built cheaply, which makes sense as it‚Äôs a fairly cheap car.


I had about 140,000 miles on it when I traded it in and by then I had replaced a few rear wheel bearings (rear wheel bearings only seemed to last about 60-70k), door handle hinges (I think I replaced the drivers side twice and the passenger side once), the clutch and release bearing (replaced at about 120k, I taught 2 or 3 people how to drive a manual transmission on this car), the alternator (at about 90k miles), and the timing belt and water pump (regular maintenance at 100k).

Never had any problems with the engine or transmission internals, and I did all the repair/maintenance work myself. Also note that I was not easy on this car. I treated it like a pickup truck (it can hold an incredible amount of mulch with the back seats folded flat) and drove it like an F1 car every day during my commute to work. I also entered it in a couple of Rallycross time trial events, which did inflict some additional damage that I did not list above due to the extraordinary circumstances (a broken engine mount, loose bodywork, etc)

All that to say Fiat 500s are pretty reliable, especially for their price, at least my 2013 US market car was. Little things will break or wear out, but parts are cheap and they‚Äôre mostly easy to work on.

If at a dealer they said they connect the car to their computer and adjust the timing that way- so there‚Äôs probably some associated cost with that.

As for oils, and the rear shocks- really easy to do at home- I did ours on the driveway.

ENGINE OIL CHANGE RESET - IF
EQUIPPED
Your vehicle may be equipped with an engine oil change indicator system. The ""Change Engine Oil"" message will display in the instrument cluster display. The engine oil change indicator system is duty cycle based, which means the engine oil change interval may fluctuate, dependent upon your personal driving style.
Unless reset, this message will continue to display each time you turn the ignition switch to the ON/RUN position. To reset the oil change indicator system (after performing the scheduled maintenance), refer to the following procedure.
1. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position (do not start the engine).
2. Fully push the accelerator pedal slowly, three times, within 10 seconds.
3. Turn the ignition switch to the OFF/LOCK position.",Fiat

-----------------++++++----------

Perhaps this is due to different countries being sold different versions, but I thought the 3rd gen only had a petrol  twincam 1.0 90hp or a 1.3 diesel 90hp (a boosted variant of the 1.3 75hp multijet originally found in the 2nd generation pandas and puntos and some other cars)

From my point of view: Not too long ago there were a lot of 3rd gen pandas sitting in used car dealerships because A) it's a common car for cheap rentals B) it sucks and people who brought it regretted it later.

Either option doesn't go in any good way because if you're looking into a basic ass low mileage 3rd gen panda you're likely looking at a previously rental car and we know those aren't really treated with the highest of care and esteem from people who rent cars, and you're likely sitting on a car one or several Americans used to discover they couldn't just ""learn on the fly"" how to drive manual. Then if you aren't looking at that, you're looking at a car that despite coming with a few extra options the previous owner felt dissatisfied and decided to part with it for whatever reason. Truth is, I won't ever buy a 3rd gen because they're fitted with technology expectable in a low-mid range car from the late 2000's at an higher price. Again, maybe different country bias: I find many 2nd gen pandas at the same price of some used 3rd gen pandas in online used markets. I can buy used Audi and Mercedes for the same price as an used 3rd gen. Are they older? Mostly yes but they offer better quality, power, confort and boot space for your money's worth vs a fun, modern looking interior, because I find that's the only redeeming quality of the 3rd gen.


The obvious direction here is the 2nd gen, and now you're looking at a car that in general feels slightly underpowered and has horrible cornering lean, and with the added age of any components you find in it it's going to need some maintenance soon. They did fix the cornering on the 3rd gen by making the car look fatter, but they also made it heavier so the 3rd gen's 90hp feels the same as the 2nd gen's 70hp. 1.2cm¬≥ on the 2nd gen panda feels funnier to drive than the 1.1 but mostly always just not really as much fun as it could be. If you're lucky to live in a country which received the 1.4 100hp version consider this option with the fact in mind that those versions were treated like sport cars and probably abused as such. The only somewhat passable version of the 2nd gen was the 1.3 diesel multijet but it comes at the price of eating as much fuel as 6-7L/100km and having absolutely no reliability if you're pushing it, but if you take it slow and easy then you're looking at a car that can do under 3L/100k on a highway and can last you years without major issues, if you can find one with less than 160.000km


But while we're here, let's not leave the one least worse option off the table, if you're looking at pandas why not the 1st gen? Reliable as a Punto, handles like a Uno, but less vulgar than both and relatively cheap to maintain. You can get one with the mythical 1.1cm¬≥ 54hp FIRE for a quarter the price of a 2nd gen panda, and there's a ton of versions with a dual soft top ceiling you can open in summer and pretend you're driving an Italian convertible sports car at 80km/h (they go up to 130km/h but let's not do that... just don't...the lady is 30 years old, show some respect) 
If you're looking to purchase one, watch out for rust in the truck and under the back windows.


And you know what, fuck it why not the 4x4 versions? They can take you anywhere, literally. The 3rd gen feels too cushioned and city-like to feel ""right"" while offroading, but it does offer some decent capabilities. The 2nd gen is a capable car but again, suffers with the side lean and it can make it insecure and stressfull to tackle some trails. The 1st gen feels like the perfect car for a Sunday drive with the family into nature and has impressive offroad ability, but your family doesn't all fit inside and the ones that do aren't comfortable to go sideways on a paperthin chassis. Either generation of 4x4s will be expensive and then drain your finances in maintenance if you're looking for frequent treks into the wild.

What is weird is that by scanning the obd I could see that the body computer recognised the stick (e.g when turning the stick on, it was obd scanner saying ""activated"" and when turning the stick off it was saying ""deactivated""). If it's not the clutch sensor, I will start believing that it's indeed the ecu without this capability. Otherwise it's weird",Fiat

But I was under the assumption that If i absolutely had no choice but to take it there that I would at least get the best of the best care. Absolutely not the case. There was no quality control whatsoever at my dealership. They even left what looked like a rolled up piece of foil from someone's taco or lunch laying on the drivers seat when I picked it up. Forgot to add that to the post. The dealership should be ashamed of themself, yet nobody took any blame. I called twice today to try and get the general manager of the location to talk to me so I could make a complaint and both times I was told he was busy and would call me in a bit. Never did.

"I would have definitely done the work myself, even tried the few local locksmiths we have in our area to see if they could do the key. They said they could do just about any automotive key, except Fiat.

That was super annoying, especially since the closest dealer to us is over 30 miles away. That was an expensive tow just to start with. I think it was all together $1800 and 3 months to replace one key.

The worst part is that the dealership has a guy whose job it is to lie directly to customers' faces.

While my wife and I were standing there we watched him do it to 3 other customers. I knew they were convincing boldfaced lies that he was just making up on the spot to deflect liability from the dealership and maximize the cost of repairs but there was literally nothing I could do about it when they were holding our car hostage.

They also tried to tell us that the wiring harness was frayed as a possible cause of why the car wouldn't accept the programming.

Reliability:
Good when it's taken care of and well maintained. Most issues will probably come from what past owners did to it.
Example: if the car has had water on the cooling system instead of antifreeze, you will have a lot of overheating issues.

When it comes to the abarth kits:
Don't use them unless you're planning on doing extensive work on the engine. Everyone you will meet in Portugal is gonna tell you that it will give you A LOT MORE POWER!!! But if your engine is in a nice state it will already go pretty well.

The motors of all 500s are made of forged components, if you‚Äôre looking at something stock with lower miles, adult owned with a service record, why not. They didn‚Äôt make many of these. I assume you‚Äôre looking at the manual transmission? Ensure the clutch engages properly, especially if higher miles. Take it for a test drive and ensure there‚Äôs no crazy vibrations or noises. 

I would highly suggest you get a pre purchase inspection and have the mechanic look at the turbo to check its seals and inspect for shaft play.  Don‚Äôt own one, yet, but have owned a ton of turbo cars, if the turbo is fine you‚Äôre probably in good shape, motor wise, as Fiat did over engineer the motor on these things and so long as you‚Äôre letting the motor fully warm up before getting on it and not absolutely redlining it all day every day you‚Äôre going to be fine.",Fiat

"I remember seeing a Fiat 500 break down once. I walked over and roadside assistance came quickly. I was of course interested to see what the problem was. Turns out it was low on oil, as it was starting to burn oil and the owner didn't notice yet. But what I found surprising was, that on that particular engine (not sure which it was) it would stop running when it didn't have oil pressure. So instead of destroying itself it just stops. Pretty neat. Another nice thing with the old 1.2 and 1.4 fire 8v engines is that they are non-interference, which means that the pistons don't hit the valves when the timing belt breaks. Another great design as opposed to many modern engines.

The newer Twinair and Multiair units are more complex and because of that somewhat less reliable. You really have to adhere to the correct oil spec and maintenance intervals on those. Other than that these cars are really good. In my country they are really popular, and usually that's saying something. Often popular means they are reliable and cheap to run.",Fiat
"Sounds like dealerships in Texas may be. I bought my fiat a few years back under the condition that the internal screen would be replaced.

Get there and there is no loaner, and service has no idea who I am. Fuck it I drop the car off and Uber home, they replace it. Then I realize a month later as the fob for my car dies, that the key was completely blank and useless. After dealing with service they told me they would have to take the key (and the fob) and ship it to Italy to be cut. Waited a month for that to be told they shipped it and it broke the machine so they‚Äôre shipping it back here to have their sister dealership do it. Surprise, broke the machine again, then claimed to bring in a locksmith or something to cut the key. You‚Äôll never believe what happened next: ‚Äúbroke the machine‚Äù again.

They ended up cutting me a check after 3-4 months for $500 to call it quits.

"I would say they probably work out to about average reliability, and some of the impracticality reputation is probably more down to it being a small quirky car. It's technically a Chrysler and it has the same pro/cons of feeling noticeably cheap, but often in a simplified way more than just cost cutting. I regularly find out from people with similar aged but fancier cars new and exciting ways that modern, increasingly dependent on computerization vehicles, can break and cost their owners money. The biggest repair expense I've had so far has been is the shitty infotainment headunit dying, and it's loss was so minor that I was able to replace it with a cd player without losing anything but adjusting the clock. 

TBH IME a lot of car reliability report inconsistency comes down to the difference between ""reliable with strict maintenance"" and ""reliable when neglected"", and you *cannot* get away with neglecting these cars.

There was a faulty wire up in the drivers side door that was shorting out the car and killed the BCM. It was $1800 to fix.

The reason it was twice was because the dealership mechanics didn‚Äôt know it was a faulty wire in the drivers door, thought just the BCM failed because that‚Äôs what came up on the diagnostic. They replaced it then before I left the parking lot I put on rear defrost and the same thing happened. It shorted out and killed the 2 day old BCM. 

They ordered another one (didn‚Äôt charge me) and my car was there like another week and a half until they traced all the wires and fixed it.",Fiat

"I had a 2nd gen. They're reliable on paper. Mine was sadly a lemon. Ignored red flags on purchase and ended up needing a new ECU, head gasket, catalytic converter, etc. 8 months after I bought it.

But if you buy one that's looked after and the maintenance history checks out they're great little runabouts. The 1.2 FIRE is a smooth, relatively quiet engine that's easy on gas. Trunk space is decent and 4 adults can fit in it relatively comfortably.

It's also fairly comfortable. I once did a 20 hour 1800km drive in it and came out fine.

3rd gen looks fun inside but that's it, underneath it's basically the same car. 

My advice would be a 2nd gen (169) Panda from 2011 or newer in mint condition and install a 2DIN touchscreen radio with Android Auto to really upgrade the interior.",Fiat

It is embarrassing how all the automotive industry in Europe need to make a poorer offer with little engines. 
The company that at not doing it ( mercedes) are going to pay more taxes on each gram of CO2 produced from an engine.
My suggestion is to buy a diesel with not so many km. ( 15/30 tkm) the old 1.6l diesel it is really durable, and it increasing the value ( I bought my in 2020, as used with 16tkm) and now has the same value that I paid if not more",Fiat

"I owned a 2015 500C in New England for 5 years. The car was fantastic, I never did anything besides regular maintenance. As for mods that help extend the life of the car, I would recommend the urethane hose kit from Eurocompulsion to replace the rubber engine lines that can rot quicker. As for the auto transmission, it is Japanese made and a 6 speed, that 1 extra gear made the world of difference for MPG and ease of driving. The other mod I did was the better BOV from Go Fast Bits, really livened up the response.

One other tip is to be sure to find a reliable mechanic that truly knows this car, I went for a routine oil change when I was out of town once and the shop overfilled the oil by a whole quart...almost torpedoed the whole engine. Other than that, I still miss the car to this day.",Fiat

"Sport was the design focus. You don‚Äôt have to be the fastest car on the planet to have a design focus pointed at power and handling. Miata is a sports car, old corvettes are sports cars, the abarth is a sports car, and all are far more fun than the Camry while simultaneously being slower. Don‚Äôt embarrass yourself as a car person to ignore the nuance between sport oriented design and 0-60 times on paper. The Abarth is far more sports car than a Camry ever will be, despite the Camry being *significantly* faster. 

The Abarth has a tiny, high strung turbo motor cranking out a high power to weight ratio and compression ratio. It‚Äôs not going to be as durable as a larger motor or a smaller untuned motor. It has tight suspension which will rattle plastic bits loose more often, and is more susceptible to pothole damage and such due to the lower ride height, even if only slightly. It‚Äôs designed as a sports car, and it‚Äôll wear like a sports car.",Fiat

The Volkswagens were sturdy, high quality materials within the interior and exterior and generally reliable, however were very prone to oil consumption and replacement parts were pricy in comparison to domestic models. I‚Äôve found the interior on my 500 very flimsy, plasticky and brittle. I‚Äôve had to fix door handles, glue arm rests and exterior trim pieces back on, however only ever done recommended maintenance on engine. Drivetrain is solid.
