Love it. Will you do other Lancia types?,lancia
"Nope sorry, just a fan",lancia
The transmission is likely the same as a Fiat 128?  Is the Zagato front wheel drive?,lancia
Wrong color,lancia
"Ah that's Lord March's Auerlia. Apparently his grandfather used to be a Lancia dealer, so he bought this one. Yup they can go for anything over ¬£100k. The Zagato models are really sought after.",lancia
Where can I find a high res copy of this image ?,lancia

I'm happy to hear that! I hope in the future to become a Thesis owner too,lancia
Chrysler 300 vs Buick Regal of course the 300 is better,lancia

"Lovely, should not be common in Japan?",lancia
"How incredible! Seeing the different Lancia's compared side by side is so fascinating. It's a chance to see that the technology does not move in a straight line, but weaves back and forth and around, giving each car a totally unique character. ",lancia
What's o.c. refer to?,lancia
I joint a forum online and got a lot of spare parts they way. The Lancia community are very helpful and welcoming,lancia
I have a motor and transaxle for a 54. I‚Äôm looking for info on where is a good place list forsale. Any recommendations?,lancia
"Two of my friends had these at different times. I always loved this car, I think they called it the  luxury version of the  X1/9 or something like that.",lancia
Sounds great! May I also suggest A112 autobianchi Abarth? Would be great!,lancia

"It starts and runs, just needs a new paintjob and a good cleaning!",lancia
Looks fantastic! And as Wikipedia rightly mentions ‚ÄúThe 2000 and 2000HF Coup√© ... do not suffer the corrosion problems associated with later generation Lancias‚Äù... ;-),lancia
"Great! Good luck you and your dad, I wish you many happy kilometers (or miles) with her! ",lancia
"Do that, its a really awesome car. The one in the video might be one (cuz its yellow).",lancia
"Peccato, in Lancia, qualcuno sapeva costruirle.

(What a pity, in Lancia, someone was capable of doing that.)",lancia
It's one of the various versions of the Appia bodied by Zagato. I think it is an Appia GTE but I'm not 100%. I'll poke into a book when I get home. ,lancia
If you have the time to constantly fiddle its worth every smile per mile,lancia
"Small cars have tiny profit margins, and there can be only so many hot hatchbacks. Lancia name doesn't have enough name rec for anything expensive. I'd love for an electric Delta someday but that's probably a pipe dream. 

The Epsilon I imagine they'll just let slowly die along with the brand, unfortunately.",lancia
Nice work man! :D,lancia
Yep. That will work.,lancia
"Fiat had been driving Lancia into the ground since they bought Alfa. And Marchionne may have saved the company, but he was terrible at managing brands.

Under Stellantis, there may be some hope.",lancia
Awesome job,lancia
Absolutely love these cars,lancia
Thanks for the suggestion! I will let him know about the website ,lancia

She's a beaty! Needs some attention but is worth the effort. Whats the condition of the engine?,lancia
Thanks,lancia
Thank you! He machined many of the parts himself and made custom tools for the job. Pretty proud of him! The mechanics are truly the unsung heroes of the classic car show world. ,lancia
As a Lancia owner - I love it :),lancia
Awesome in the true sense of the word.,lancia

Nuttttttt,lancia
Loving that font... did you design this?,lancia
Yes! I'm the guy in the video :-) I can't tell you that much but if you have any questions I'll ask my dad (who rebuilt and fitted the car from scratch)! It's a 1400cc 47years old car. Only downside is that it needs a new gearbox. Aside from that it's in prime racing condition :-D ,lancia
Thanks! i'll be sure to check it out.,lancia
"this one too. 037 stradale.

I have so much love for the scorpion/monte carlos. Is this you one?,lancia
Rebuilding the transmission plus remove and replace can be pretty costly. The rebuild might be $600- 800 US depending on parts needed. I‚Äôve never heard of one stuck in gear but that‚Äôs just me.  IF you can get it freed up I would recommend draining it and filling with Redline MTL. It has been known to work wonders on those Fiat FWD transmissions. This era of Lancia was built by Fiat.,lancia
Sold for a good price,lancia
"Thanks, bro",lancia
"A beautiful (albeit) boxy, machine :D",lancia
"Yeah, for me as a college student Lancia Thesis is definitely not a great choice, especially in Latvia, where Lancia Thesis is a super rare car. What is interesting is the fact that in an Italian creiglist for Lancia Thesis (2003) prices are starting from 1000‚Ç¨ but in Latvia Lancia Thesis (2003) goes for about 6000‚Ç¨ and we in Latvia usually have in a marketplace only about 3 listings with Lancia Thesis.",lancia
I am sure its a Appia GTE Zagato but not sure what series.,lancia
That's beautiful! :),lancia
Which one is the DeLorean? üòÅ,lancia
"Very nice little car. But as others said, finding one that isn't badly rusted is a big challenge in itself. Mechanics is fairly straightforward and the Lampredi twincam four is a jewel of an engine. Electronics is a constantly deteriorating thing on old cars, so that will keep you busy.

But the coupe is my favourite. Not as big of a sucker for the HPE like most people.",lancia
"It was restored very well, the yellow touch is perfect with the design of the car. ",lancia
Hands down coolest rally car ever,lancia
Still for sale. Have you looked at it?,lancia
"1. Engine wise, the Evo 1 had a bigger turbo. I'm pretty sure the Evo 1 has a cat. (Mine does). The Evo 2 high back seats are nicer than the Evo 1 trim. The other difference worth mentioning, Evo 1 has 15 inch alloys, Evo 2 16 inch. 
2. If you kept the original turbo it shouldn't be a problem. (Not sure why you want to change the turbo)
3. Again, if you keep the original parts, I can't see a problem. So you'll need some dry storage space.
4. It's a rally car. You can thrash it. This is what it was built for. Just be sensible, let the engine warm up prior to going wild. I also purchased a spare engine (from a Thema 16v) as the engine block is the same. Just in case.",lancia
It‚Äôs long gone now. I never bought it.,lancia
Mamma mia that's a shitty aspect ratio,lancia
While they are in Italy I hope they figure out how to produce a proper sports car before returning. ,lancia
Nice Evo 1,lancia
"Blame US Congress, had to do with regulated headlight height. 

European cars had another front end entirely",lancia
i want to drive it so bad,lancia
"Sorry, I still think the US front is rather hideous. If I had one, I would rebuild the front (and rear) pretty damn immediately to the slim and square euro spec. :P",lancia
Oh my goodness that is so cool! ,lancia
very much so! I love it,lancia
"I think we‚Äôre looking at the same car lol, I came here to ask the same question",lancia
Depends on what model but over 100k these days,lancia
"""and it was running perfectly 14 years ago""",lancia
"I was lucky enough to attend the Vernasca Silver Flag to get up and close with some of the most rare Group B and Race Cars from back in the best era of motorsport, it was truly incredible to witness!

In this video there's no fancy editing or music, just the raw sounds of the cars and the people in beautiful Castell'arquato in Northern Italy  
In this first installment, I walk you through the Pit Lane as the drivers prepare their cars for the HillClimb

There was an array of Stratos', Delta and 037's, the 037's in particular were fascinating as I am currently filming a ground-up build from a Montecarlo shell, see below

Thanks man cheers! ,lancia
"Sadly, I had to use images from a Google because in my country Latvia I know nobody who owns Lancia Thesis but at least some of the pictures which I used for my project were heavily edited by myself in a Photoshop.",lancia
"Thanks! Not mine, taking photos for a friend.",lancia
I read with that one model they're still outselling Alfa Romeo in Italy.,lancia
Integrale next pls!,lancia
"Which Japanese mad lad bought a Lancia tho. I thought only europeans were insane and masochist enough to buy Alfas/Lancias. (I want one, so much)",lancia
I've not heard of that edition. I'll have to Google it üòÄ,lancia
"It was in UK, just Google Lancia Beta forum. I'm not sure where you're based. I moved onto an Integrale Evo afterwards where there are a couple of communities. Lancia UK also had a club which sent out a magazine each month. Again, good for parts etc. ",lancia

Looks like a Compomotive TH2 17 inch upgrade,lancia
"I have a 3.0 V6 24v. Just spent the whole day chasing the damn fuel pump and fuel pump housing, good times. Anyways, it's a great car. The 2.0 has enough power to feel responsive and allow you to speed out of uncomfortable situations. Depending on the trim option you choose, these can be classy as fuck. The ride is comfortable, and beats a bunch anything Audi or Merc offer in the same era of production. 

Things to watch out for in my limited experience is the sound of the engine - ie. is there any knocking or unusual sounds. How it responds to throttle, and how it idles. Generally all the engines in Kappa are durable, but years of aggressive driving (and these cars are often driven aggresively) can do a number on them. 

Check the dashboard for unusual behavior, and watch the LCD display when you start the engine. Lastly, do not, under any circumstance buy the car without all the keys (one red master key, 3 black keys) and the emergency startup code card. ",lancia
Really why's that?,lancia
Looks like that's the correct answer thanks a bunch!,lancia

Very happy to see Lancia fans outside Italy! Beautiful car! ,lancia
Beautiful detail!,lancia
"Beautiful car. Beautiful shot. I'm pretty sure this is a 1600 (not  a 1,6)",lancia
"Awesome. I'm considering picking one up, but the consensus seems to be that they are notoriously unreliable? How's the maintenance been on these things?",lancia
This looks like a 16v with a few changes to look like an Evo.,lancia
They go around 15-20k depending on the engine and specs,lancia
I like it.,lancia
