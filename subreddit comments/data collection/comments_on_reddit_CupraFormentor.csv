"I had the exact same experience as you ... Waiting for an update from my company fleet services and chasing them to be told no progress had been made.  I got a call a week later and had the car a week after that. My old car also must've sensed what was going on because I got a slow puncture and engine warning light (fortunately both easily rectified).

It's worth the wait though!",CupraFormentor
Oh dang.. thanks!,CupraFormentor
"I get this a little - putting a dehumidifying pack under the front passenger seat has helped.

I think there is something odd about the way the door seals work - there is often condensation inside the door frames, but on the outside of the inner seal (which is good) - never had this on other cars.",CupraFormentor
"Hi! We have a VZ2 AWD and a 2 month old! You can fit a folded pram into the boot quite easily, BUT, space becomes much more limiting when taking the baby for a few nights away. Baby comes with SO much stuff and accessories, that we very quickly bought a roofbox because we couldn't get it all in the car. Now we're living the dream.. roofbox and boot are full, rest of the car is serene! 

And the roofbox looks pretty good...",CupraFormentor
Diesel engines are for long trips. Not for 4 km daily trips...,CupraFormentor
The switch in the driver's door to open the boot can also close the boot too if held for a short time. Only found that out recently.,CupraFormentor
Can’t really imagine where you see any sort of similarities,CupraFormentor
"Yes and no. In our company we have several cars from the group, Audi, VW, Seat/Cupra and Skoda. The CUPRA was the only one with THAT MUCH bugs and problems.

But I agree, most things have to be done via touchscreen, sometimes into several submenus. The whole interface is both ugly and cumbersome. The engine cover removed was a VAG thing for all the 2.0 TSI cars, so it’s not entirely Cupra fault.",CupraFormentor
"Yeah sorry, thats why I said if had the money",CupraFormentor
"Also problems with charging here. Have my car for almost a year now and up untill last month no problems at all. Now the light is yellow, and after authenticating when normally the charging starts, the light goed out and nothing happens anymore.
Some public chargers cause no problems the one day, but do cause issues the next way. Still waiting on diagnostics from the dealer",CupraFormentor
Front assist is just emergency brake if your about to hit a car or person. I dont get what u mean “looking for a parking spor withour hitting brake”,CupraFormentor
"this can occur if you mostly drive alone or without any load on the rear axle. if you break more often and harder it can go away (careful the breaking performance may vary, don’t do it in traffic) but to be honest I think it’s to much rust by now",CupraFormentor
"So they provided a new part? Did they mention anything, and give it the all clear?",CupraFormentor
"The fact is external influences are not warranty,  warranty is based on a manufacturing defect causing a failure of the component. They are right it's bumper off or skinny arms depending on what is in the way",CupraFormentor
I had similar issues and the dealer had to replace the whole center roof console.,CupraFormentor
USB C adapter,CupraFormentor
"I had the crackling noise from the speaker in the centre of the dash, then the Emergency Call/SOS Error. I also found that the GPS would basically lose itself, just randomly move around on the maps.

Check the infotainment software version, if it’s lower than version 1940 then I’d suggest contacting your dealership to ask them to update it. Once I had the 1940 update it seemed to resolve all of my issues.",CupraFormentor
"for number 1 - when you say ""car drive data widget"", do you mean on the infotainment centre screen, or on the digital dash behind the steering wheel ?

If you mean infotainment screen - there are 3 options : this drive, since last petrol refill, or long term. The 3 buttons are at the top of the screen

If you mean on the digital dash, in the left hand part of the screen - use the same left hand button that you use to change this screen, and it will scroll through the 3 options.",CupraFormentor
"We use different keys and it recognises the user automatically but for some reason it connects the previously used phone to CarPlay automatically instead of the user’s phone. I’m not even sure if it knows whose phone is which. To be honest it’s not a big deal for we can always sever the connection on the “intruding” phone temporarily.

My point as well was that. Although there is an issue with the infotainment system that we can talk about on forums it isn’t a dealbreaker.

Thanks for the tip anyway.",CupraFormentor
Mine spins the wheels in the dry just as much as the wet. I'm guessing it needs better tyres. But it would deffo benefit from 4 wheel drive.,CupraFormentor
Looks fantastic! Congrats!,CupraFormentor
"Quite small boot. A large stroller (britax) takes up most ot the space. A small one works fine. More legroom than my volvo v90 in the back.

Had a rs3 8v before my vz310. Different size but about the same mpg.",CupraFormentor
"The VZ5 is already fully equipped. You should only take a close look at the seats. The CUP seats are very uncomfortable on long journeys. The normal bucket seats are perfectly adequate.

Have fun on your test drives! If you like, I'd be interested to hear what you decide.",CupraFormentor
"OK great I will try that. I am noticing that the problem is in the morning, but its not going in the misuses like it was in your situation.",CupraFormentor
Mines grey but it’s been the same silver in the infotainment since I got it. Would love to be able to change it but alas it doesn’t seem possible,CupraFormentor
"What we need is someone with the purple light available to give us their code from Control Unit --> Adaptation --> Interior\_light\_hmi\_config, but no one seems willing lol.

I have seen a few people with H56 say that they get purple, the more believeable ones say that they can get it when they create a new user or factory reset their infotainment unit, the ones I don't fully believe are those that say they can choose it in their car because they only ever seem to provide a picture of their software/hardware version, or a picture of the purple option in their lighting settings, never a picture of both.

This is frustrating though, I'm not even bothered about the purple (okay that's a lie) I'm more bothered about how stupid the colour choice looks with two whites, two yellows and two oranges.",CupraFormentor
They will fit one free next time the car is in.,CupraFormentor
"At BMW you pay a surcharge for the M.
The VZ5 isn't cheap either, but it's cheaper to maintain. And parts will be around long enough. 

And it has the potential to retain a certain amount of value in a few years' time.",CupraFormentor
"I’ve worked in automotive for 10+ years so I know that finance is their bread and butter. At the end of the day, you have to pick contracts that work for you. 

Before I went in, I’d already created every scenario in my dealers PCP calculator so I knew roughly what I was expecting when I went in. (We don’t have Cupra in group so unfortunately for me I went external). 

My only advice is to be really clued up about it - I’d still rather pay a little interest than part with my cash. The monthly payments are the monthly payments - mine isn’t unreasonable for the vehicle and the deposit I put in, so I was happy with the deal. Less so the car after delivery but alas I can’t change it just yet - don’t really like much else on the market and the used market is very turbulent. 

I hope everything works out for you!",CupraFormentor
"Hi. Looks like it works, but I put one small humidifier from tesco for £5 in a boot, and 1 bag under driver seat and 1 bag under passenger seat 😅 No humidity at all now🤣",CupraFormentor
"Should have pushed to get sorted from day one, now they are going to say, well you were happy enough to drive 26,000 miles like that.
You will have to pay now.",CupraFormentor
"You’d do well to point out which configuration you want to buy. For example, my VZ2 will certainly have the power to tow, but I am not sure the base model 1.5 would with any grunt left over.",CupraFormentor
"Try the following: On your phone go to settings, search for Android Auto, uncheck 'start music automatically'",CupraFormentor
"Super helpful! The range management feature is cool, I like that one. 
Shame on the exhaust sound haha I swear even the 1.4 sounded nice, but maybe just the 2l up?!",CupraFormentor
You could it do yourself if go to the forums or ask here for the files/tutorial,CupraFormentor
Congratulations 🎉,CupraFormentor
"What did you do in the EQ?

The only way i made it sound decent, was to lower all the frequencies all the way down, except the subwoofer that was on max, and the 125Hz to +50%",CupraFormentor
Right!! So tiny... at least let me have more buttons or something,CupraFormentor
"Not according to this... [https://www.parkers.co.uk/cupra/formentor/suv-2020/20-tsi-245-vz1-5dr-dsg/specs/](https://www.parkers.co.uk/cupra/formentor/suv-2020/20-tsi-245-vz1-5dr-dsg/specs/)

They state the PHEV and 2.0 TSi in the VZ1 have identical bhp. Could be correct, or perhaps their website info is wrong? Looks like the official site says the 2.0l is 190ps.",CupraFormentor
Don’t ask don’t tell,CupraFormentor
"Hey!

You typically have 3 options at the end of PCP:

Refinance - refinance or pay off the OFP (optional final payment)

Swap the car in - the value of the car is worked out against the OFP and any positive equity is used against a new vehicle (new or used). Any negative equity must be paid off to equal the finance. The mileage will affect the value of the car, as the OFP is calculated on estimate vehicle mileage (potentially, higher OFP = fewer miles)

Hand the car back - this is the only time the mileage payment will come in - if you’ve taken a car out on 6k a year, over three years the car would be expected to be handed back with 18k miles. If the car is suddenly at 25k or 30k, then you’ll be billed the difference as per the contract. At 6 or 10p a mile, it’ll get expensive. It’s to discourage high mileage users taking out a cheap PCP to just hand the car back. 

I’m well over my mileage on mine (18 months into a 4 year contract, 12k a year on the contract and I’m averaging 15k a year). It won’t matter to me as I’ll swap the car before then, but I won’t be penalised for going over the mileage - it just affects the value of the car. 

I hope this helps - happy to explain further should you want me to :)",CupraFormentor

"There isn’t any way to do this except probably physically digging into the car and unplugging it somewhere. I have the same issue, but I just put my phone face down. My phone case has a small lip on front so it does not touch the surface and on top of that I got a screen protector. That charger is a joke.",CupraFormentor
"Yep, I get a “Cupra deactivated services” email every time the head unit can’t find my profile, so pretty frequently.

I just keep on going. Still. Haha.",CupraFormentor
Thanks guys,CupraFormentor
It is more exclusive. That was also a good point for me. But it sells very poorly. The price has completely collapsed.,CupraFormentor
"Dealer doesn't have time, nor seems to care enough before end of February. By that time I will either have electrical issues, or molt in the car. Let's see what comes first. 

It ain't my own as it is a company car so I don't care to much, but it's the lart vw product for the coming years. That im sure of.. 

Also had the central light / roof panel replaced because it wasn't working at all. Couldn't control the roof, nor the interior lights.",CupraFormentor
Much of the Cupra charm is that it reminds me of a 90’s General Motors product.,CupraFormentor

"I think I will sell a car, very sad because it looks stunning",CupraFormentor
"I have a 190 4 drive. Yes it can go rather well in sport mode. Diesel wouldn’t like the short journey if my previous diesel cars are anything to go by. Even the petrols not too happy doing short trips you notice average consumption will drop, plus it’s best to switch off the stop start as that will do the battery a mischief. If I do a few short trips I always take it for a fast run over a larger distance regularly to keep things clean and working",CupraFormentor
"This looks great, and very clever. Anyone got any experience with having the rear cam too?",CupraFormentor

"Hi Kasper,  
Sweden here - just across the pond! The car is actually painted at a professional shop. I did the rear, entire front and the sides (all things that were silver became black). It was about  €1500 (15 000 sek)

So if you come over and do it in Sweden, you probably will be paying less since our currency is not as powerful as DKK -\_-",CupraFormentor
"In Italy yes, mine came with it as standard",CupraFormentor
"From what I'm seeing in the market, I can get an M340i 1-2 years older or with a bit higher miles for as much as the VZ5 which is why I'm cross-shopping them. I assume resale will be similar 5 or so years down the line when all of these interesting ICE cars will be quite desireable.


Interesting to note BMW quality is substantially higher than VAG, never owned a BMW before but I have had mostly positive experiences with VAG.",CupraFormentor

"I drove my Polo 6 GTI (same motorblock) over 100.000km only on 102 ultimate, always felt like new, but I‘d say that‘s only subjective
Go for the minimum, that is suggested if you wan‘t to save cost, go over if you wan‘t more power and longevity",CupraFormentor
Typical on mine it’s been worse since the update. I wanted to reject it but the price offered was derisory. Most unreliable vehicle ever and I’ve had Italian motorcycles in the 70’s! Only good point is it’s looks!,CupraFormentor

"On the Formentor it looks awful with the cladding, but that’s subjective.

"Not sure what the issue here... condensation is normal in the exhaust and has nothing to do with age or mileage, it's the temperature difference.......

Beats is bad in the Formentor. Don’t expect Much. This has been discussed several times in this sub and most people agree it’s barely better than stock speakers and I can confirm that for my former VZ.,CupraFormentor
I just was on appointment with my dealer due to grinding sound (11k km). They said it's normal wear and also this part is on warranty for 10k km or 6 months. I have pretty old Opel Meriva and this never happened there so I'm kinda upset that I have to deal with this sound in my brand new car.,CupraFormentor
"Once the dealership also sent me home because the diagnostic platform was down, so maybe was a general outage.

What do you mean with “a new control unit”? Are you waiting for a new OCU (Online Control Unit)? Did they decide this component is faulty and needs to be replaced?",CupraFormentor
"Actually, a car with a panoramic roof should be as solid as one without it as they reinforce some parts to not lose rigidity, the only thing is that it weighs more so the centre of gravity goes up and makes the handling a little bit worse (most people won't be able to notice it) 

I would recommend if your car is cracking too much to maybe call or go to the dealer to check everything is all right because mine doesn't make any noise compared to my last formentor wich has no panoramic roof.",CupraFormentor

"  Electric motor will help you with acceleration at higher speeds while maintaining a steady speed will be left to the petrol engine. 

  It may even start to charge the battery when the petrol engine is running alone. You will actually have some say about that.

  Also you may actually use the electric motor only at higher speed as well. It’s just not the most economical option unless you get to charge the car for free. I use mine electric only at all speeds when commuting to work for I get free electricity from my employer.",CupraFormentor

"I’ve got a 190 4drive and simply put is the most unreliable vehicle I’ve ever owned. At present it’s in the garage…second one I’ve tried, and essentially nothings been done in the nearly two weeks they’ve had it. Problems are all the usual ones plus a couple of others but all in one car. I’ve only done 3000 miles in nearly 8 months of ownership! Trying to get rid of it I’ve only been offered £13000 less than a paid for it….  But it does look good.",CupraFormentor
"I don't think the way you charge it affects its range.

In my case, I only charge it in my home socket (schuko) and usually have 60+ km of range (more than announced)

Of course that the effetive range is never what the display says. For bad and good. Once it said Zero km range and still managed to drive 4 km on EV mode.

One thing that hugely affects the range is the temperature. Usually, my consumption is around 16 Kv/100km. On really cold days, if I turn on the heating and steering wheel heater, it pumps up to 30+ kV/100km. I get less than half the expected range.",CupraFormentor
"It's really bad.

"The VZ 4 wheel drive or normal 2.0 TSi with 4 wheel drive such as the 2.0 TDi with 4drive have the DQ381. Its a 4drive transmission.

The 1.5 TSi only comes with raw FWD and therefore needs another transmission. VW puts DQ200 in use for these engines because the maximum torque limit is 250nm on those transmissions and all those smaller engines below 2 litres fulfill this requirement. The problem is the DQ200 is a dry clutch transmission which is the reason why its cheaper to manufacture but also less reliable for anything above 250nm and have apparently a higher wear level on the clutch with weird symptoms.",CupraFormentor

When I drive from 100-0% the best I've ever gotten was 41km at 2°C. When I do that in smaller steps e.g . 3km at a time I get about 15 km pure electrical at the same temp. Recently I parked the car with 5% left. It got a little warmer and suddenly I had 9%. So the temperature and whether you use heating has a massive influence on the range. I wouldn't trust the estimations either.,CupraFormentor

Let me guess, this is your first hybrid/electric vehicle? If you drive casually all the time, your brakes will never activate since it will all be regenerative braking with the electric motor.

"Same here. So far, the steering wheel has been replaced and the engine control unit software has been updated. There are still warning lights, but now they have some logic. Now the lights have only come on when the weather is bad and the radar has been snowy or wet. This seems to be some kind of feature in this car and apparently also in other VAG group cars.

"Fuel Consumption is not negotiable. If you want to drive this car, you need to earn it in the first place. About Oil Change I would stick with a fixed intervall of 12 thousand kilometres or 7500 miles for the life quality of your Engine and Timing Chain.

If you want to move it within city drive with about 2000-2500rpm with manual gear mode, otherwise its usual for VW AG Engines to have weak ass oil pumps. So it pumps properly the oil for your engine and gets it warm and cozy for the parts.

Also check if this car is really what you want, a 4WD VAG Performance vehicle can get really boring really quickly, check it out or rent it for 1 or 2 days maybe, so it won't be a purchase failure leading to value loss and money loss in the first place.",CupraFormentor

"That's what I thought too. But the Formentor as a concept is to offer people an attractive looking car with a priority on performance and value. So that's why even on the higher trims, you don't get an electric passenger seat, or gas struts for the bonnet, or faster AC charging for the Hybrids. Or a washer fluid detector, for that matter.

This is why the car was £40k new rather than £50k - they made some compromises in places where they thought the customer would either not notice or not care.",CupraFormentor

"Definitely a looker! Electrical problems are a big fail. Like people have said lots don’t have issues. Mine stem from the infotainment system, lots have had it replaced and it’s been ok from then on. The other issue appears to be related to the steering wheel. It may be trapped wires dodgy connections but lots of functions‘hiccup’ on full lock! Again some have had this replaced under warranty. 
I find the handlings no where as good as my old Subaru and similarly nor is the all wheel drive. Engine power, comfort are definitely better. It may well be poor initial setup causing the problems, my Subaru Eyesight system was lethal until it got set up by the top electrician. It would slam on the brakes if it ‘saw’ signs, people etc on corners junctions and the like. Trouble here it was computer initiation so ABS and all other systems worked to stop it as fast as possible such fun. At least this one doesn’t do that since they appear to be useless (or perhaps not set up?)

"Happy VZ 310hp owner here. 

Bought the car brand new, did my first service when it hit 1000km in official service which cost only 200€. 

Pros: delivers a lot of joy on all terrains, especially wet asphalt and snow, haven’t tested it yet for more serious off-road but will try it out soon. Took all the extras except panorama and full leather seats as buckets tend to become really warm when it’s summer. Infotainment runs on 1940 and haven’t had any problems with that. Looks awesome and the pops & bangs only make more sweet.

Cons: my previous BMW 5 series was more silent in terms of road noise and axle. Felt more solid than Cupra. Keyless access unlocking stopped working when it got past -10 degrees, locking works flawlessly. Now sudden warm winds came, it’s between 5 to -6 in the nights and they work again. Service said they’re waiting for a solution from the maker and change them under warranty. Wireless charger tries to melt my iPhone and somehow it connects more early the full link to android but can be swapped easily. No lighting for some buttons but those are easily accessible on infotainment and steering wheel. 

Long story short: it has its flaws but starting price is just too damn sweet to ignore it. It’s rare on the streets and delivers joy, the exact reason I bought the car.",CupraFormentor

People are in favor of the 340 because it's a BMW. Cupra is new on the market. For most people it's still just a Seat (which is not a bad thing). 

The handling is not really a problem. Almost everything is done via the steering wheel. I don't mind the touchscreen. The only thing that's stupid is that the buttons aren't illuminated. 

That's exactly the point. The slushbox is soft as butter. With the DSG, you can feel the gear changes. If you like that, it's ok. You just have to know it. 

And what I haven't mentioned yet, but of course the main argument for me: the 5 cylinder. This engine is a dream. I haven't needed a drop of oil in 5000 km so far. And it has incredible tunning potential. The 400hp is just the start.

What's certain is that in 12 years i never had A SINGLE PROBLEM with the interior of my A4, as opposed to the Formentor which threw new stuff at me once every 2-3 months.

"Today, -10°C where I'm at. I have the same issue. Drove a bit and the issue went away without me doing anything. 

I had the same issue with my 2018 Leon and I can only imagine that it is the same with any other car that has a camera.",CupraFormentor

"I got that, straight on eBay for £150",CupraFormentor
"Oh ok, that sounds good. I'll test drive both but I'm used to smaller engine cars so I reckon 1.5 will be fine. My current car is 0.9 🤣 I hate it though. I previously had a 1.6 diesel and loved it but sadly, ULEZ means I can no longer have a diesel car.",CupraFormentor
"I have the same. For me it comes from Rear right interior light, haven’t solved it yet",CupraFormentor

"Definitely, they always caught my eye! Perfect, thanks!",CupraFormentor
"I think that’s normal and yeah it takes a while to get used to the break pedal response in various modes. What happens is that usually when breaking, the engine is disengaged and even turned off, so the breaking is smooth. However, for few minutes after starting up the engine, the control software won’t turn it off to reach the operational temperature. In this mode, the engine is always engaged when breaking (unless stopping still) and that results in a different breaking pedal response. The transmission may swich gears during breaking and that’s what you may feel as a sudden change in the breaking.",CupraFormentor
Had to pull over. Turn off and on the car to reset the lights,CupraFormentor
Could it be the clutch disengaging? Sometimes it is noticeable as you are losing the engine braking,CupraFormentor
Thank you dude for saving my time trying to explain my point! You did way better than I would,CupraFormentor
"Ask Carvago then, they will ask the dealer for details about equipment.",CupraFormentor
Main case of this is carpet mats + wet feet + not having heating on floor for the mats to dry before Leaving car. Best fix for this are rubber mats,CupraFormentor
I've been waiting since March for mine from work.,CupraFormentor
"Yes, it was within warranty when I had it sorted out. Since then the software crashes have stopped, the front sensors are working normally as well as the auto update working again.",CupraFormentor
"Not an HV owner, but I had similar issue on petrol Formentor - car won’t start, and throwing lots and lots of errors. 
Happened on -20C temps usually. 

Solution that worked for me - instead of “clicking” the engine start button, just hold it for a couple of secs and car starts allright.",CupraFormentor
"My Formentor has this issue. Overhead 'buttons' either don't work or randomly activate lights, and make calls to Cupra Assist/ Customer Support. Have recorded and sent to dealer and awaiting a response. Only had the car 5 days (new to me, 1 year old, bought from a Cupra dealer).",CupraFormentor
Thank you i will check it out.,CupraFormentor
7 seaters are becoming rare. The new Tiguan isn‘t available as a 7 seater (yet) and the old one has the bad VW stearing wheel…,CupraFormentor

Before stage one i tanked 95 e5 but only when i drive long distances when i drived localy only 98. After stage only 98.,CupraFormentor
Looks awesome! What brand wheels are these?,CupraFormentor
Thanks for the info!,CupraFormentor
"Guess so! I saw a random article about the recalls, but it lead to an Australian site. Couldn't find anything for Germany, but glad there's a thread here already - wasn't sure how to check which cars were affected.",CupraFormentor
"I'm using Cupra Connect but that's not the problem. Today while driving my airflow went crazy again. The cold air began to blow strongly, then weaker, then strong again, then warmed and cooled. At the same time, none of the shutdown buttons worked.",CupraFormentor
It has to go to the dealership and be prepared for delivery. Mine was delivered to a port 5 mins from my home then it was sent down to London to be prepared and then driven back up to me. It took 14 days from arrival at port to receiving it. Hope this helps enjoy the car when you get it.,CupraFormentor
"It shows the same base images for every car. I have a white Formentor with black seats but it shows a grey car with the blue VZ5 seats (seat heating menu). 

Cupra should concentrate on getting the system stable before they waste any time on optical gimmicks (it’s not a Tesla)... Just my opinion",CupraFormentor
"I do the same, but few times was out of country and had to fill with 95 and did get the fuel pressure error (restarting the car fixed it). Not sure if it was coincidence or not, but I’ll stick with 98/100.",CupraFormentor
"I paid 27,000 for mine.  I think it all depends on where you buy it.  I searched within a 100 km radius and found it.  If I understand correctly, it's a 2021 model.",CupraFormentor
"I went there first, the lady I was talking to was good really. Though I ended up going via Carwow and bought mine from Marshall’s who matched an Arnold Clarke offer.

Listers have been friendly and helpful enough whenever I’ve been in. My only real issue with them was that the notes they’d been adding to the system were really very basic, which didn’t reflect the issues I’d taken the car in for. So when Cupra CS were ‘investigating’ there was no real record from the dealer.",CupraFormentor
"That's the thing, M and M-lite BMWs are pretty common where I live, while I've seen maybe one VZ5 ever. I love the design of the Formentor and owning something unique is appealing, I am a little concerned about what this may mean for future parts availability and maintenance costs though.",CupraFormentor
My 1.4L v1 PHEV doesn't have a socket in the boot... that i know off atleast,CupraFormentor
"I've had my used VZ2 310 for less than two weeks, and it is back in the garage today with an oil sensor fault. The EA888 may be a good and supposedly proven engine, but the gen 4 seems really flakey. 

The infotainment system can be a disaster, and most dealers won't seem to consider updating to the less buggy versions unless it is A) Recalled or B) Booked in for diagnostics for a specific issue. As people say, 1940 onwards fixes a lot of those issues. 

Love the car though... Comfortable, fun to drive, nice dash, well equipped; it fits perfectly between a bigger SUV car and a hot hatch. Dealers can be questionable though, so try to find a good one.",CupraFormentor
"Becasue I had the vehicle checked through carvago car audit and there they found out that it doesn't even have blind spot monitoring, so I am not sure now.",CupraFormentor
"Yeah, its not THAT bad, was just wondering.

And the only other thing that botters me , is the slight miscentered steeringwheel, anybody knows if it is Electric, or that i can just get it alligned at tyrecentre",CupraFormentor
Got same spec phev with 900 km on it and the brakes have grinding noise since the beginning also. Thats one and second probably also the regenerative braking doesnt help either,CupraFormentor
Module needs replacement its a known issue,CupraFormentor
"I tried Racechip once in a Mini GP and it was awesome, I’d use it without a hesitation but if you can buy JB4 I’d rather use it because it allows you to custom tune and it is quite safe. 

Both are safe, fairly cheap and very easy to install/uninstall. It’s a no brainer if you don’t want your warranty voided. 

This cars have so much potential regarding tuning that is a tragedy to see one in stock condition.",CupraFormentor

"Had my V1 hybrid a year - flawless, solid car on a proven VAG platform.

Good value cars, can 100% recommend.",CupraFormentor
"For me the updates just keep coming over the air, wouldn't really worry about having to take the car to the dealer or installing the updates yourself. Atleast that's how it's been for me:",CupraFormentor
"We had a Polo and a Tiguan, now it’s only the Tiguan, but at least the Formentor is still VAG, so I‘ll gave the sign a pass",CupraFormentor
"It surely is up to you. I would however choose the weaker/cheaper option. It’s nice to have a strong car 2% of the time. Otherwise strength is just an additional risk factor. 98% of the time drivers just chill in traffic anyway. Nothing we can do about it.

It will not be down to the city’s parking or the rest of the traffic. It’s that confidence in yourself that will make you pay the “tuition fee”. However as long you keep your cool and patience nothing actual bad should happen whatever car you choose.",CupraFormentor
"I think it's worth having in the range. I have that version. For me I didn't want something that couldn't pull its own weight, but didn't want to get the VZ as realistically I didn't need that power or gas usage. I know there will be others thinking the same, the hybrid struggles in comparison and its noticeable.",CupraFormentor
"Yes it was very stressful for my, this is my first expensive car, and when this things started comes out on second day I was so angry and stressed 😅 And local cupra dealer had available appointments only in a next 2-3 months.",CupraFormentor

I would suggest to ignore your electricity vendor app and schedule the car to load during off peak in the Cupra connect,CupraFormentor
"Yes, I second that. One of the known issues",CupraFormentor
It seems too much in my opinion. Should be an easy replacement under warranty. Otherwise the price is around 900 euro,CupraFormentor
Done that,CupraFormentor
"Look at the steering wheel, left side, bottom left most button, looks like a car with 3 lines, it's the distance control between you and car in front. Also, look at front of car, middle under the grill, a black square panel, it's the radar.",CupraFormentor
Fair enough! I've got a heat map protection recall which I was able to book in as it seemed urgent enough,CupraFormentor

"Nope, both L and R mirrors have it, in mine anyway!",CupraFormentor
"Mines been a disaster since I got it in July. All your infotainment system problems and more. It actually got worse with 1940! Cruise control, wipers, forward assist, manoeuvre braking, sat nav have all been big problems and still are. Doors either refuse to lock at all or don’t unlock! Talking to technical they think it’s all infotainment system related.
There’s a loud clunk from the rear near side and handling is rather iffy. Cupra said to get the supplying dealer to let me reject it but it was a rubbish offer. It goes in on the 23rd of this month to another dealer to see if it can be fixed!
Performance is good it looks great but….most unreliable vehicle I’ve ever had I only managed 2500 miles since July! I did that in a month with the former Range Rover and Subaru - whose electrics and safety systems were light years ahead.  We await that service!",CupraFormentor
"Absolutely. I’d take your time, it’s a big purchase. An hour is a long way to travel if there is an issue but for your sake I hope they’ve rectified them by now. Fortunately, my local dealer is about 3 miles/10 mins away, and they know me quite well by now 😅

I’d make sure before you take delivery (should you proceed) that it’s as up to date as it can be. Mine has had the update but it’s still not perfect (it doesn’t remember my profile, it’s still glitchy, slow etc, and the satnav isn’t always great) but the car to drive is beautiful and it turns heads everywhere I go.",CupraFormentor
The full black looks awesome.,CupraFormentor
Yh i figured this is meant for the highway haha. Even the guy at the dealership said that fuel figure can’t be right and may need to be resetted.,CupraFormentor
"That's lovely, I love the black details",CupraFormentor
"Kind of a similar situation here: I had an 2020 Ibiza dsg 115hp for 18 months before moving to Formentor 1.5 Dsg V2. It's been 22 months now, I got it 2 weeks after manufacture. No issues with software, some minor stuff only, disappear after restart. 

Exterior: enough said
Interior: love the minimal environment, I need lights on the a/c controls though.
Driving: superb, I'd love the 310hp (I have driven it) but not for every day driving, gas consumption would be too much. Love the ACC, makes long distance highway destinations very relaxing. 

The hp/kgr ratio for the Ibiza Vs the Cupra is almost similar. I feel that some times I want to change gear to a lower one especially after 100kmh if I want to overtake. 7th gear is long enough, I've reached 215kmh with the Cupra, 204 with the Ibiza.
Consumption heavily depends on your average speed. If you play it smart on D mode, you might get 5-6lt/100km. If your leg is heavy, you can reach 9lt. 

What I would change is +40more hp, the non-existent illumination on the a/c controls and the sometimes sluggish gearbox on low speeds and gears. Also I would love a sunroof but I didn't want to wait for it. 

I miss the Ibiza sometimes tbh, especially in city driving. But overall the Cupra is one of the best cars I've driven. The new 2024 version is ironically worse in appearance, seems Cupra nailed the first iteration of their SUV. 

My next car would be something even more sporty, Alfa Romeo Giulia, a BMW 4 series, you get me. 

Enjoy it.",CupraFormentor
"That would be absolutely great! I had a Leon before. I only switched because of the engine.

But it would be too close to the RS3 for Audi. The Formentor is practically an RS3 already.

It's a miracle that this engine even exists outside the Audi family.",CupraFormentor

Glad you enjoy it and it really treats you well! Wish you lots more of happy kilometers!,CupraFormentor
Why do you think it sounds better on paper?,CupraFormentor
"We initially though blind spot is not there since usually it's on mirror, however formentor has it on the indoor light that lights up on the sides when blind spot is detected. Don't you have it? Check some YouTube videos for it, we were also shocked at first but then realized that it's that 😀 we have Vz3.",CupraFormentor
Remove the fuse?,CupraFormentor
"You can do it yourself... engine & ignition off, on level ground, wait for a few minutes for the oil to settle if you just turned the engine off, check the dip stick and add 250ml at a time until you're at the max or just below.

"1940 is the current software level as of today, take it to the dealer or risk breaking the 5F control unit that could be upto £3,000. And if you cook the unit it will be dead trust me I've paid the price as a dealer",CupraFormentor
Yeah same here. Also no clue where to fix that.,CupraFormentor
SEATBELT,CupraFormentor
Too bad. I guess I don't have any issues if I don't use any features then...,CupraFormentor
Congrats! Which version is?,CupraFormentor
"Hello there, i do understand your point of vieuw and i agree with it. But i do think that if you but the car for 40K and fuel and repairs/maintanance you should have 100k in the bank at least and im not joking. You dont buy this car to drive like a grandma ( nothing wrong with that but you get the point ). You are looking at 10+ liters per 100k/m easily. The more power and the more technical things it has the more it will cost to keep it running. I would estimate the car will cost you between 5-8k a year depending how many KMs you would drive/insurence and all that stuff",CupraFormentor
More power and just the overall BMW build quality and chassis. VAG cant compare to BMW in my eyes in general.,CupraFormentor
"It's hybrid... 95% the time it's in full EV.

The garage door makes more noise than the car.... lol",CupraFormentor
"Ah there must be a problem with mine then, it was just coming out of my phone. I'll have a play around and see if I can fix it",CupraFormentor
"Also forgot to say, more often then not, my 20 mile commute is entirely EV, Save for the odd cold day where the hybrid kicks in for the last few miles, 3 miles of that is motorway.",CupraFormentor
"No idea, but I want one 😏; just the wife to convince now 😂",CupraFormentor
"I bought mine with 20,000 km.  I rarely have problems, the camera is dirty every now and then, acc is switched off every now and then due to the system, but it often works again after 5 minutes.  Otherwise no problems.",CupraFormentor
"Snap! Picked our Graphene Grey V2 1.5 DSG up in December. 

I got a boot liner and some faraday key bags off Amazon straight away. 

Boot liner is great, good for dog, wellies, bags of stuff from B&Q/Wickes etc. stops pram scratching the inside. 

Faraday bags because thieves target new SUV’s. They only need to be within a few yards of your keys to scan them and drive off. Faraday bags stop a signal being found and they can’t pinch the car. 

It drinks a lot of fuel when you first get it, especially on smaller trips, this gets better as the engine loosens up. Don’t be alarmed. I started on 18-23mpg, then around 28-35mpg after a month or so, now I’m on 40-42mpg and I’m at around 2000 miles on the clock. It’s still very thirsty in Sport mode but we’ve gotta have some fun every now and then! Enjoy!",CupraFormentor
that too,CupraFormentor
"So would you say it's beginner friendly?

The only real experience with Cupras that I've had is my current driving school car, the 4x4 2.0 TDI Formentor. It pulls relatively hard for such a car, but then again I've got minimal experience and even a Smart feels like an F1 car to me. The price isn't a big deal-breaker for me since my mom has a high salary, so she will thankfully finance it for me. I'm still looking to keep it under 30k€ since it is my first car after all.",CupraFormentor
I already send an email to the dealer asking for help to unlock. Lets see the result :) maybe on monday. thanks guys.,CupraFormentor
I'm forced to wonder how many pennies they saved not having that. Absolute nonsense.,CupraFormentor
I think the biggest update is going to be the infotainment (same as the electric cars) and the controls below being illuminated.,CupraFormentor
"Hey there.

1. if I remember correctly there is a setting about the AC in „last state“ or „always on“.
Will check if I’m back at the car in 2h.
2. True and you can’t really change that, only minimise the „impact“:
- turn down the initial volume as far as possible
- always use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. For some reason most of the time it does not resume from there.
3. it does that on its own after a few seconds. 
(The horizontal lines on your cruise control icon will disappear) AFAIK there is no way to manually do that.

"Just done some reading up, the hybrids are generally still able to give you the transient boost when low battery. 

Still, it’s limp mode and until you get enough juice, you’re now driving the standard VW golf engine and to me thats jarring enough to say i’ll take the 2L 190hp which at no point has performance hinderance.

"Ah just realised you meant general heating. No other hearing controls on the steering wheel. The climate control has all the options, if you’re in CarPlay it takes 2 clicks to open the heating controls. There are physical buttons but they’re not backlight so hard to use in the dark.

I'm familiar with the existence of devices that can tamper with or roll back the odometer. If I were to contemplate purchasing a Cupra with manipulated mileage, I'd like to grasp the potential consequences. What damages should I be watchful for, if any? The prices on the website are notably striking—26k for a fully-loaded Cupra with just 30k miles. This has prompted me to seek opinions from others about their experiences with this car, as varied mileages seem to contribute to different stories that may unveil the truth.",CupraFormentor

"It's not a bad car, but there are a few quirks. 

Both screens (the main one and the digital speedo) have limited info they can display at the time and the font is tiny. For example, you can't have engine temperature displayed unless you select that specific view. But then this means, that you don't see your fuel range until you ""scroll"" and re-arrange it again with no temps being displayed at all.As for the main screen... I feel like Peugeot has it thought out a bit better to be honest where you have physical buttons for each submenu. And the fm radio menu is an absolute joke, it goes into ""full screen"" mode from your favorites/presets list on it's own and there's nothing you can do about it. The full screen is basically taken up by 3 buttons: mute/next/previous. No idea why they made it this way, just leave the damn list where I can easily select individual exact fm stations without having to scan through every single one of them lol. If I wanted to go to the ""next"" one I can use a button on the steering wheel. 

And don't even get me started on the manual frequency change to the next station independently of your presets/favorites which seems to be hidden on purpose. 🤣

"No pops and bangs. It's a 1,4 engine . But I like silence.
You can set the armrest position both horizontally and vertically 
If you use two fingers at once on the temp slider it will turn on seat heating.
If you press acceleration to the floor it will default to hybrid and start the engine
The best tip for range is to have the car pre heated while charging.  You can set departure times and the car will manage itself.
On long runs you can use built-in sat nav with range management enabled",CupraFormentor
Sounds like the phev would be best for you. In 4km the engine will never warm up properly which can cause carbon buildup. No problems when you charge regularly and drive with electricity. For the longer trips you still have the gas engine.,CupraFormentor

Until 200 km/h it also still handles nicely, but after that you start to feel the height of the car. I can imagine the VZ5 performs better at 200+ with better suspension and lower height. Though the question is how often can you actually drive that fast. I have a daily route where i can easily do that on a longer strip of Autobahn, but mostly cruise at 170 ish. I know a lot of people that can’t really go that fast on their usual routes and they opt for lower hp dailies and have some fun cars that are driven on tracks.",CupraFormentor

I truly wish I’d been told that the car wouldn’t read my iPod though, it may well have been enough to stop me buying (hindsight is beautiful, and if I knew what I know now about the car I would have never swapped the Golf in anyway!)

"The charger you are using could have a load balancer if its at a site where there are multiple chargers. Your right the three pin plug takes 5 hours and on a mains fixed charger it should be approximately 3.5 hours. Remember these are not ""chargers"" but simply modules as the charger is in the car and on PHEV its single phase. If it is taking 8 hours for a full charge you may have an issue with a module balancing or the SX6 may have an issue. I would monitor and keep a record of the actual charge times a values charged and if they are all long times contact your SEAT dealer and ask for the charge rate to be checked.

Paid services (even from Finnish authority Traficom) provide the entire history of the vehicle including current owner information with an instant lookup. It's kinda relevant data, especially if you need to contact the owner of a car that you witness for instance crashing into yours etc or more commonly if you are planning to purchase said vehicle.

"Big problem with Cupra and no doubt many other companies is they rely on diagnostics and what the ‘book’ says on recalls. Among the myriad of problems mine has is a loud clunk left near side rear. The garage (I’ve tried 2 so far) said it’s not in the VIN range so it’s not bearings. The car is about 1-2 weeks after the recall ceased. Therefore no problem. Could it be a dodgy bearing? I don’t know because no one will remove the wheel because the paperwork says no.
It’s in the garage again for all its other issues - taken away on a low loader. Cupra UK is involved and there’s talk of them contacting the factory.  They supplied a courtesy car….a Volvo!",CupraFormentor

Cruise control worked once next time using buttons it accelerated rather than slowed down. OMG I pressed the wrong button tried again but no I’d used the decelerate one. OK turn off CC..the ***** car engine switched off. Motorway, outside lane at ‘speed’ . Turned CC on again engine started. And I slowed down using brakes. Since then it’s not worked whatsoever.

The only exterior problem with Formentor is that it has grey color moldings, arcs, front and back elements, also front grille, don't suit any color Formentor, besides grey, as it matches the best.

For example I have black formentor and with those grey elements, it just looks horrible... I'm forced to wrap my car either fully or at least just those grey elements :D I believe that if those grey elements would be gloss black it would suit perfectly fine with any car color, but it's just my thoughts.

However, considering the substantial depreciation and the costs involved, it's practical to be informed about all aspects of ownership, including fuel consumption. The car, now priced at 40 grand, has depreciated about 30 grand in just a year or two with a mileage of up to 30,000 km. Given this significant depreciation, being mindful of ongoing costs doesn't necessarily mean I shouldn't buy the car.

"I have a love/hate relationship with mine... 

I own a VZ2 310 and it is brilliant on some days, but near the worst car I have ever owned on others; second to a disastrous Peugeot 208 GTi that spent 9 months out of 36 in the garage. 

The car itself is lovely though, with a comfortable spacious interior and good design, it is just let down by software. I think software really makes or breaks these cars, and while there are regular updates, dealers verge from reluctance to near refusal to complete them. I get the impression that they don't get reimbursed for the time spent.

I was also shocked to find out that, according to a reputable  main dealer chain, updates are only free for the first 3 years and only for the original user; apparently if you are the second user, or you bought their extended warranty, updates become chargeable... which is just utterly bonkers given how poor the software can be.

Beyond that, the car always puts a smile on my face and gives me 85% of the fun, compared to my previous i30N, but none of the drawbacks. Big boot, plenty of passenger space, good driving manners (even if the gearbox is a bit dense in 'D'), it is an excellent all round car.",CupraFormentor

I'm very lucky because my mom's the one who pitched the idea to get a newer car for 30k€ or so. She will most likely cover the cost for the first year or two until I get up on my legs financially. I plan to mostly drive it in Eco mode for 3 reasons. 1. Save fuel duh 2. Get to know the car and also reduce my risk of accidents or crashes 3. I don't wanna cause any trouble in my learner period, but also partially because I'm not a very adrenaline-loving driver. I love slower drives especially across backroads and the countryside. My motorcycle does the speed part for me.",CupraFormentor
Do you have a link for the charging pad and the light?,CupraFormentor
"Yeah, the Magnetic Tech is surprisingly good on Formentor. It reflects the surroundings, so it becomes blueish or greenish in various environments and lighting conditions.",CupraFormentor
"Unless you live in Germany,  the speed limit in Europe is 120km/h. 

So I guess you will be just fine.",CupraFormentor
"Bought it! 😎 Will get it in 2 weeks. That will be 2 very long weeks for sure!

Thnx for the replies.",CupraFormentor
100% normal,CupraFormentor
Direct-shift gearbox…? What was the question exactly?,CupraFormentor

This is the exact one I've put in both my formentor and 350z

Found it very easy to install and set up however I'm an electrical maintenance engineer so I have practical hands and knowledge in the area. I'm sure with plenty of reaserch an average Joe can self install.",CupraFormentor
"Also aircon, heated seats, climate control temps, defog/de-ice etc can be controlled by your voice assistant on the steering wheel when you ask it.

Much easier than using the infotainment.",CupraFormentor
Care to express your take on it? :),CupraFormentor
"There's an Italian guy who has uploaded the update. Obviously, you risk a soft brick. I took mine to the dealer.  You have to update a certain version before hitting 1940 update.  That's cured my issues",CupraFormentor
Did you check your front sensor for filth or damages? Its a big black square above the front bumper,CupraFormentor
"Honestly after waiting a year, it came on a bad weekend. Kids turns 7 tomorrow and tonight I've a busy night building toys and stuff. Rest of the weekend will be dominated by party stuff. 😂

I had a bit of a play in the parking lot at work. Had a demo with a Formentor for two weeks last year, so I remembered a few tricks.
I drive over 1200 miles a month for work, so I'll get to know this beauty soon enough.",CupraFormentor
Did you buy from Lister Cupra? I enquired there when wanting to purchase and they were rubbish.,CupraFormentor
I agree. For me the best (except the 310) is definitely the 190 4Drive. I wouldn’t buy an hybrid because it’s only front wheel drive and because it’s a small engine for a heavy car,CupraFormentor
You’re a star thank you,CupraFormentor
"It does indeed take a little over 3hrs to charge. I charge if I do a big shop, at home or at work. Never needed fast charging.",CupraFormentor
"Don't know for sure if you can program it, but you can use the app to preheat the car, or pre cool it.
But heating the car while not plugged will drain a lot of charge",CupraFormentor
Negligible if even noticeable,CupraFormentor
"I have the same issue, have contacted my dealership will update after they pick it up on a few days.",CupraFormentor
I hope everything will be alright with tour new Cupra,CupraFormentor
im running the 190hp v4drive version with 9.9L per 100k lol,CupraFormentor
"Not sure qhat you mean... If you connect a mobile phone to yoir formentor, it will be able to stream stuff. The sim in the car is only used for emergency services/upgrades as far as I know, and cannot be used to browse the web",CupraFormentor
"That happened to me, but thank God they told me that they just clear trash and update software of airbag sensor and all is good now",CupraFormentor
Yeah some weeks ago I was checking the configuration tool on their website and noticed it was gone. I think there's one or two motorisation options they've gotten rid of. Probably not enough people going for them between the 150 and 204/245 and 310 versions.,CupraFormentor
From November to April I use Michelin Aplin.,CupraFormentor

"Let them hate. You see it in every sub; jealousy brings the worst out in people who made the mistake of either buying the wrong one or not having the money to get a better one in the first place. 

Is the vz5 with the diagonal exhausts, in copper? I was fuming to find out that Europe gets a version we don’t but for no reason whatsoever lol. Not even like, leaving the EU or anything, just “because” 😂",CupraFormentor
"Hi :)

In contrast to KMS1785 and undefined310 I don't think that this is normal.  
It sounds like standing water which would have nothing to do with a bit of condensation because of ""temperature differences"".

My VZ does not sound like that.

Do you often drive short distances so that the exhaust system can't heat up properly so that the water accumulates over time? Or maybe you have a neighbour who does not like you very much?",CupraFormentor
I have it in my V2 with the reversing cam. Would assume it’s standard if you have the cam.,CupraFormentor
"Not sure if it works, only have these two which show it a bit, I can take some more if needed: https://postimg.cc/gallery/ZZ9xxYS

(Here in Austria we‘re quite restricted in modifying our cars, meaning we can‘t go past a certain point of the fenders with the wheel). 

Link to SCC: https://spurverbreiterung.de/en/spurverbreiterungssuche-nach-fahrzeugen/cupra-14577/formentor-km7-14578/

I think you could even fit 13-14mm in the front.",CupraFormentor
I also don’t understand those getting the 310/390 VZ ones… Each to their own I suppose,CupraFormentor
"The original rims are as good for winter as any other wheel. The width of the tires on the 18 inch is the same, so it won’t make a difference if you downsize to 18 for winter.

If you can change the wheels yourself and plan to keep the car for 4 years or more, I would buy some aftermarket wheels with winter tires (or find some used OEM wheels, but don’t pay full retail price as it’s not worth it).

If not, buy four winter tires and make your mechanic swap them two times a year, it will be cheaper in the long run than buying a second set of wheels.",CupraFormentor
I had the same issue on my Leon until updating the software to 1970 and it works most of the time now,CupraFormentor
"Yes, most of the time with 95 octane, E10. Simply because it’s my daily driver and fuel is expensive enough. :-(",CupraFormentor
Oh yeah indeed,CupraFormentor
I would go for the petrol just so I don't have to deal with AdBlue system,CupraFormentor
Just wish they had gone full tilt for the VZE. Making it as high performance as possible....,CupraFormentor
Also… is a golf r on (very small) stilts and “suv”?,CupraFormentor
Lol summer tyres in cold weather?! 😂,CupraFormentor
You really don't understand engine tuning do you? You really think the map in the cupra is the most efficient possible? Or even the best for power?,CupraFormentor
Would also like to know how to enable!,CupraFormentor
"The key to keeping this working long term, is to leave the selector in the adjustment position for that mirror.",CupraFormentor
"I’m trying to download the software update, but the planet icon is greyed out, so I assumed the car has no internet",CupraFormentor
"Ah thanks, sounds super hidden under lots of menus. Didn't know that was an option. I'll give it a go thanks.",CupraFormentor
"Will do, thanks so much for the comments, they were very useful and helpful. Keep up the good work! /s",CupraFormentor
Corrosion on the brakes are external influence not manufacturing defect. Lack of use makes this worse but as the discs are made from mild steel they start to corrode after just a few hours of being wet. You will find the inside of the disc is worse generally.,CupraFormentor
"**=** means it will keep the battery charge *around* that value, not exactly at that value. The span is about 10%. It will use some electricity when needed and then charge it back when possible.",CupraFormentor
"That's high praise for the VZ5 for sure, especially with its size being so much larger. Honestly if it wasn't for the seemingly endless list of complaints around electrical gremlins and other technical issues on this forum I would probably already have one in my garage. The VZ5 sure looks like the more exciting car but the M340i is really appealing with its seemingly quite bulletproof build quality and RWD-biased powertrain. 

Anyway, I think only the test-drives will decide what I ultimately go with. Both of these cars are almost certainly very competent driving vehicles, but whatever I buy needs to give me a genuine emotional connection like what I have now with my Focus ST. Far from the most impressive technical specs out there but it just puts a smile on my face whenever I get on it and has served me extremely well on everything from 1,000km long road-trips to laps on the Nordschleife.",CupraFormentor
What software version are you on?,CupraFormentor
"For starters, the formentor has less power, that was a deal breaker for me. There are several esthetic things that change (the rear bumper on the Leon has the real exhaust contrary to the formentor that has fake exhaust ""tips""), the Leon has better looking seats and finaly, the way each car handles on the road feels completely different. 

Take note that the differences in each model may vary for each country, here in Mexico we don't get many options. We have the Leon with 245hp and 300hp; Formentor 190hp and VZ 310hp. I bought the 245hp Leon",CupraFormentor
"I was at the dealership today and tried to order the new facelift Seat Leon, they told me the order program is blocked due to the new model being released in Fall
I would wait maybe to order in June or July even if you‘re not in a hurry. 

I‘m from Switzerland",CupraFormentor
Second that too,CupraFormentor
"For what’s it worth, a dude I know at a Cupra dealership where I bought mine told me that if I waited with my order there was a „risk” that the production schedule would shift into the facelift version and I’d wait much longer. This was in October last year and from what I remember the schedule cutoff was supposed to be around April or something like that. ",CupraFormentor
That's pretty much how it works,CupraFormentor
I have found this [review](https://techdriveplay.com/2024/03/07/2024-cupra-formentor-vze-phev-tdp-review/) on the 2024 VZe. Looks pretty good still tbh,CupraFormentor
"Are those the same construction years? Cause we got several Cupra, Audi A3 and two Skoda Octavia. All build 2021/22 and all of them got the problem. No problem with the Audi A6 same year, but that one got a totally different system. I also had no problems with my 2018 Seat Leon.",CupraFormentor
The dealer looked at the errors and there was nothing visible. I think they checked the updates too 🤷‍♂️ Last time they installed firmware 1940. How can I find out what firmware I have now? only through the dealer?,CupraFormentor
OTA updates doesn't require data plan.,CupraFormentor
Have you tried charging the battery using the engine ? Should give you some guidance if the battery is the problem or the rest of the system,CupraFormentor
Make it in right hand drive you cowards!,CupraFormentor
"Sounds like the usual problem with VAG cars… the perfect software.
Maybe there was a firmware update that made it not work… who knows.
Have you tried factory resetting the multimedia unit?
If that does not work: to the dealer, the car ist so new, that should be handled under warranty.

(I never tried using a thumb drive… but you have given me an idea 🤪)",CupraFormentor
Yeah I’m glad I went with the full 300hp (vz5 not available in UK). I don’t rev it on my drive but hearing the downshifts and pops when I drive is fun - it makes you feel like you’re connected to the car. I really don’t understand people who spent so much money on just a small engine with a sporty badge - they say you’re overcompensating but they’re the ones pretending.,CupraFormentor
"I have the 204hp version. I always charge it to 100%. In fact, during the week, I only use it in EV mode.

If I would charge only 85% of the battery,  I would get a very low range.

I also charge it every time I can. Unless I know it's going to be parked for a few days.",CupraFormentor
"Can't remember off the top of my head.
Think most levels are around 75% with subwoofer at max. I'll have a look next time I'm in the car.

I've got it on the immersive sound profile which sounds great having speakers behind you.

Like I say though, it probably depends on what you are used to.
I've come from a Seat Arona with a standard stereo system so the 9 speaker Beats Audio system in the Formentor blows it away.",CupraFormentor
"It's just a rendering from the car magazine, nothing official",CupraFormentor
"Havent heard of any differences between the models. I have the 2021 myself.

Its a strong car, the engine is good and reliable.",CupraFormentor
"I don’t see the price, what do they cost?

I got Aguri Prestige Black for 109€, they have 70kg capacity, but 130km/h max speed.",CupraFormentor
I found the same. Sport mode seems to get more than eco too. I’ve been told it’s that I need to drive differently too to make it work but I just drive how I always do.,CupraFormentor
"Not OTA, only if you update it manually. But officially no, and its secondhand",CupraFormentor
The low milage ones might be former lease vehicles,CupraFormentor
"I’ve not noticed the sub being that negative apart from the infotainment which is more of a VW problem and seems to have been sorted with the new update. 

Take that out and it’s lots of posts of beautiful Formentors 😍",CupraFormentor
What is the name of the last set of rims?,CupraFormentor
"It may not matter to you, but be mindful that if you get one that has a list price of over £40,000 your road tax will be £800 a year. For that reason I got the V2.",CupraFormentor
Just Look Out for a pram that you can fold Up a Bit. Got a cybex priam and its absolutely no problem,CupraFormentor
where did you order it from? do you have any link to share ? any image or video with the quality of it?,CupraFormentor
"But Mine is 190 hp, not a hybrid",CupraFormentor
"No, if you don’t rev it too high. It’s not the speed of wheels that matters, but the speed of the engine. The 1.4 TSI clocks about 2500rpm at highway speeds, which is absolutely in safe range for cold engine.

Do NOT rev the engine up to 4000rpm or higher when cold.

Btw, VW PHEVs run the oil pump even in electric mode, so the engine is started fully lubricated.",CupraFormentor
"I tested a VZ2 with the Beats system before I bought another VZ2; honestly, having compared the two, you won't really tell the difference.",CupraFormentor

"Yeap. All MQB evo VAG cars have it, and Formentor is not the cheapest",CupraFormentor
"They do avoid damage (to some extent).
If you interrupt the cleaning process too many times, there will be messages coming up reminding you to drive for at least 10 minutes.
If you ignore that, it will eventually go into service mode and force you into your workshop.",CupraFormentor
"That's strange, I'm pretty that if I switch the car off whilst on that screen, then when I start it up again it remains at the option it was previously ( which for me is ""this drive"")",CupraFormentor
I have the same dilemma...going to order a formentor 1.4 e-hybrid 204cv and I'm not sure between midnight black and magnetic grey. I would go with black if not that I really don't like those grey parts at the bottom which are actually very bad on the black imho. Question is...is there any option for having it in total black if keeping the 1.4 e-hybrid 204cc model?,CupraFormentor
"Nope, Germany 😅",CupraFormentor
"My VZ2 310 is our only car 🙂. It hates cold starts and short journeys, regularly getting sub 20mpg in those scenarios; longer cruising journeys of 10 or miles you can squeeze up to 35-40 out of it. B roads are hilariously good fun 👍",CupraFormentor
"Touch the brake pedal lightly when reversing. You can turn if off if it bothers, settings manoeuvre brake",CupraFormentor
"had the exact same problem a few weeks ago. I couldn\`t wait to go in 30 days to the dealer, so took my chances with the usb update. 

 Once it\`s in installation mode , so be quick in those 30 seconds, it does not restart or goes in black screen...Update went really smooth from there and no problems so far. 

That was in any case my experience.",CupraFormentor

"It is your choice to decide which one you like, although classically longer, lower cars will be considered better looking than higher, shorter ones.
I don’t see the appeal of crossover at all, there are no bonuses. Even if the Formentor is very good visually. But that is another topic and let’s end it there.",CupraFormentor
How much money did they save by not having this? Pennies probably. It's idiotic.,CupraFormentor
"Ok, it's likely that crash fix in 1969 may be for something different. MP3's from a usb-stick is probably not the most common use-case in 2024. I had a similar setup in my 2017 mazda but after the carplay upgrade i practically never used it :) Have you verified the file system integrity of that drive recently? Anycase, i primarily use spotify via carplay myself / stream stuff off the phone.  I've been running the 1969 for about a week now. Fingers crossed this is the most stable firmware yet.",CupraFormentor
Which engines have this cylinder deactivation mode?,CupraFormentor
"Best shortcut i know is using two fingers on the panel where you can adjust cold-warm and it instantly turns on the heat for the seats! 

Concerning power and traction, i can definitely say that i  felt the missing traction when i drove the vz 245 Leon versus my usual vz310 model with 4-wheel drive. The launch is completely different, but once you are up to speed they do pull nicely.",CupraFormentor

"It does fit me quite well, but I think I'd be a bit embarrassed wearing it 🤣 yeah my key cover doesn't fit properly either so I can't use it. I agree rubber boot mat would be a great addition or spare floor mats",CupraFormentor
"Yh to be honest it doesn't get cold enough in UK where I am to warrant having to change to winter/summer tyres... I've never had to with any of my previous cars, some which were much more powerful than my Cupra now.. It's mainly just rainy here haha...

I wonder if the tyres grip issue is due to them. Maybe being run flats? Any thoughts or experiences on this at all?",CupraFormentor
"Have a Leon ST VZ as a daily. Better choice than Formentor IMO, with bigger boot and (in my opinion of course, I just like station wagons) better looks along with slightly better price. So far around 15k km and the car is lovely, especially in winter and snow. The long-term fuel efficiency is 9.8l/100km, which is not bad considering it has 310hp and I often drive in city and start-stop is usually off.
Too bad there isn’t a Leon version of VZ5.",CupraFormentor

"There is a setting for ""smart heated seating"" buried somewhere deep in the Infotainment settings, which apparently tries to ""learn"" when you might want seat heating and enable it automatically. It will probably be inside the settings menu within the AC section.

"A little late reply but I had the same problem with my hybrid Cupra Leon. You need to turn on the option for the car to use the high voltage battery for climate control. That's why it gets hot when you're driving because the normal 12V battery gets recharged and turns the CC on. When stationary (especially when it's cold) it only heats for a couple minutes before the safety feature shuts the CC off to prevent the 12V from being drained too much.

The option to turn on heating from the battery is somewhere in your climate control menu and then a sub menu, if I recall correctly.

95 premium has more additives added.

"Agree with you u/IchBinDerKlaus , 3 - 4 weeks ago I didn't have this watery sound. The distance I drive daily is around 20km which takes me around 30-40minutes of drive (mainly city) and during this distance and time the car is already at its optimal temperature for all important car fluids, like engine oil, transmission oil and coolant. 

What you are saying is logical, if the car drives short distances and the car cannot get to its optimal fluid temperatures, it potentially could lead to such outcome.  
However, even if the car drives the short distances and don't reach its optimal fluid temperatures it still shouldn't sound that bad and more so on such small mileage.   
  
My previous car was Audi S5 where I drove daily only around 9km and not always cars fluid temperature got the ideal metric, but never had such issues.",CupraFormentor

"Like I said, minimal experince. I'm probably underestimating it by A LOT. The Leons are FWD only apart from the wagon, but let's be real only married men with children will get that one. My instructor always prefers me (and others) driving with nothing but ABS so we can get a feel for the car itself and not just rely on the safety systems. It's also a manual and I'm having quite a blast every time I have lessons. So by your opinion I'd say the 150 is probably my best choice, although I might get a 190 since the 2-3y old ones are dirt cheap.",CupraFormentor

I plan to drive my car in Eco for starters so I can get a feel for it. The only realistic use of Cupra for me woulf just be to mess around with friends on backroads because the car has a half-decent exhaust note. Nothing else than that really.,CupraFormentor
"I’ve halved the space with an organiser box for easy access to the 2 different charging cables and some accessories I need. The remaining room is more than enough for the weekly grocery. I take one bag to work daily what obviously fits easily. I do a yearly 2000km trip through Europe. For that the box comes out to have enough room and if I’m still in need there is the option to fold the rear seats or put a roofbox on.

To be honest I don’t see what would people need more room in a boot for unless they are in a trade that involves a lot of tools and raw materials.",CupraFormentor
They can under option 3. I’ve worked with cars for 11ish years and never known anyone be charged.,CupraFormentor
I keep off the paddles!  They are handy in snow though.  Once you’re used to automatic gearboxes you can really get them to shift faster than manual. It’s getting used to how they perform getting the right gears for corners etc. sport modes better there since it’s usually in a lower gear. Giving you the right entry speed for corners and more revs to play with existing them,CupraFormentor
"I have the vz2 hybrid and i was very anxious about the infotainment issues before getting my car. I tought i will absolutely hate the infotainment but even if 90% of users do hate the infotainment i had absolutely no restart and no issue with it even on the outdated versions of software. Also the steering wheel problem and head unit problem, none of them was present on my car and that made me very happy with my formentor.",CupraFormentor

"Hi,

Not sure where to find what you want yet, you should try some online VIN decoders first. (Free) 

The steering wheel button for the start engine and CUPRA mode are optional ( part of the supersport steering wheel ) 

To be fair, the 204 and 245 HP version got the same engines physically , but the 245HP got another controller version.",CupraFormentor
"Tbf that would wind me right up! I refused to get a vw golf R because of haptic buttons on the wheel. In my opinion the haptics are not used anyway because of the buttons on our wheel (although, i understand they did away with the cupra button on newer models?) but yeah, like when mercedes had the keyword “hey mercedes” and thought that was not going to backfire 😂",CupraFormentor
"It did for me, I only had the 1890 version for less than a month (couple restarts nothing major), then had them put in the 1940 along  the first oil change and it’s been smooth sailing for me since (about 10k km).
I believe there’s also another version already out there (not OTA yet) that makes it even more stable and quick.",CupraFormentor

"Hay, I have VZ 310hp version - i think the boot space is 450L. It is alright, but for longer trips you will struggle if you want to take your stroller with you. If we put our bigger stroller inside the boot its almost full. If you need some pictures, hit me up in DMs.",CupraFormentor
"I agree. I always had two set of wheels and swap them myself at home for the convenience. Even if it’s maybe a little more expensive, it’s worth it for me because I don’t have to book an appointment at my mechanics place.",CupraFormentor

You will have to replace 12V battery.  I had the same problem.,CupraFormentor
"My Formentor is one of the early versions and it doesn't have thisnfeatur,  so I can bet there never was",CupraFormentor
"Yes, it's true, it depends on the markets and in the market where Portugal operates, there is a diesel version. Thank you for the answer ;) not that I have a choice but to use the car even for short trips, in fact I believe that they (Cupra) will have prevented this type of situation with the same system that I complain about happening to avoid greater damage. My previous car was also a 2.0 diesel but from 2008, so it didn't have a particulate filter and didn't have this kind of hassle. Either way, thank you. compliments",CupraFormentor
"I will try, the downside of the camera is that I have to connect to its wifi and it constantly tries to switch back to CarPlay. And I as usually don’t have spare time to sit and reconnect",CupraFormentor
Update via USB stick,CupraFormentor
Off the line the start / stop can be like that on many cars. I switch it off if I want to get off the line properly. If you switch from a full EV car like a Tesla to the Cupra the EV linear power delivery makes you crawl off the line til you readjust.,CupraFormentor
"Yes I think copper exhaust trim should be an easy ""non-technical"" way to check. My 204 has the black exhaust trim, all 245s I've seen had the copper edges around the trim.",CupraFormentor
"This isn't really helpful, but I had a Ford Puma before a Formentor which and an B&O soundsystem. The Cupra has the stock soundsystem and the biggest difference I notice is the lack of a subwoofer. I'd recommend getting one with a sub for sure.",CupraFormentor
It's too cringe for my taste.,CupraFormentor
"Just try to charge your phone with it. 

Mine lasts a good 3-7 seconds before I get the error message and it stops. It’s probably the most useless part of the car!",CupraFormentor
How old is your car? Was it all still under warranty? I'm thinking about buying one but a bit worried after seeing comments like this,CupraFormentor
"As my experience, the new diesels are better for short trips than the old 1.9tdi. 
I would think things different:
Do you need or it helps to have the 4x4 traction? If you get snow on winter or make trips to mountains is good.
Do you drive on hightway? Also this matters as there is a significant consumption difference.
There will be a difference even for small trips and it will be big in numbers but in money spent it won't be.

I would chose the tsi from both of them and the reason is because is faster and safer (because it has haldex) but in certain circumstances the diesel would be better. Take it from a diesel driver perspective.",CupraFormentor
Any suggestions on a better tyre in that case which may be better re grip?,CupraFormentor
Fish Eye mode is great! There should be a button at the bottom when the reversing camera is activated!,CupraFormentor

He’s driving on summer tyres in January. Changing tyres will do wonders there.,CupraFormentor
"Yes, all from MY2022 to 2024. Some have problems but the Cupra is by far the worst.

"- comical voice activation (my wife’s tone of voice sets it off every 30 seconds so it’s turned off) 
- driver assist and cruise control sensors that don’t work when the air is cold and damp
- rear AC controls that don’t work (since the last infotainment update)
- haptic controls I can’t see in the dark or control by touch without looking at them (requiring the interior lights when it is dark… which currrently have broken touch controls)
- seat leather that has creased and worn after 4000 miles because I am applying undue pressure on it (according to Cupra customer support)

To be fair, most issues I have are around or due to faults with the touch sensitive UI for everything, which is not unique to the Formentor.

I am hoping to get the rear AC controls (and non working interior light controls) back when the dealership look at it in a few weeks, so to be fair they are just faults.",CupraFormentor
With 450L - no problems whatsoever. I don’t think those 30L matter that much.,CupraFormentor
"and what color for the copper parts, for example rims? Is it L27A?",CupraFormentor
"When setting your cruise control, the plus and minus buttons will move in multiples of 10 but the SET and RES buttons will move in single units for you.

Driver assist keeps you central to the lane you are travelling in, it gives you prompts every little while to have input on the steering wheel so it is not fully autonomous and if you don't it will apply the brakes to remind you and if you still don't put in a wheel input it will stop the car. I use it when making long journeys (6 hours or so) to lessen the amount of steering having to do and I've found when I arrive in my Forementor I've been a lot fresher than I have in other vehicles I've done the journeys in.",CupraFormentor

"I take mine to a local Skoda dealer that also does Seat servicing. As long a dealer caters for Seats, they can service Cupras too.
Was one of my concerns too, before I got mine.",CupraFormentor

It's not great for the front tyres though, going full lock while stationary.",CupraFormentor
"I got updates every couple weeks to a month so the software should about be the newest version. If it's just my car, don't know. There are not a lot of formentors in the area. 

In the end personal for me, the looks are great, the car is rubbish.",CupraFormentor
"My best guess would be „have you tried turning it off and back on again“? Meaning cutting power entirely for a few minutes. But afaik that’s not a good idea on modern cars since all the sensors and gimmicks run crazy afterwards.

So > off to the dealer. :-(",CupraFormentor
"Definetly the Magnetic gray. I think that is the best color for the formentor, if you don’t want to go for the matt colours. It is really magnetic adapting the tone quite a bit depending on the surroundings. Also really enhances the shape way more then the black or white colours.",CupraFormentor
"The problem is, the new one doesn't look as good.",CupraFormentor
"Mine is great in sports mode, and still fun the drive, but just because I know it can be quicker in Cupra I want to try what I can to make it work haha

"Without talking to a specialist/ cupra technician it would be hard to tell. However if the car drives fine and no warning lights then I'd assume its normal. I've had mine since June last year and it's done it the whole time.

"I also have the V2 manual but no heated steering wheel, it wasn't an option at all. Mine is a 2023 model so I think they've dropped that feature unfortunately, I had it in my last car and now winter is kicking in, I do miss it.

Tyre wise, I was really unlucky and picked up a bolt in the tyre driving it home from the dealer and had to pay £170 for a replacement Michelin. Budget tyres I've found for £70 fitted so it's not bad, the premium tyres are definitely *premium* prices though. 

I also don't like the Michelin's it came with, the asymmetric 5s, not very grippy in wet/icy conditions and it's not like the 1.5 has too much power to put down. 

The seats though *chefs kiss*, absolutely magnificent.

I too bought on the 0% finance deal, mine is over 3 years and cupra were offering a service plan for £99 if bought on 0% when I did it a few months ago so look into that if you haven't already, it's a no brainer. I personally think theyve readjusted prices more accurately after the insanity of the last few years (my last car was in positive equity 3 months after buying it new in 2020, ended up with £6.5k to put down on the Formentor and it was only a Skoda Octavia!) and settled it all down now so I'm not expecting much equity at the end of my 3 years but who knows",CupraFormentor

"I’m absolutely happy with mine. I commute 10 miles each way to workplace on a town street/motorway(15/85%). The car just does it all in electric mode if I don’t run its preheat option for way too long before setting off. I suppose it would also depend on the weather but here(Yorkshire) it doesn’t get so cold.

I’m glad I took alloy wheel cover with it. Road conditions here and these softish alloys are not the greatest fit. These alloys are fragile compared to what I was used to(Vauxhall Astra, Toyota Yaris). 

This is my first phev. I found the cable situation annoying. Standing in the rain rolling a slightly muddy cable up has its challenges. It’s nice to have a glove for that. In return I didn’t have to go to the petrol station to get everything smell petrol. I would actually prefer the petrol station issue slightly over the cable issue. Just to be clear neither is a game changer.",CupraFormentor

I’ve recently bought my formentor v2. The infotainment runs the version A896. CarPlay is playing up on it only when I’d like to swap from my partners phone to the other while both are connected. Other than that we didn’t have any problems with any part of the car.,CupraFormentor

"To try and answer some of your questions:

I have an auto and I have a steering wheel heater. 

I wouldn’t bother with a pan roof but I am very pale and very blonde and hate being too hot. I have previously had a car with a sunroof and it was stifling. It’s totally personal preference. 

Tyres are about £190 if you go for an equivalent, valve and balance. I drove over a vape just over a year ago and it slashed the tyre, the puncture kit just spilled over the drive. Had to replace a tyre but struggled to find an exact match so I have a Jaguar one, but unless you’re looking you can’t tell - tho I can! 

0% PCP is fine but check the deposit. Some are asking for 20-30% for 0% PCP contracts. You might prefer to pay a smaller deposit and take a small interest. 

PCP is designed for smaller deposits and smaller payments. If you’re not sure what PCP is fully, I’d have a research into it. I was 3.9% with £1500 FDA. I’d rather pay a little bit of interest than part with all my savings. Equity is built into PCP finance contracts based on the current and projected used car market, using factors like your contract mileage, spec of your car, your planned length of contract. There’s no guarantee you’ll come into positive equity at the end, but same goes with negative equity or parity. The longer the contract, the smaller your monthly payments. I’d honestly speak to your dealer to find the right type of contract for you.",CupraFormentor

"Far from it 1940 made things far worse!  There’s so many ‘new’ glitches now it’s unbelievable. The satnav goes green screen more often, the rear parking sensor screen often won’t switch when you put it in gear leaving no visible’dashboard. Similarly the door open window shows even though all doors are locked…also leaving no ‘dash’. Hard restarts do nothing, only switching off and leaving it a while works. Screen often just goes black along with the dashboard. Some days it can take two to three minutes to actually come on others it’s instant. Satnav does what it likes often just rotating direction of travel and sending you the wrong way to where you want to go.  That’s just the tip of the iceberg…cruise control reversed speed control buttons, cutting out when turning CC off, fun at 70+mph! Wipers operating when you turn the wheel and not going off etc etc.  Doors that either won’t lock at all (very common) or won’t open!  The whole things a nightmare.",CupraFormentor

I however don’t see why it would charge the battery from the petrol engine while maintaining a steady speed with the electric engine. While I say this Nissan decided to put a petrol generator in their car that doesn’t move their car but charges a battery that fuels an electric motor that moves the car at any given time.

"Yeah if I could afford a proper M3, there would be no contest.


Not sure I would call the Formentor a full SUV though, I've seen a VZ5 in a parking garage and it was barely taller than a hatchback. It's really one of the main selling points for me, I think the design is really sleek which sets it apart from the other sporty SUV/CUVs.",CupraFormentor

Internet fora by nature attract whiners … No high tech car is perfect and shares some frustrations with VAG siblings particularly software quirks. I had one frustrating problem with an OTA upgrade gone wrong which left me with infotainment screen flashing like a Christmas tree and unable to access anything therein not even climate control or reverse camera. Managed to take it in to dealer who resolved it in 4 hours. Otherwise drives and looks like a dream,CupraFormentor

1969 firmware should fix that crashing issue AFAIK (i recall the service desk guy mentioning that when i got my firmware updated last week).  Did your situation improve? I also noticed that things were a LOT more stable by doing a factory reset and configuring from scratch when going from 1898 to 1940.,CupraFormentor

"Hey u/thudufushi, 

1. By default, you have the same seats as in VZ, but you can pay extra to get those bucket seats.  
2. Yes, you can put 95 petrol, but it's not recommended by the manufacturer, the engine is manufacturer in consideration that owner will fill it with 98 octane petrol. *(The engine is from the Audi RS3)*   
3. Yes, you can wash it at pressure washer, nothing won't happen to it. It's safe.   


**Things to consider:**   
1. The dust on matte paint holds on a bit stronger and more visible. Which means that you will have to visit pressure washer more often that with regular paints.   
  
2. Matte color is a bit more delicate in terms of scratches, they are more visible and it's easier to scratch it even with the objects you didn't think could scratch it.",CupraFormentor

"Even if you don't have access to a charger at home, you do want to be making sure you charge it semi-regularly. It's a PHEV or ""Plug-in"" Hybrid, not a self-charging hybrid. The car is designed to be plugged in and topped-up and while you can drive around with a low battery for a while, it is not designed to be *continuously* driven with an empty HV battery.

When you get the warning ""HV Battery Empty - Charge Now"", the car is warning you that you've been running with a flat battery for too long and you now need to plug it in soon, so the car can re-condition the battery.

Some hybrid vehicles use the main electric motor as the combustion engine's starter motor instead of a conventional starter motor powered by most cars' low-voltage battery. I'm not sure if this is the case for the Cupra, but if you've been carrying the HV battery around as a paperweight for too long, your car possibly no longer has enough power in the HV system to actually start the combustion engine - hence your Dashboard is now lit up like a Christmas Tree, including the ""Starter system"" fault.

Get yourself an extension lead, use the 3-pin charger and see if that gets the car going again. Otherwise you're probably going to need to call out recovery, which is going to cost you a fair bit more.",CupraFormentor

The infotainment has bugged out about 4-5 times in the 10 months I’ve had it, but most of those were at the start. We now run the updates frequently and haven’t seen issues since.

You can set a battery reserve in hybrid mode.

There is even a loophole to get a previous insurer to pay the TP if by some miracle the existing wriggle out of it. And further still, the Motor Insurance Bureau has (some) funding to pay a TP if all of this fails, followed by small claims courts as the end of this path.

When you try to engage via the app, it gives you a warning if it's not plugged in - press continue and the heating still kicks in immediately.

This is definitely an error, unless extremely low temperatures can interfere? I haven't tried the function below -10°C",CupraFormentor

">What can happen is your insurer can choose not pay your damages if you were deemed at fault, but again this won’t be affected by an undeclared mod. 

Out of all the excuses insurers make up to avoid paying, you can't imagine that an undeclared mod that changes engine performance will not make them jump on this? 

I'd say it depends on the circumstances, but that shit will void your registration and gets your car towed to impound + a heavy fine and might even get your license suspended where I'm from.",CupraFormentor

"Nothing's wrong, it just fits my budget and it seems like a lot of car for the price.

Insurance would cost me about 200-250€ since I'm gonna be SF 0 (highest insurance group in Germany).
You have a point with the power and acceleration, but I'm not exactly the type of person to drive fast, I like to stay within my limits unless the road conditions are absolutely ideal and I can without a doubt go faster. I'd probably drive this car in Eco 90% of the time because like you said, first car.

The way that I'm looking at it though, 99% I will get the de-tuned 190hp version which is a way more realistic number for me. Insurance is also a few bits cheaper, about 80€ or so cheaper than the 300.",CupraFormentor
That's a recall update,CupraFormentor
"I had my Subaru chipped about six months after getting it what a difference. I also changed the air filter for a more free flowing one. The difference was well worth it better performance and fuel economy. I found in general use the car performed better, pickup was cleaner and basically it was similar characteristics but with more oomph. Fuel economy was much superior probably due to not been chocked by emission controls.

Regarding hassles for services etc? None about five minutes max to unplug and change filter. A drive round and it reset. Service done I just put stuff back in simple as that, I even did it in the garage car park. Just make sure that the company has a good name / reputation",CupraFormentor

"My VZ has the 19"" rims both on summer and winter tires (summer are copper colored, winter are silver colored), they work great. But obviously there are more opportunities to scratch your rims when you drive through narrow, plowed icey roads so having more rubber horizontally is useful. The OG 19"" rims are pretty expensive so it's not the most cost effective option. You can probably find a more affordable but good looking second set from a 3rd party. A tire set for the 19"" rims isn't cheap either, so if you are looking at bang for buck, you may also be better off with a smaller set of rims.",CupraFormentor

"The European version arrived in 2017, which we now know as DQ381 (0GC). The most significant difference between the two versions is that the DQ380 is only available for front-wheel drive cars, while the DQ381 is available for both front-wheel drive (DQ381-7A) and all-wheel drive (DQ381-7F) models. Since 2017, the DQ381 has been mainly used in VAG models which are built on the MQB platform and use the well-known 2.0 liter TSI block.

I read something about this a few days ago. In Germany you should be able to order it in week 22. and there will be a point of time where they stop produce the old one and even if u ordered the old one it can happen that you will receive a facelift when the delivery date is past the facelift start.,CupraFormentor

The Leon is basically a VW Golf and therefore way louder and less comfortable than a Passat.

"It does sound pretty good 👍; though I am not going to comment on whether or not having the Formentor in a hybrid is a good or a bad thing (full disclosure I have a VZ2 310). However, us 2.0 turbo petrol owners need to remember that brands have an average emissions requirement to meet, so the hybrids are a necessary part of the Formentor line; not to mention the fact that from 0-20 or so having the electric motor makes the car feel quicker than it is 🙂.",CupraFormentor

My previous Leon on DSG had same issue though.",CupraFormentor
Hmm sounds interesting. Do you have a source for that?,CupraFormentor
"Thank you so much for taking the time to reply. I too am pale and blonde and hate hot weather, so maybe it isn't a good idea for me to get the sunroof then either. 

I'll probably get the spare wheel then (it's only a space saver), it's £160 but it will be worth it if something like that happens to me. There's tons of vapes laying around nowadays. Regarding the PCP, I was going to put down a bigger deposit to bring the monthly payments down. It will be my current car that will provide the deposit so it won't really be any loss. I don't really like paying for things monthly but in this case, if I want something nice, it has to be done, but a lower monthly payment would interfere with my life less. The difference in balloon payment is only £1000 (£18,000 for two years, £17,000 for 3) so I was thinking I'd be better off going for two years as the value of the car will be more after two years than three (when the price kind of bottoms out). To be honest I don't trust the dealer to advise on something like this.",CupraFormentor
"Yes.
Driving hybrid cars requires a bit of thinking ahead to avoid excessive wear on the combustion engine.

Or at least do it like Goblas and accelerate only very moderate and avoid high RPMs until at least 60°C oil temperature.",CupraFormentor
"I don't know of any major difference between 21 and 23.. Maybe the matrix lights.

Not for me. Main problems are the shade gets stuck a lot and the stupid touch buttons only work 10% of the time. Entire panel replaced recently as it was defective - new one works half the time so I guess that's an improvement!?,CupraFormentor
Get your dealer to update to 1940 or 1969. Solves most if not all stability issues,CupraFormentor

"Just to be clear, you can't do the first part with OBD11. Only the dealer can do it, as it requires special software. Only after FL is activated, you can do the wireless part. Good luck!",CupraFormentor
"Yeah, I wouldn't mess around with this error. If you can get your hands on an OBD reader or diagnostic tool, try and grab the error code from the system.

Otherwise, get to the workshop and get them to take a look at it. The brakes are part of the safety equipment and not something to leave to chance.",CupraFormentor
"Ask the dealer where you bought it, if they can either name you the part number or if they can source it for you. If they have a repair shop, they are definitely going to be able to order parts.",CupraFormentor
 I'm also looking for one. The cup holders are useless in my opinion,CupraFormentor
"Yeah, can confirm. To get good traction you will have to get good tyres.",CupraFormentor
"Yes but those were souped up versions of the seat they were replacing. You can’t go back and simply say a low number wasn’t good - original ferrari’s had low bhp compared to these cars, but they were still super cars. 

To your point though; Cupra are no longer a performance brand. They’re a Luxe brand now - their lower end cars are better than VW’s offering and eating Audi’s base by doing so, which does beg the question as to the point of having two brands under that umbrella at the same consumer base. 

Nonetheless, you don’t have to like it, but some of us got the proper Cupra variants, and we don’t really see the point in the lower Bupra spec models - see previous paragraph. 

I wouldn’t buy a BMW with a “1” anywhere in it’s name, because its not a proper bmw. Same for a Mercedes, if it has a “1”, it’s the baby / poverty spec variant.",CupraFormentor
"If you put the wing mirror dial in the left position, and put it into reverse, the left wing mirror will dip so you can see the curb.

It's total shit. The subwoofer is the worst part. 0 difference.",CupraFormentor

"Idk, but from my experience the difference between the normal and the Bose system isn't noticeable. I've recently tested both.

What was noticeable however was the missing subwoofer in the trunk which I don't have because I have the plugin hybrid which has a massive battery in the trunk instead of a spare tire (the subwoofer is in the spare tire).",CupraFormentor

"My commute to work is very short at only two miles each way so I expected the range to be reduced because I'm mainly doing short trips from a cold start in cold conditions at the moment (UK).

If I drive full EV I reckon I can get three days of my commute with a couple of slightly longer evening trips getting the kids to various places in hybrid mode included so it's not a big problem.

I just wanted to make sure there wasn't a potential problem with the battery or there was a setting that I wasn't aware of and I was only charging up to 80/90% capacity for instance.

"Hi there.

It's normal, no need to visit your workshop.The moment the front facing camera (top of the windshield) or the radar eye (beneath your license plate) is even slightly impaired (foggy, dusty, wet etc.), it will throw this message.

* Sometimes when i move the automatic gear from P to D, the break is still stuck. So i have to shift back and fourth until it works
* Roof touchpanel for light and sunroof got completely dead, so i had to go replace it by warranty
* The touch sensor to lock and unlock the car from the door handle is sensitive. Doesnt always respond.
* The engine cover..... Since i bought the car, i never had an engine cover. It looks so ugly when you open the hood and looks unsafe to me. Covers are there for a reason

You don’t necessarily have to have high rpm on the motorway either. Even though it uses the combustion engine it seem to accelerate using the electric motor mostly unless you push it.

"Hi, I have a V2 Manual. It has the heated seats and steering wheel (anything more than 1 on the setting gets HOT haha). I didn’t go for the sunroof though.

I’ll have had mine 3 years in the summer, my post history will tell you I’ve had loads of problems in the past with the GPS getting lost and other software issues along with some really poor support from Cupra customer services/VW Finance. But since the last major software update (version 1940) I had done in August it’s been good as gold.

Mechanically I’ve had absolutely no issues with the car. Haven’t had to replace brakes yet but due punctures and wear I’m on my 3rd set of front tyres and 2nd set of rears. Cost me £675 last summer for a full set of Pirelli tyres with fitting.

When I say ""overheating"", I mean if you're trying to pull too much of a load through a plug or circuit that isn't suitable for it. E.g if the wires in your house melt or catch fire.

The AC system has is pretty stupid and slow.",CupraFormentor
"I had the experience that it will use more battery in eco mode (to save gas) and will charge it in Sport/Cupra Mode (to always have peak performance). So try changing the driving mode. Maybe that helps. But in general I had the same problem with maintaining the battery level. 

On the subject recuperation/regeneration: Automatic means that it adjusts it depending on traffic, slope, signs and battery level. For example you go 50, recuperation is just on a mild level as you are going the speed limit. then there is a 30 zone ahead, it will automatically switch re-gen to high until you slow down to 30 and then turn it of again. Works with ACC and traffic stops/red lights the same. When battery is full then there is almost no automatic re-gen breaking, only if you use the pedal. And on mountains, going up re-gen is of, going down re-gen is on maximum.",CupraFormentor

Whats the average fuel consumption on a hybrid?,CupraFormentor
"Yes, the software is constantly having updates to cure various issues. It seems to be every day we update at least one car for the issues. I've never had to check via 5F screen as we use the ODIS laptop",CupraFormentor

"Well, one can't really decide whether they can afford something without running the numbers. It is great that OP researches this and all the answers can aid someone else in the future. Can't see anything wrong with that aspect. 

No one here bought the Formentor vz5 because the lambo consumption was out of their budget. You can probably expect someone that buys a lambo or similar to not ask these questions, but vz5 is no supercar after all. You can get it for 50K euro new with most bells and whistles.",CupraFormentor
"I forgot to add, the Cupra is the first car I’ve owned since high school that burns oil. 

It’s 2024 and I’ve got a brand new car that needs top ups between oil changes 😂",CupraFormentor

Have you checked if there's a software update via dealer for the 5F control unit?,CupraFormentor
It is the design now. Made the shortcut buttons a pain in the arse to use 😂,CupraFormentor
"I've just topped mine up a couple weeks back. Mine has about 9000km on it and is about 8 months old. It is normal to consume a bit of oil until the first service.

With that said, open the hood and there should be a sticker somewhere usually near the front to tell you the oil spec. For me it was VW508/509.

I then rang the dealerships near me and asked their parts desk if they had my oil spec in stock and topped it up myself. A protip, Seat, VW, Cupra and I believe all the VW family carry the same oil spec at their parts desk. 

If you're getting the warning light on the dash I would urge you to make topping up the oil a priority. Too little oil will damage the engine.

Also when you do top it up, do it slowly, add a small bit at the time, let it sit for a few seconds and then keep checking the level on the dipstick. Too much oil can also damage the engine. It's detailed in the manual if you haven't done it before.

If you're not up to it yourself someone from the dealership might do it for you, it's a simple job and it should only take a minute or so to do.",CupraFormentor
Yeah i would imagine that would be really nice to have the extra hps and eletric aswell. Just didnt really fancy going hybrid tbh and the cars gets a lot heavier which is unfortunate. Dont good tyres fix the traction issue? I would imagine if you put conitinental sportcontact 7s on there you would have plenty or traction,CupraFormentor
"Is that total 50 mpg? Because that is my point, the hybrid system tanks when it’s out, and you’re running on a 1.4L 150 hp engine with a minor boost to initial acceleration (which honestly I doubt, probably more placebo than actually happening as batteries at zero tend to do nothing).",CupraFormentor
True,CupraFormentor
Most recalls aren't urgent and carried out next time the dealer sees the car. If it's urgent they will contact you.,CupraFormentor
"I test drove the hybrid and was dissapointed. Having a battery deplete when you want it in sport mode and floor it just takes the fun out of it, you’re then left with a 1.4 litre 150hp carrying around extra dead weight of the battery",CupraFormentor

"My mom is the one who pitched me the idea of getting a newer car for about 30k€, I would've been fine with a 30yo Golf had she not offered to buy me a car. As for the costs, she will most likely cover leasing and the rest for the first year or two until I'm financially stable enough to do it myself. 

After some thorough thinking I'm 99% sure I will either get a 4x4 TDI Formentor with 150hp or a VZ1 Leon with 190hp as they are the best choices price and reliability-wise. I've found out from another person that 1.5s use a dry clutch system which tends to fail and cost a pretty penny to repair, so I will stick with wet clutch DSGs.",CupraFormentor
"There used to be. It winds me up so much that this feature was removed for some reason. Now you’re just guessing, and you always find out at the worst time.",CupraFormentor
"Hey OP I’ve just bought a second hand Formentor recently too and had exactly the same issue. Let me shed some light on the problem. 

- The ‘knocking’ noise is actually the SOS module crackling through the center channel speaker. 
- If you haven’t already, you’ll likely receive an SOS warning light come up on the dash at some point 
- This is a known VW group ‘scandal’ for cars built around 19/20-23 years (Google and you’ll find articles on faulty SOS modules. 
- Dealers will claim there is a dealer only software update that will fix this (I am waiting for mine to go into the shop so will keep you updated if that’s true or not.. I doubt it)

A known workaround for now is to either:
- put it in maximum privacy mode
- turn off the SOS assist function every time you get in the car (pain in the butt). 

I hope that helps and would love to know how you get on with this fault and resolution. I will do the same. 

Bloody love the car though!!",CupraFormentor
"Not personally, 99 all the way like you say, but I can see why you might run 95 if you are doing long distance driving",CupraFormentor
"Used it to show people, it’s ok? But honestly I just prefer to park by myself. I have used it for a parallel park in a tiny market town, it did a good job but it was so slow about it I looked like I was about 80 years old and slowly pulling off a perfect park 😂",CupraFormentor
Same problem. Happened after 1 month.. has now been 4. They pulled the roof down and repacked it. Fixed... until I went diagonally over a speed hump.. very slowly. Must have shifted the packing... heading back in. Add in the door grab handle rattles... it's a very noisy drive.,CupraFormentor

"Oh, that is good to know. Did not know that. So updating from the USB is out of the picture. If I won't get any update this week I will def. go to the service. Someone mentioned that he pays the 50$ fee for the SIM Pack in the cupra app. Would you say that could help?",CupraFormentor
"You have to buy a code from your local dealer and the dealer can activate it.

The part number you need is 5F0054830E. Cost depends on your country, I've seen from EUR 180 to 350. Plus labor.

You can also ask your dealer to activate wireless Android Auto / Apple CarPlay. They may refuse or pretend they can't. Then you have to buy OBD11 or another similar device and do it yourself. Total cost about 100 euro.",CupraFormentor

"VW can’t do Software, never rely on this stuff.

I found front assist to be an absolute waste of space. It occasionally notices things screeches turns the dash red but absolutely no braking whatsoever even on ACC. Compared to Subarus eyesight Al the ‘safety’ electronics are primitive.

Switching users…mine does that on every start up….it has since I bought it. You should be able to do it as soon as it switches on - switching back is normal starting routine for me.

"I have a VZE Leon, which is basically the same powertrain. If you know you are going to need some power in the near future put the car into hybrid some time before (at least 5 minutes) so the engine can go through its warm-up phase (you can tell it's in that phase by the crossed out ""E"" symbol on the left side of the drive screen.) During that phase the car only uses its combustion engine, so if you drive it hard during it will create excessive wear and tear. Once it's past that phase the e-motor will assist you getting up to speed to a motorway, so unless you go hard, the combined power should be plenty. 

In any case, avoid driving the car hard until you've reached at least 60°C, preferably actually 80°C for stuff like launch control and so on. 

 I would also suggest using the left screen widget to monitor your temperatures, like mentioned previously.",CupraFormentor

"Hey guys,

Just came back from the dealer, the service man listened to the sound and he said the same thing as in comment by the u/IchBinDerKlaus if you drive short distances and car doesn't get to the operating temperatures then yes, this could lead to condensation building up a lot, but like I said in my post, I drive daily around 40-50km where I have both highway and city.

So, the dealer took of the tailpipe, and they thought that there will be a water buildup, but nothing. Maybe some small drips.  
They didn't find any issues, so it looks like this could be normal? Which is still strange, as I don't find it to be normal for any car to make this sound out from exhaust system.

Anyway, if you have similar issue and you stumbled upon this post. Don't worry, it looks like Cupra, has this watery sounding ""feature"" with their exhaust system.",CupraFormentor

To be honest this is how it works in the whole VAG group for the last 20 years or so. It was not developed for this car specifically.,CupraFormentor
"Hey. Fellow VZx Melbourian here. I find it is high at first but moderates - I think cold engine + stop starts mean it isn’t very efficient. Even though I never get to a point of engine turning off at lights (battery never seems to be charged enough), it does moderate on longer trips, so anything over 10 mins it should start to get down to 10-12l/100km. I struggle to go below 11 or so to be honest - only when I am cruising at 80-100kph so I start to see 8L/100Km. 
Basically, it isn’t that efficient and certainly not at short bursts. I think the computer might overstate the high usage at first when cold, but I still am only getting 450-470Km from a tank. 9000km on the clock now.",CupraFormentor

By the looks of the two cars' specs on paper they don't seem to be all that far off from each other so I was surprised by how much people seem to favor the M340. 

The touchscreen in the Cupra is admittedly not ideal, but most of the time I have a passenger with me anyway so it wouldn't be a deal-breaker. Just curious but why do you say the BMW's gearbox is better? As far as I was aware, they run an 8-speed slushbox which is tuned very well but I would have thought the DSG still gives a more immersive experience with more analog-feeling shifts.",CupraFormentor
"It's just a massive PITA to get them swapped and balanced at the end of the season when it's busy anyway at the tire shops. A regular swap around here is  \~25-30€, a full rim swap and balancing costs more. You can probably get a nice 3rd party rim set for a price that pretty quickly pays itself if you continuously pay for a full tire service, besides the 19"" tires are pretty pricey on their own. In finland retailers may scoff at your car if you don't have 2 full sets of tires and rims on it if you plan to swap your car :)",CupraFormentor

I daily drive the vz2, its fine. My commute is 1hr with traffic or 27 minutes without. Mpg on average day is about 30, but on cold days 26-28. 

And, you get to go around all the muppets doing 40 in a 60 because, the thing is a monster. I think Matt from Carwow nailed it, there’s no way its only 310, 4.1s to 60 in the wet is absurd.",CupraFormentor
I will have the dealer check this module and updates for it.,CupraFormentor
"first question, go for 190HP TSI, no doubt.

Second question, I don't know",CupraFormentor
"Seems like a good price, in the description it says it has the matrix light but on picture it doesnt look like it. The only thing I could say is to check if it has the latest infotainment update 1940 but for rest would say do a test drive",CupraFormentor
"Go to dealer and tell them to update your software to 1940 or above. I have 1969, 0 issues since then.",CupraFormentor
"I'll buy one from Germany used with around max 30k km at about 40-45k €, also I found a few new for under 50k €",CupraFormentor
It’s been that way since I had the big update to 19whatever it is. Everything is tiny now.,CupraFormentor
"I've had mine 3 weeks, and have suffered the exact same issue. When you have the SOS error, note the light on the roof panel where the SOS button is, it should be green, it won't be!

You'll probably experience all of the following at some point in the near future.....

1 - ""loading settings"" and a spinning wheel going on FOR AAAAGES, sometimes your whole journey and you won't be able to listen to the radio, or use anything via the infotainment system

2 - if you've set yourself up as the primary user of the car, it will kick you off and go back to Guest mode every few days, so you'll lose all your radio settings etc

3 - The crack/pop noise.....several times a journey, EVERY journey!

4 - The app, useless, can't communicate with car, will report your windows are open, or the boot, or the car's unlocked but it's not!

5 - remote locking via the app. Doesn't work unless you go to main dealer to verify you own the car!

6 - Cupra Connect app integrating with your power suppliers app to provide smart charging on cheap tariffs - doesn't work and your car won't be charged in the morning - because the infotainment system randomly resets overnight, therefore also your primary user settings and security settings for remote access to the cars settings resets, along with access to location sharing, and the power supplier app can't tell your car is in your drive!

7 - the infotainment system will randomly reboot while you're driving!

8 - shall I go on, because there's more! 🤪

Anyway, I've been told by my nearest Cupra dealer it's because my software needs an update to version 1940.

I'm booked in later this month! They told me my car had several missed recalls, including the software update, luckily it's still in warranty period! Fingers crossed!",CupraFormentor
It’s 420 liters on my vz 310hp with spare wheel,CupraFormentor
Yeah they are unfortunately. Don’t know why the put this basic ones 🥹,CupraFormentor
Would it be a good idea to update to 1896 by the usb port? Or can this contain serious issues?,CupraFormentor
Consider that if you buy a hybrid the battery will drain faster because of the AC if you have a black car,CupraFormentor
"I bought mine july 1st last year…price I’ve been offered is £11000 less than I paid, that’s with 3000 miles. Servicing I got a two year service pack in on the price",CupraFormentor
"Fuel consumption driving carefully is around 10-11 liters/100. In the city it’s at least 15.

Remember you need 98 octane fuel at all times…",CupraFormentor
"Have you connected your car to you home WiFi? There's several updates you need to perform. Else, book it in with the service centre. Takes several hours to complete",CupraFormentor
"I set my temp, place it onto auto and untick the a/c button to save  fuel. 
Basically, it just uses the blowers automatically  for hot, and  the outside air for cooling... climate control but without engaging the aircon. 
In summer I turn the A/c button on if required.


Usually auto and one pip, as the blowers stay quiet",CupraFormentor
"The stock tyres are decent it's just a lot of torque and it tends to make it torque steer like a bitch, it really needs awd or rwd",CupraFormentor
"I have the same car.

Love it, power isn't an issue but traction is, it torque steers like a bitch and really struggles to get the power down.

The puddle lights make me smile every time I see them.",CupraFormentor
Bought mine new fairly recently and came with 1940 software already installed. I've had zero issues so far. The infotainment can be a little frustrating in places but every car has its own quirks?!,CupraFormentor
"The difference in power would be noticeable only at higher speeds. The torque is the same between the two engines, so at low speeds it would be pretty close feeling (even though the acceleration times would still be quite a lot faster with the petrol).

What would be more noticeable is the 2WD vs 4WD if you drive on snow or mud/gravel. I’d buy the 190 only because of that, but I live in a country with snow and ice in winter.

If you do a lot of small trips, I would definitely get the petrol. The fuel economy of the diesel on small trips would not be great and it’s bad for the engine not to heat up properly. The 190 4Drive gets you 7 to 7.5l/100 on longer trips, while still being decent on shorter trips.

Buy the rear view camera, it would be a PITA if not impossible at all to add it later, especially with the new infotainment systems those cars have…",CupraFormentor
The USB ports in the central console,CupraFormentor
I think they can not compare with each other . bmw is not suv and rear wheel drive .  Also it is M with 480 hp and 550 nm.,CupraFormentor
How to check??,CupraFormentor
"Oh yes, I forgot about that, I got that too. That's a nice touch",CupraFormentor
I first connect the cable then start the app..,CupraFormentor
Is that permanent or does it reset?,CupraFormentor
"So I checked the battery voltage, it's not discharging, clams on the battery seem tight enough too. So maybe it was the cold.",CupraFormentor
I thought it would be but I can’t find the sticker in mine ☹️,CupraFormentor
"I think it just doesn't work well. In another setting, you can define the minimum charge level, but it always goes to 1% anyway.",CupraFormentor
"And to you 🍻

I ordered in December and they estimated Feb/March. I wanted the red of which there weren't any in stock so I was happy to wait but feel it's dragged on a bit. You'd think early March at the latest but here we are.",CupraFormentor
"Completely normal. I'd remove the protective film, though. It's blocking the screen.",CupraFormentor
"One thing to mention, you’ll have to make peace with the fact that the wireless smartphone charging is utterly useless on 95% of modern smartphones. A few people plug in 3rd party ones they’ve bought from Amazon, viable options but I can’t be arsed.",CupraFormentor
"No they’re not working at all, when opening the doors or trying to turn them on manually",CupraFormentor
Thanks for this. I'm hoping it won't be too much longer as it's been 13 days since they told me it had arrived in the UK.  They didn't confirm the date it arrived though so I've no idea how long the dealership has actually been waiting to receive it.,CupraFormentor
"Oh I could be wrong then, I’ll have to check on mine",CupraFormentor
"Vz hybrid is awesome, i dont even think about 310 because i don’t need 310 lol",CupraFormentor
"Salut! That’s just a workaround, but what I want is to permanently disconnect the system. My work phone is an SE, which doesn’t have wireless charging, but the car cooks it every time when I put it there.",CupraFormentor
Thanks. I’ll be sure to check this out!,CupraFormentor
Thank you for your reply.,CupraFormentor
"Didn't know formentors came  with a diesel engine... must be a different market... anyways..

Short trips will absolutely wreak havoc on a diesel engine... biggest and most common issue is the DPF(Diesel particulate filter) getting clogged up, while the engine is running and driving the car will try and clean it by injecting more fuel and increasing the temperature, but you're killing the process before it finishes by turning the engine off, the fans will keep running for a while to cool down the engine otherwise it could cause damage...

Long story short, don't do short trips with a diesel car...",CupraFormentor
"You can coast in Drive as well if you let go the accelerator lightly or tap it. Coasting can be more efficient as engine braking is disabled and you don’t need to use as much fuel to speed up again, except when approaching a stop. This is why Drive will be more efficient if you learn to use it.",CupraFormentor
Didn’t the 1940 infotainment update fix the issues?,CupraFormentor
"We had our Formentor delivered mid September, our son was born a few days later. We have the 1.5 version, so the boot is slightly larger. The bugaboo fox 5 without folding down the bassinet takes up most of the space, and fits just about height wise with the floor in the lower position. My previous car was an estate, so it was a bit annoying at the beginning. On the other hand it is quite roomy on the back seat, and the britax 5z family of car seats fits perfectly.",CupraFormentor
If this is not covered under warranty I don’t know what would be. 👍,CupraFormentor
It’s more functional than pretty but does the job for me. Enough to see where to tap anyway. [picture](https://imgur.com/a/zPDNmSC),CupraFormentor
"Had mine for 15 months. VZx 310HP. 
No problems with car mechanically. Goes hard.
Infotainment issues/errors on dash showing pretty often - 100% down to battery being low, due to it being an issue with the car and my dashcam also contributing. Putting it in a trickle charger overnight will stop all these issues - I don’t get them after a long car run, only when I have not taken it out or just whipped up to the shops quickly.",CupraFormentor
"I was so happy when I got them. I live in a city with many uphills/downhills, and the difference is drastic even during the rain.",CupraFormentor
"Can anyone recommend an app that I can use to play mp3's from my phone via Android auto? I downloaded a couple of players but they don't show up on android auto on the car so I can't control media in my phone through the car controls.

"Got mine this week when there for a different recall check. I had to remind them, but they had them ready and just did it immediately.",CupraFormentor

"I think the washing camera may not be a universal thing. My V2 2023 model camera has no washer built in (like my old MK4 Octavia had) and the rear wash nozzle is built into the wiper for me so no chance any liquid finds it's way to a camera under the boot lid handle to clean it.

ETA: I take it all back, I have NO IDEA where the wash is coming from but right enough if you wash the back window while the camera is on it gets washed! Mind blown, there is also a button that looks like it would be for washing the camera but if I press it I get a ""this function isn't available"" message. I'll take a photo if I remember next time.  Surely would be easier just having a ""wash camera"" button like even other VAG group cars?!",CupraFormentor
Sorry to hear that! Just really unlucky release i guess. The looks and the materials are really good and if not for those issues this car would sell incredibly well imo. Glad you enjoyed your A4. My dad has been driving audi for 25 years now and not a single problem yet,CupraFormentor
I love the car but the infotainment system on mine is horrendous. It can’t handle switching between users and will crash often. I’m also not keen on the lack of physical dials/buttons for the essentials.,CupraFormentor
I was on the phone with 3 people from the local Cupra dealership. They ended the conversation by saying that it was better to come to their garage and solve the problem there 😡,CupraFormentor
"Same here. It’s FINALLY over after countless software updates and even a complete steering wheel swap. Before that it threw all kind of errors and randomly rebooted (of course at the exact moment you’d need sensors or cameras, because Murphy…).

And the foam engine cover that was removed about one and a half year ago and swapped for a solid one just some weeks ago…

VAG seemed not to care about their clients at all, and even though the service from the dealer itself was fine, they couldn’t do much without will or support from the manufacturer",CupraFormentor
What wheels do you have?,CupraFormentor
Check for nails in the tyres. I had to spend £200 on a new tyre the next day 😭,CupraFormentor
"Yes customer service is terrible, and Cupra Dealer in Bristol too. Even can’t provide quote for dash cam installation. Quoted for £299, asked twice them if this price is correct.

"Fair point!! When booking my recall they said if the heat protection mat isn't fitted correctly, it's a risk of a fire.

Now tbh, the last thing I want to do is drive 40miles for a mediocre recall which has no urgency and serious baggage with it, but I think recall information (like the Australian Cupra site) should be transparent for every customer in their own respective countries. Whether that is via an SMS, email, self check via website or UK's very own archaic DVLA.

Some people have airbag issues and whilst Cupra may think it's not urgent, the service for a car may be an entire year away before they can check it. If an accident happens and airbag isn't deployed, it's a case on Cupras head which could've been rectified when they realised it. But as of now customers have no idea unless if they are contacted and by then, it could be too late",CupraFormentor
"I'm on an older version. Love.the car, the estatocs and all, but the system/main panel is useless at the moment. A lot of issues and reboots all the time during a drive.

Also my roof is leaking on the right side. Not sure why, how or where, but it's an issue...",CupraFormentor
"Technically, yes. Because you put something in the way of the flowing air causing more resistance.
Will it result in less mpg? Who knows, maybe a tiny little bit.
But since the Formentor is pretty bad in terms of fuel consumption… who cares? ;-)",CupraFormentor
"I'm 6 months, 10k miles in with 1 minor fault that fixed itself in a day. Love the car, definitely recommend it.",CupraFormentor
"🤦🏻‍♂️ should’ve said. That’s 26,000 miles. I live in the midlands but we do tend to take the dog out various places like woods and things. We live on an estate that’s still being built so had a couple of punctures from nails. The roads haven’t been finished still so going over the raised joins probably hasn’t helped.

Bought the car June/July ’21 I think I did the fronts in Nov ‘22 due to wear being close to the limit and we were just about to go up to the Lake District. Then changed all 4 in July, one of the fronts had a puncture and the rears were getting close to tread limit. There was a discount for doing all 4 at the same time so did it then. I probably could’ve left it a bit longer but with having to replace the punctured one, thought I’d do them at the same time.

The tyres are a bit more expensive to buy but the wear doesn’t feel too different to my last car (Honda Civic). Might just be my driving, and maybe being a bit cautious changing them earlier than I need to.",CupraFormentor

"Try speaking to a different franchise for the dealer. I’m in the midlands, one of the services was £100 cheaper by going to a dealer from a different franchise (still Cupra).

Though I have a nextbase dashcam, I got a USB C to Mini USB cable and just fed it from the USB port in the centre, along the lip above the glove box and up the A pillar and tucked the wires into the trim where I could.

"Yeah I've read nothing but good stuff about BMW's B58/48 engines and they apparently really nailed down how to program the ZF-8 gearbox as well. Wheel size doesn't matter much for me, I currently have '18s on my Focus ST and to me that's the perfect wheel size for a mix of sporty driving and putting around town when you don't have adaptive suspension. I'll probably try to opt for 18/19s on whatever I get.

Your point on sound is a good one, I suppose on the flip side it looks cheaper to get a good aftermarket exhaust for the the 340 than the VZ5 which I will likely want to do on either car to maximize the car's soundtrack in the post-OPF world.",CupraFormentor

In many European countries you need to register ANY modifications on the engine and exhaust because you change emission values (and the power number in your car papers). Otherwise you lose the operating permit for your car. That’s the point when the police gets involved as using a modified car without operating permit (f.e. TÜV/Betriebserlaubnis in Germany) is illegal and they can confiscate your car or/and you’ll get a high fine. 
It differs from country to country and your luck being stopped by the police.",CupraFormentor

Technically, the VZ5 is the sportier car with the torque splitter. It is an RS3 without four rings.

As for economical, mine is probably not as eco as the 150bhp one, but got a solid 36mpg on a 1 and a half hour motorway drive on adaptive cruise control at 75mph.

"Both modes take work to learn how to drive most economically. In eco, you have to learn to lift off and coast much further than you normally would do. Get used to getting quickly up to speed then getting completely off the gas. If you're braking, you're wasting fuel. 
In drive, the engine braking means that while you do stop using fuel when you're off the gas, you can't coast as long. Which one works out better will change depending on the road, the traffic and your driving style. 
I could get an extra few mpg in eco in my old Leon Cupra 290.",CupraFormentor

"One other word on the matte paint.  Get it ppf’d because you scratch it is not repairable.  As in - a: very few body shops have the skills to respray matte paint and b: because it’s so difficult, the likelihood of getting the scratched panel to match the rest of the car is unlikely, meaning the whole car will most likely need to be resprayed.  

So again, get it wrapped.",CupraFormentor

Either way, good that you don't have to pay it and if OP bought a similar year they'd probably not have to pay in either. But if they went brand new, with the current price, I'd presume they would.",CupraFormentor

"Definitely. The 310 is simply a fast car. The 390 is a piece of racing history. 

In that sense, both are overkill for everyday use. The 390 is more fun. It simply needs a lot more rpm. And therefore more fuel.

Have you already test-driven both?",CupraFormentor
Is it the VZ3?,CupraFormentor
"It's capable of self charging, from both regeneration and the engine, even if I have 0 miles range I get over 50mpg and still get the electric boost when I put my foot down. If I drive in hybrid mode with charge I'm normally over 100mpg and I get about 35 miles just on electric with a full charge.",CupraFormentor
"Sure, I'll step back from the financial aspects because these appear to be funded by your parents entirely so don't really factor into your choice either now or in the future for insurance, tax, maintenance, petrol, etc. 

If you've not even passed your test and it simply MUST be a Formentor then for me it's not even a debate. Get the 1.5, it's plenty enough power for a learner to learn out in the real world after they've passed their test. You WILL make mistakes, and a more powerful engine will more often than not amplify your mistake rather than bail you (and anyone else involved) out of it. 

I remember being a cocksure teenager with a fresh licence and you may not want to but you can trade up in 2 or 3 years (or more) to the bigger engines. IMO You will appreciate and understand the power increase ten fold then and be a better safer driver for it.",CupraFormentor

"Short trips and cold weather drain the battery a lot. A tip would be to not use AC for heating the car and only use heated seats. Another thing you could do is set departure times and the car will be fully charged and preheated.
My range during winter is less than 30 km because I only do shirt trips. In the summer is between 40 and 45 km with a maximum of 51 when I really tried to max out the range driving like an old lady.

"If the car is unlocked, you can buy a ""New Identity Set"", 2 key fobs with 2 emergency keys and 2 lock cylinders. If I remember correctly it's around £450-£500 for parts and then you'll have to get it coded at a dealership, depending on the shop they may charge you 1-1.5 hours labor.

If the car is locked, then you'll need to order an emergency key first (the blade in the key fob) to be able to get into the car without damaging anything, then order a new identity set and a new body control module (BCM) which has the immobilizer built into it. that will be an additional £500-£550 for the control unit and roughly £80-£90 for the blade. PLUS the labor which will be an additional 1-1.5 hours to replace the BCM and code it",CupraFormentor

Cupra looks more plastic but Bmw will be pricier. And most likely on a 19 inch wheels while cupra can have 20...

"I have the cupra Leon vz2 got it in may and the infotainment system itself is fine. Nothing great but has everything you need. Only fault really is the touch sensitive controls for air con and volume for example. My issue with the cupra is the interior reading light panel is faulty so after a minute or so of driving it has issues like the readings lights not working which is a huge pain in the ass with these dark nights coz the lights don't come on when you open the doors, any bags or kids that may be in the back are in darkness but it's getting fixed soon. Also it tries to call the sos services randomly. 

My points of concern would be make sure you know the difference between the vz1, 2 & 3 if that's an option with the formentor as I wouldn't like you to pay all that money expecting something you thought was standard as the vz1 is the basic entry level version. I was a little disappointed to find out that the only version of the Leon that has the ""CUPRA"" button on the steering wheel was the vz3... So for me to get the car in it's angriest/fastest mode I need to go thru the many touch sensitive menus. Not exactly convenient when looking to have some fun. 

Good luck !",CupraFormentor
"Had mine 3 months. Best car I've ever owned!!
Over this winter I've had some days when the temp is near 0 when electric range is 18m, but today with a balmy 11C, I got 22!! I'm looking forward to the summer when I hope I'll expect 30+ miles.
Make sure the infotainment software is updated to 1969 version or you'll have no end of problems, I did, the update solved everything.
My only niggle is that swapping between EMode and hybrid requires multiple button presses on the screen, with even more presses if you want to get it in charge whilst driving mode, not easy to do without taking your eye off the road.
I've only ever owned ford 2.0 diesel cars.l, which I thought were nippy -  This accelerates sooo fast with the e-boost, you'll not be stuck with lack of power for overtaking, joining motorway etc.
It costs about £50 to fill up, and with a daily commute of 20 miles + weekend usage, and an overnight charge every night I'm filling the tank every 3 weeks. Saving a fortune in fuel, even taking into account my higher electricity bill.
Also, if you get one, switch to Octopus energy. Their EV tariff is 7p/kWh, so it costs me about 70-80p a night to charge.",CupraFormentor
"The controls are just where you described them (should be the button to the very left there). If they're unresponsive, you probably have a faulty panel. It's a known issue. It'll be replaced under warranty.",CupraFormentor

I have no real issues with my v2 hybrid. The infotainment system does surprising things when we have both our phones around but nothing that would cause any issues. CarPlay isn’t the strongest feature of any car anyway.,CupraFormentor
"I can imagine, from my experience with Cupra Cust Services the best thing I can suggest you do is try and record it happening whenever it happens. With mine, the GPS kept getting lost but because I was using Android Auto/Carplay they were trying to blame the phones, so try and capture it with the built in Nav.

Honestly though, even though I found those issues REALLY annoying, for everything else my ‘21 V2 has been a great car. Now they’ve been fixed on mine I’d happily get another.",CupraFormentor

"You can check if it's updated via the settings on the infotainment system, Google how to do it before you view, there's a lot of menus, better to be prepared!

I had a garage do it, only because of another minor issue it was in for under warranty.
I took photos of the errors I was having and was insistent, so they caved, but I'm led to believe you can do it yourself via a download into usb and stick it in the car. I'm sure there are a few threads on here about it.

Yep even on my V1 190 awd wheel spin and slides on anything other than perfect roads is an everyday occurrence and I don’t have Cupra mode just sport. All so called safety stuff I’ve found totally primitive when compared to Subaru. At first I thought duff tyres - standard Goodyear but no cheap electronics! That’s why it’s probably so much slower down twisty roads.,CupraFormentor
Is there any chance you could post some example pictures or videos? Thinking about getting one but it would have to be able to read license plates with the camera if needed,CupraFormentor
"What others did: a list of software errors, write down every time your multimedia system crashes, reboots etc., with date and timestamp.
Basically to tell them what problems you have, with a written history.
This way, the software update is under warranty.
If not, update appts are quite expensive, because they take so much time.

"That last part is nonsense. I work in insurance, the police have little to do with road accidents for starters, and having a mod does not mean you’re at fault for an accident. The person who was at fault will get the blame, regardless of mods being declared or not. What can happen is your insurer can choose not pay your damages if you were deemed at fault, but again this won’t be affected by an undeclared mod. 

OP, there are plenty of reasons to be sure you tell your insurer about any mods. What fastermaxx is telling you, is not one of them.",CupraFormentor
Mines been in the workshop again for two weeks it’s been updated again. The last time it was updated just over two weeks ago it had to be returned to the garage on a trailer. I’m collecting it tomorrow…”oh sir diagnostics found nothing” (yet again). The biggest mistake I ever made buying it ….3000 miles in 8 months! Unreliable to the max.,CupraFormentor
"Yeah ""all the details"" is actually hardly any details",CupraFormentor
Is the car locked or unlocked?,CupraFormentor
"I got mine second hand at 40000 miles.

Only issues 
Faulty module on transmission (didn't cause any issues or difference in drivability, it just meant an error displayed)

Faulty infotainment system (most common) 

And Faulty air bag system (very rare never seen before, was just a manufacturing issue that went under the quality inspection radar)

All issues got fixed under warranty over 3 days and I was given a curtesy car in the meantime.

As someone who works in a mass production facility of agricultural vehicles, I can understand the issues my car had and how they came to be, especialy taking note that my car/ model was built during the end of the covid pandemic (2021) so there was lots of part shortages, work force lay offs, illness and so many issues the manufacturing scene had to combat if they still wanted to get thier product out. What was important is that my dealership was quick to act on them and get them resolved.

As for design issues that bugged me at first, the climate control temperature adjustment 'buttons' are capacitive (just tap/slide your finger, not an actual button) and they do not light up so you can't really see them when night driving. As first this was a really irritating oversight but after half a year driving the car I know where they are and have no issue using them.

I would suggest test driving the model you want, I have the 204bhp hybrid V1 and I love it. Its hard for me to 'look for my next car' and not just get a newer faster version of what I have now as nothing 'tickles my pickle' like the formentor does.

I'd rate its design

Now, I’ve since had the 1940 update it’s been really consistent, but before it was intermittent. However, the update has made other things worse.

It's a modular portable charger that allows you to interchange between 16A Blue sockets, 32A Red sockets (such as the one displayed), and thermally-monitored 13A domestic adapters (e.g. a UK three-pin Type G or a European Schuko adapter) so you can charge your car in pretty much any scenario. 

Keep in mind that the Formentor can only benefit from a max of 3.6kW charging (or 16A). Products like the Juice Booster can output 11kW or 22kW depending on the model purchased and power source available. The way it could benefit is if you find yourself regularly using the 3-pin charger - because it's a continuous load, the 3-pin charger that Cupra supply is limited to 10A so it doesn't cause an overheat scenario. The Juice Booster has thermal monitoring on its attachments so it can stretch this to 13A for as long as is safe.",CupraFormentor

I just put my phone diagonally and face down so it has some space underneath for heat transfer ☹️,CupraFormentor
Awsome! You will turn some heads! Let us know here after a week or so how she is treating you. Also their should be some ambient lighting if im not mistaken,CupraFormentor
Which I don‘t get how it is mounted to the car if its a AWD Transmission. Is the one side literally empty ?,CupraFormentor
All good. It’s just that you’ve got me worried for a sec. 😂,CupraFormentor
"I think that it wouldn't change anything.
Update from 16xx to 18xx never came as OTA update.
You can only do it in service or by someone who know how to do this.",CupraFormentor
Presume so. Mine is launch edition so just speaking from experience I guess haha.,CupraFormentor
"From economical perspective it’s better you just drive with a less heavy foot than installing the chip. They can not change base engine physics so the gas consumption wouldn’t change noticeably and you need to drive like 100.000km to break even on the costs of the chip with the estimated consumption. 

Also be aware that you loose any manufacturer warranty on your car as they can see you installed a chip even when you remove it later. (Audi even pops up a message on obds when the system notices a manipulation or long term wrong value of any sensors.)
When you ever get into a crash and the police notices that you have a chip that is not written into your car papers, it’s the same as if you were driving without car registration and you‘ll get no insurance.",CupraFormentor
"Also bought one because ive became a father. Not sure about the boot space. I find it very small for luggage and baby stroler. I am struggling with that.

Congratulations!",CupraFormentor
"Oh yeah, it's getting more popular here in the UK but manual cars are still the norm. Enjoy your new car :)",CupraFormentor
"I've raised a child from 0 to 5 yrs old in a Leon with 340 liters boot, so no issue with the capacity.",CupraFormentor
"Majority of the issues i've had with my VZ are related to the SOS system / Networking crashes in poor coverage conditions (my car is in a garage with bad reception) which in turn causes infotainment hangups and other bugs to surface. The 1940 infotainment update feels more stable but it doesn't fix the issue fully. 

For someone working in software my tolerance and understanding for these is fairly high, but when you hit an issue with the infotainment or get random warning lights because software issues is still pretty aggravating. 

The main problem is that the software doesn't properly shut down until you turn off and leave the car for a longer period of time, rebooting the infotainment is not enough to resolve an issue if you hit one. Coming back from a longer pause (going shopping) all lights are gone and things work again. 

I just did a full factory reset and setup from scratch and it also resolved one of my automatic door handle lock opening issues. So that was a software bug too. My hope is that after the reset things improve on the infotainment side.

VAG cars in generally have atrocious software on them, not just the Cupras and these issues are also visible on Audi's, VW's etc. 

So fabulous car, terrible software.",CupraFormentor
"I have the VZ 310 and i love that car. I treat it well and it was always reliable for me. Close to 20k km now and i am in love. The ambient, the sound, the feel, the different modi, it’s just always fun to drive. There were some minor bugs with the infotainment, but otherwise it’s great!",CupraFormentor
"Sorry, can you please explain why you are using usb for music instead of carplay or bluetooth?",CupraFormentor
"is there any official page where to see all the versions and their release notes?

As far as I can remember, I am on 1969 as well, but I didn't get it yet.",CupraFormentor
"I remember fitting those once on an ateca, they're made by THULE I believe (could be cheaper if you buy it directly)

I'm fairly certain that speed limit is with maximum load (size and/or weight) on the bars, and lets be honest, with that load, even 75mph is a bit of a gamble depending on where you drive, one strong gust of wind and you can lose control....",CupraFormentor
"I’m still at a loss. Do you mean the paddle shifters?

Link the image you are seeing.",CupraFormentor
Have you checked the washer hole with a pin to make sure it isn't blocked?,CupraFormentor
"Oh great, you gave me a hope. Yes 1899 version, and there no update available to update. Need go to dealership then 😡",CupraFormentor
"I own a Q2 from 2017, and I've experienced issues with the ACC system turning off, likely due to dirt, especially when traveling at speeds exceeding 140 km/h. :))

Does the 26.000 euro justify the milage of 35000 then?",CupraFormentor
I think it just depended on the dealership they came from really. Was surprised mine came with them and is now a year old and still loving it. ,CupraFormentor
Would very much like to do this as well,CupraFormentor
S24 Ultra - working normally. Wireless AA.,CupraFormentor
"I have a Corolla 2024, and AA keeps disconnecting after 10-20 minutes of use. I've tried so many things, including a factory reset, nothing worked .",CupraFormentor
"I tend to keep it in sport most of the time. Better economy by a few mpg. But more importantly I like the extra acceleration etc - but I’m used to bikes. I find it’s not as good handling as my old Subaru! It can get out of shape if you’re not careful turning right from junctions in the wet, it tries going sideways. Personally I think its tyres (Goodyears are fitted) plus its rear axle tends to move.
Get used to it in normal first then go to hooligan mode!",CupraFormentor
I've been told by mechanics not go to for the hybrid.,CupraFormentor
"Just wanna point out that image is the same one we saw end of last year. I'm wanting to see whether thats what we will get once some more recent images get around. It might be, it might not.

For me, that flat grill looks out of place. It seems others feel the same way. I also think the new EV version takes all the radical creases a bit too far. The Formentor in its current form is way better looking than any of the new designs weve seen so far.

For all current owners we would be more interested in the one that follows this one, i hope they can produce something as fun to look at as our current one. I still get a kick out of looking at my beautiful car each day and its been just about a year already",CupraFormentor
Also a suits the copper accenting,CupraFormentor
The DVLA absolutely won’t just handout owner information to random people. Yes you can do plate lookups on their website and on other websites but the most you’ll get is owner history(not names or addresses) and crash reports etc. If in Finland it’s different that understandable but in the UK and most countries in mainland Europe it’s not a thing and absolutely not to the extent which you’re mentioning,CupraFormentor
"I'd been aware for some time that modern cars don't use fuel when you have the car in gear and the foot off the accelerator, and I make use of that as much as possible, it's just how I drive now.  

It makes no sense to have an economy mode which uses more fuel, and I hate when a car coasts going downhill - it just runs away from you and increases speed.",CupraFormentor
I have hybrid too and hear this sometimes too. I believe it's just the electric motor,CupraFormentor
"The latest update is over the air, no need to go to a dealer. I have the 1.4 e-hybrid and can’t complain. Initially you’ll find the heating and audio controls  annoying, but once you get familiar with the alternatives on the steering wheel you’ll be sweet.",CupraFormentor
"I might be wrong but a lot of negativity I see seems to be from owners of the higher spec models, because at that price point you're competing with BMWs, Audis etc. I have the V1 150hp model so I'm comparing with Nissans, SEATs, KIAs etc. I am totally happy with my choice after over a year of leasing at £280p/m. I can't think of any other car at that budget that has the combination of style, features, and enough practicality that this has. Yes the infotainment can be a little unreliable but it usually sorts itself out after a moment, and I can forgive that when I still look at the car on my drive and smile. I guess it helps that my last car was a very basic Ford Focus estate from 2008 so I appreciate the upgrade.",CupraFormentor
"The Christmas break has broken up the timings for mine arriving at port to being delivered, but to hazard a guess I’d say 2-3 weeks tops.

My Cupra Leon finally arrives on Monday!",CupraFormentor
"I have used charging stations outside but it never overheat.
I want to have a charger which can charge faster. 
With normal connector it takes more than 8 hours for full charge.",CupraFormentor
"If you're like me you'll soon want to turn off the wake word for voice assist. Too many times we were having a conversation and it pipes up saying ""sorry, I didn't hear you properly"" because it thought we said ""hola hola"" or whatever it was. Apart from that, no tips other than try not to spend too much time grinning and staring at it, as it is lovely.",CupraFormentor
What dealer are you taking  it to?,CupraFormentor
50$/year seems fair enough honestly.. thought it was more. Might give this a try if the rest does not work..,CupraFormentor
Unhelpful comment,CupraFormentor
"I can vouch for miltek sports , sounds good its stainless steel made in UK , never rusts and also looks good , the only downside is it will cost you around 3000 euros or you may be lucky and find it at a good price. Just search on google. Good luck .",CupraFormentor
"You can remove it, first time installing was a bit scary, but after you understand how to do it it’s easy",CupraFormentor
Yes Im considering the Toyota Kluger,CupraFormentor
"My Formentor was delivered in July '23. The Panoramic Roof has not Made any sounds or problems at all. No Water is Leaking in. Since I store my Car in a Garage it might be better. 

But especially on warm summer Nights the open Roof makes the car very luxurios.",CupraFormentor
"The left slide button, and just push and hold an arrow for 1 sec.",CupraFormentor
"Technically you will get updates via the esim, yes.  
For me personally, it worked only one time (while almost bricking my entertainment system) and never again.  
Also, since the car on the image is on german export plates: depending on the country you are in now, maybe it is not covered by Cupra Connect. You should check that.",CupraFormentor
"Yes, a portion of the battery remains unavailable for managment and to be ready as boost",CupraFormentor
Thanks. I drive a V2 model so it should get thirsty but that's something I can live with. More interested in knowing if it will handle the weight well.,CupraFormentor
"Yeah, I've experienced an Audi TTRS from the passenger's seat and that 5-cylinder is really a tremendous experience. I was really happy when the VZ5 came out, making it finally attainable in a car that I can afford and that doesn't have the motor hanging too far over the front axle.

I drive a 6-speed manual now, and going automatic is already causing me to rethink the decision sometimes, so if I do pull the trigger I would really like something that still has some feedback on offer when shifting. The DSG sounds like the better option in that regard.",CupraFormentor
Thank you! Seems like after one or two weeks the car decided to do the bigger 1940 update on esim so everything good!,CupraFormentor
How is your interior light set? Maybe if you play around with that. Other than that I have no idea tbh.,CupraFormentor
We have a 2023 2.0 awd. Goes great and turns heads,CupraFormentor
"Get the 1940 software update and its golden.

That version fixes most bugs, I've not had any issues since. Car performs beautifully and I love it.",CupraFormentor
Basically they want to exchange the ‘main brain’ as they put it. Then any faults if they show will be with that individual part! I’ll find out exactly next week…..or not,CupraFormentor
"Seat/Cupra cars tend to have louder road noise than its other similar counterparts from VWAG, why that is I don’t know.",CupraFormentor
"That’s a pity! I still can’t decide over these 2 options. The 2,5L seems like an overkill.",CupraFormentor
That explains sooo much 😔,CupraFormentor
"Thanks, good to know it isn’t a blanket problem!",CupraFormentor
Sweet it works with the lower panel ignition too!,CupraFormentor
Wow! Never knew that either! Thanks!!,CupraFormentor
Tech grey have one. Looks stunning in the cold winter mornings.,CupraFormentor

Beautiful! Great look! Enjoy!,CupraFormentor
Mph or mpg?,CupraFormentor
My car told me i should go for an oil change at about 22.500 km. Although i have the VZ310 model. Not sure why that differs between cars.,CupraFormentor
"Yeah thanks for input, im selling car 100 percent. Dont have energy and time to visit local dealers and be without a car.",CupraFormentor
Have the exact same problem with mine. Just had a cupra technician look at the car and he has ordered me a whole new unit. Hes put it down to a bad soldering job on the circuit board which is causing the metal on the board to contract in different temperatures and press against the buttons,CupraFormentor
"Yeah mines coming up to 3 years old and I had the update done in August last year. Fair bit of frustration up til then. 😂 I think the dealership said it was a recall when they did mine, but had to be done by them rather than OTA.

Honestly though, for all the grumbles I’ve had about the software, the car itself has been good as gold since day one. I do love mine, I just want a VZ now haha.",CupraFormentor
Are you guys all have also panoramic sunroof?,CupraFormentor
"I ordered a Leon e hybrid 245 at the end of August 2023. One month later I got a call that it was scheduled. Another month later that it was on its way from Matorel to Germany. At the beginning of December, they told me to send the money and insurance details. Mid December, I picked up the car. At no point was I in formed what stage the cat was in, so I guess once it's scheduled, it's only a matter of time until it is done. The rest is transit and sitting in the dealers lot.",CupraFormentor
"Haha, thanks!
Just hope this video encourages others to add some cool content to the subreddit.",CupraFormentor
"I'll look into it. The 190s are dirt cheap, a 2-3yo one costs about 26-27k€ which is a really good deal. Then again, a brand new 150 costs about 28k€, plus it has the newer infotainment system, which seems a bit better than the old one. I've also looked into other brands, but I'm not really that interested.",CupraFormentor
"Dealer could do it, but you could also DIY it. It’s rather simple process.",CupraFormentor
"Bought the Polo before having children, so now I needed a Babybomber

It was used, 6 months & 1000km, so... it was almost new

Funny enogh it's Number 310  (PS of the VZ)",CupraFormentor
"I agree with you. That is why I that's why I chose white, and they had it in stock so I did not have to wait. This green look amazing.",CupraFormentor
If you are still under warranty I'd make a claim ASAP. Let them figure out what's wrong.,CupraFormentor
"Had the same issue, started to appear after a few months. Dealer struggled to locate the issue and I had to bring it in countless times before CUPRA finally acknowledged it as a known issue and provided the dealer with instructions of how to fix the issue. The dealer then took me into their workshop and showed me how they had to strip the entire roof and drill new holes and bolts into the plating to prevent the plates from making the noise. Crazy for a new car and this price if you ask me…

After that, I still had countless other issues with various (plastic) parts of the interior that came loose and started rattling at various points in time which the dealer had to fix one by one.

Tired of the lack quality of in the car’s construction and interior, but at the same time still love the looks and feel of the car!",CupraFormentor
Did it come like that or did you get the lower parts painted?,CupraFormentor
If you find it I’d be grateful if you let me know where it was on yours. Looked everywhere on mine! Thankfully someone has posted them on here,CupraFormentor
"Have had my 245  petrol VZ2 since March and done about 6k miles. 

No major issues with it at all. Had two infotainment resets in that time and the sat nav through a wobble once. Funny enough when taking a friend to a Seat/Cupra dealership as one wasn't used to. Left the car and was fine after. 

Myself has been a great car and love anytime using it. Perfect for long distance on motorways and more so on fun A and B roads.",CupraFormentor
"When im charging mine at a public station usually i connect the cable (light turns yellow because no power is supplied yet), then i authorize the payment on app, then chatging station starts charging and light turns green. Also if this is not working for you you can try also pushing a bit on the type 2 connector, i saw posts about cars that could not lock in correctly the connector and thats why it cannot start the charging. Worth trying",CupraFormentor
I don't seem to be able to change any light settings. How can I check this? The symbol near the lights that has an open door is orange so I'm presuming it's off but I can't seem to turn back on.,CupraFormentor
I've found 38 too low. I run 40.,CupraFormentor
Literally anyone that even barely cares about vehicle safety.,CupraFormentor
Thanks! Any chance you know the model name of the bars when they are Thule branded?,CupraFormentor
"Did not know that. Thank you for the info.

By the way, Spain and Portugal also have 120 limit",CupraFormentor
"This was an extreme test as i mentioned i deliberately try to make the most of it, I went on an open clear road and managed to make it stable at 80kmph when on 2 cylinders when it hit that number but it was just for couple of seconds so it is not a real use case, normally I don't care about this and it is mostly around 9l mark.
And when driving economically, it gets from 5.5-6l, but that is when traffic is really low and a good road on 2 cylinders.

If I'm ever on the same situation, I'll remember the thread and take a picture.",CupraFormentor
How do you enable it??,CupraFormentor
I think it means to say check the vehicle wallet for the manual for more information but instead of informing you of all of that it just shouts in a Tourette’s style manner at you.,CupraFormentor
"If you have the opportunity to tell how, I will be very happy. I just can't find it, even though I thought I looked everywhere.",CupraFormentor
"That's not how the hybrid works, it always has power available by design.",CupraFormentor
"Yes, no.",CupraFormentor
I kinda like it,CupraFormentor

What is yours about?",CupraFormentor
Useful info. Thanks. Which version do you own?,CupraFormentor
"As others said it's the particle filter, all modern diesels do that. It's not a problem, but try doing as few short trips as you can, diesel is not made for that.",CupraFormentor
"I can sorta answer this. 

We have a VZX and 330i.

The Cupra is more fun to drive in the city. It’s a bit unrefined and just fun to bag around. 

Everything else is better about the BMW. Fit and finish, comfort, road manners, reliability, dealer experience, ageing… you name it, the BMW drives circles around the Cupra. Assisted driving tech is a massive win for the BMW too, as the Cupra is a nightmare even with just radar cruise (it usually follows the next lane over and slams on the brakes or accelerator regardless of what’s happening in your lane). 

I don’t regret buying the Cupra, but I definitely won’t keep it for my normal 3 years and would go to BMW first when it’s time to be replaced.",CupraFormentor
"Check that your infotainment is upgraded to at least version 1940. As you mention it's new - it should already be that version or newer. 


If it isn't, set up a main profile and set your privacy setting to allow internet connection. You may get a few OTA updates on route to 1940. 


If it doesn't automatically upgrade to 1940, get the dealer to upgrade it. 


There's major issues below version 1940. ",CupraFormentor
I don’t think it has a specific name. As to how it works the owner’s manual explains it: https://www.manualslib.com/manual/2040432/Cupra-Formentor.html?page=219,CupraFormentor
"I have a 310hp version that I got a few months ago. At first I had some issues like most of us with the infotainment system, but after the 1940 OTA its like a totally new car and I’m loving it. My car came without an engjne cover, visited the dealership and  they gave me a fresh onefree of charge.",CupraFormentor
"Someone posted a photo of one wrapped in bright green the other day. That's the colour I'd go for. But out of those two, the sandstorm is nicest.",CupraFormentor
"Personally I think the hybrid is probably the best option, 245bhp is plenty and traction becomes the issue rather than lack of power.

Since the update I've not had any issues with the infotainment system, it seems to be working perfectly.",CupraFormentor
"My condolences... I'm tired of various problems with this car, and I've been using it for less than a year.",CupraFormentor
Shift-by-wire,CupraFormentor
This.,CupraFormentor
I also have the same one! Reckon it would look a bit silly to copper colour the muffler tips?,CupraFormentor
"I believe they do supply you with that option however if you can find a free fuse slot I'd much rather go with that. My fuse box is under the drivers wheel, I fed cables up drivers side pillar to headboard and then to dash cam thats mounted to rear view mirror, extra wire I cable tied together and hid in a empty Cavern like tucked in the headboard or pillar. The rear view camera I ran along the headboard to the back of the car, through the rubber grommet into the boot door and then stuck it to the boot door glass on the inside.

You can also splice into your Reversing lights cable so the dash cam knows when you are Reversing and activates customisable Reversing lines but I didn't bother.",CupraFormentor
"Can't post pic, but you can find info in user manual under ""Launch control"".",CupraFormentor

Got it as well. No regrets!!,CupraFormentor
Did you sort it out ?,CupraFormentor
Good luck with the new car!,CupraFormentor
The Bupra owners will all be pissed at this one. Looks like that has already begun. 😂,CupraFormentor
"Basically I need something that is bearable as a daily driver/family hauler, but is engaging and can serve well as the occasional mountain road carver and can take a few relaxed laps at a track here and there.

What would you see as the biggest differences between the two?",CupraFormentor
"I did, nothings changed",CupraFormentor
