"Older caravans are notorious for sliding door issues. You‚Äôre either dealing with a bad sliding door latch assembly, one of the cables for the sliding door latch or the handle is stretched / damaged, and or a wiring issues along the sliding door track. I‚Äôve found the wiring gets caught in the sliding door track and the door functions will cease to work, other times it‚Äôs a bad cable or latch / lock actuator (locking issue). The static could vary a loose / dirty ground for the radio or check your exterior antenna on the passenger front exterior may need to be replaced if it‚Äôs damaged. You could try and bring the vehicle to the dealer to see if your vehicle has the extended warranty extension for the lock actuator but you will have to have it diagnosed first for them to determine if your vehicle is eligible. Be ready to be quoted a glass track bracket and exterior trim bezel for the door trim to access everything.",Dodge

"This never was going to exist. It was really just marketing for the last call wave of cars.

"The HEMI is moreso a name nowadays rather than an actual engine type, the name comes from the old v8 blocks that had hemispherical combustion chambers instead of the relatively flat chambers of nowadays. The v6 never got the hemi name because A: its their economy picking B: its featured in multiple non-sport models in the chystler umbrella, and C: its not a v8 like the engines the HEMI name is derived from.




Tldr: HEMI is the name derived from old v8 blocks, thus, the v6 doesnt get the name.",Dodge
No talks that I know of but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs on the table,Dodge
"Pretty much.  But even with the Kia lawsuit.  The only reason they settled like they did was because it was cheaper than the lawyer and there was proof in how easy it was to defeat the starting mechanism.  

If this lawsuit doesn‚Äôt have a ton of evidence that Chrysler knew how easy it was to steal the vehicles or similar they won‚Äôt get anything.  Hell Kia almost had the class action lawsuit thrown out then a shit ton of TikTok‚Äôs and you tube videos showing how easy it is to make the device to bypass the switch was.  And that hurt their case and they were like fuck it let‚Äôs offer a credit for a steering wheel lock.  And the plaintiffs were like well that‚Äôs probably our best case scenario.  That was not a high dollar pay out for any one individual.

In fact the only people that really get anything out of most class action lawsuits are lawyers profiting off the hardship of others.",Dodge

Not at the volume of the previous gen . The new ones start out at 420 HP  with twin turbo engines. There is no base or entry level versions for ppl just looking for transportation. These are the cars that keep the lines running.,Dodge
This is true everyone gets intimidated seeing my charger. But it is the top police car chargers are so that‚Äôs a big reason.

"Didn't sell as well.

At the time, the general population didn't have (technically still doesn't) have a love affair for wagons. The Magnum got a bit of a boost in sales when the HEMI got stuffed in it.

But the market LOVES the idea of an SUV. Despite how stupid it is to lift items four feet off the ground and into the trunk instead of two, but I digress.

Between that and the fact the Challenger was right around the corner ment the slowest seller had to go in order to put another vehicle on the line at Brampton.",Dodge

Yeah. That‚Äôs why im wondering if it‚Äôs electrical related. On other cars that I‚Äôve seen have a bunch of random things throw codes. It has always been a low voltage issue. I would volt meter the battery and see if it‚Äôs above 12 volt with the truck off and around 14.1 with it running and no accessories. Check your grounds too. A loose ground can also cause weird things to happen like pulsing lights and erratic readings on your trucks volt gauge,Dodge

"What are the sales numbers for v6 vs v8 (both including and not including fleet/police, etc.)?

¬†

There should still be an v8 option, maybe smaller displacement, but still available, as Ford still has the v8 mustang. It what sets Dodge apart from the others, and the rumble makes you stand out. 

Now if you want a v8 sedan, you need an import. Still feel like somethings missing with the lack of a v8 with the new Charger, regardless of the I6 specs. The v8 gave the charger a unique character. Perhaps it will be added back in a few years.

"The truck isn‚Äôt parked there lol, that‚Äôs just the best picture I have of it (I‚Äôm buying it off a guy at work, this is from when he brought it for me). But yeah, I should have taken videos or something. As for an old truck, If I could find a carbureted truck I would totally get it but all that I‚Äôve been able to find have been sitting for years and I don‚Äôt really have time or patience for that kind of project. I‚Äôve driven it a couple times and nothing seems to be broken, clutch feels good and the brakes are pretty responsive. 

It‚Äôs just gonna be a shitty little work daily until I can get something nicer, so I‚Äôm not too concerned with  longevity or anything, I plan on driving it until it doesn‚Äôt feel like driving anymore. I could hypothetically buy something nicer for a little more money but that would run up my budget completely and I want money left over to do full maintenance and for gas. I like that truck but I also wish something better would come up lol.

That being said, I‚Äôm not familiar with the motors or transmissions of these trucks (or dodges in general) so I don‚Äôt really know how reliable they are. I assume it can‚Äôt be terrible, it‚Äôs pretty hard to mess up an i4 but as for the transmission I‚Äôm clueless.

"It's not a V6, it's Mopar's version of the 2JZ. Twin turbo 3.0 straight six with either 450 or 550hp. Jeep has had it in the Grand Wagoneer for a year now. New Ram 1500s will have it in place of Hemi. It is apparently quite potent.",Dodge
Probably not. Rear wheel drive is not as forgiving when you make a mistake. I can think of a couple of times when I dodged (heh) a deer in that car and if I was in a Charger/Challenger I probably would have spun out and got totaled by the semi that was right behind me.,Dodge

"I know a lot about these 3.6 pentastars.  My 3.6 went to 200k miles before the timing chain tensioner broke.  

Issues you will run into if you haven't already:

-Oil cooler housing gasket will leak oil on top of your engine.

-rocker arms will come loose and make a loud ticking noise

-Radiator will leak coolant
 
-abs pump(you already know)

-timing chain tensioner will break eventually, new one comes with timing chain kit.

-PCV valve on back of passenger side valve cover will fail.

-Some people have had their flywheel crack/break with transverse versions 

I opened my motor up at 200k miles and there was little carbon build up and the cylinder walls were immaculate.  

With regular maintenance, this motor has been documented going 600k miles, opened up and still having immaculate cylinder walls.

"The only differences apart from the styling are the transmission and the power steering. The newer one has an 8-speed and electric power steering and the old one has a 5-speed and hydraulic power steering.

If you‚Äôre looking to maximize speed, the old transmission will be a handicap. You could look for an R/T with the Super Track Pack which came with a 3.09 final drive, but the new ZF has three more gears and shifts faster. And if the slightly lazier gearing in the new transmission is a problem for you, you can swap in the 3.06 LSD from a Scat Pack.

I went with a ‚Äò14 because I prefer the styling inside and out and because the electric steering feels numb on the newer ones. The old 5-speed shifts quickly enough, but it would be nice to have like *one* more gear in this thing.",Dodge

"If you have a hemi, the only way to inspect the lifters properly would be to remove the cylinder heads. So they're asking for ""tear down"" and assuming the labor rate is close to Maybe 200$ per hr (or less, or more) then that's about 5ish hours of diag. 

Which is about right for removing both cylinder heads on a hemi.

If it's a 3.6L then you can see the lifters and rockers by popping off the valve covers and inspecting from there which should be around 3-4ish hrs. 

And the 1200 SHOULD go towards the repairs if you choose to follow through with it.",Dodge

"I think the lack of a ""base model"" will do way more to hurt sales than a Hemi. There's no way a 420HP TTI6 performance full size liftback sedan will be under $50k, and given the last Charger started sub-$40k idk what that will mean for the low-end sales (the V6 Chargers sold best for a reason) unless the Hurricane 4-cylinder from the Giulia and Grecale comes to the Charger in future model years. Same goes for the Daytona, standard dual-motor is rarely a thing even on high-end EVs so I can't help but think we'll see a de-contented RWD single-motor Daytona with a smaller battery in a few years to lower the price floor once production is able to ramp up.",Dodge

"Just do it all at once. Trying to nickel and dime an engine build is a good recipe for doing it all over again, costing you a lot of $$$. Do it right the 1st time. If the $7k is your final out the door bill, then that sounds reasonable. If it's just the engine cost and they are charging an extra couple Grand for install/fluids/etc, then it's not.

I could have switched to a scat when I traded my 5.7 challenger in 3 weeks ago, but didn‚Äôt want to pay the extreme asking price they wanted for new scats with the upgraded interior. I was dead set I was NOT trading for something that already had the same exact features/interior I already had just for the extra HP I‚Äôll never use.  I traded for another 5.7 but a charger Daytona with all that beautiful alcantara/napa goodness. I wouldn‚Äôt buy a used scat after seeing how some are treated on social media lol.

If you want more power go hellcat lower airbox, long tube headers, cam and a tune. Anything more than that and the engine and transmission are going to pop.",Dodge
"It's not 1980 anymore, the only modern turbocharged time bombs are the EJs. The boost being around 26psi just tells me that they're using small turbos and not really moving a lot of volume. This engine will most likely be reliable so long as you keep up on the Italian tune ups (don't let carbon build up) seeing as its D.I only",Dodge
"As far as I know the Pentastar isn't going to be discontinued, so they could still potentially offer cheap V6 Chargers in the future just like they do today. They only announced the high performance stuff to get the news going.",Dodge

If you can afford and maintain it then go for it.,Dodge
"It could be a lot of things.  My charger was going into limp mode randomly and after taking it a few different places who had no luck and the same dealership 3 different times they finally figured out the wire going from the crank position sensor had the wrong connection and when the engine got hot it was shorting out.  But before they figured that out they had no clue and said it could‚Äôve been a huge number of things.

Abs isn‚Äôt connected to your power train, so it seems kind of weird that would cause it, but with how modern cars are I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs thinking your brakes are unsafe and going into limp mode.  Or it could be something else.  No way for anyone on reddit to know.",Dodge
"This is true. I was looking more at the logistical reasons no one would want one. The infrastructure to support a mass number of EVs just isn't there in a lot of places. Besides that they are incredibly expensive to buy, and while they don't require as much immediate maintenance as an ICE vehicle, more often than not the maintenance they do require is expensive and can't be performed by your average tech center grad like an ICE vehicle can be. Those issues, along with performance, will definitely kill that line in a couple of years, failing major changes in our infrastructure and maintenance capabilities",Dodge
"2018 would be the best year because you‚Äôll have apple car play which is do or die in modern automobiles, they just feel archaic without it.

As ypur a reddit mechanic, I suggest you jack the back of the car up and remove the three bolts on each side of the active exhaust housing and remove the springs completely.  Then, push the arm of the valve towards the rear of the car. That's the fully open position. Take a standard black zip and tighten down the valve actuation arm in place fully open. Cut the ziptie and re install the hoisting and three bolts. The motor will still move the actuators but no spring to move the valves.

"That was the vibe I got from my conversation with them as well. They've never charged more than the quoted price, and a couple of times knocked some money off because it was faster or easier than anticipated. When they give me a number that's what it'll be, $7k for parts, build, fluids and installation. 

They also don't intend to use a crate engine. They want to build me one themselves, they do crate engines but they know me, and seem to like me quite a bit when I come in. Their truck guy also seems to really like my van. Them building it gives me confidence because they work pretty hard to ensure anything they touch doesn't need to be touched again for a long time, and they're the kind of shop that if something breaks that they just worked on they will make it right on their dime. 

They quoted 8k to replace my husbands hyundi engine with a pre-built (which was 4k less than the dealer quoted) And it's much easier to replace that engine than mine.

Plan wise as it stands is they have a parts list saved, and I have been given the instructions to drive the engine into the ground because it could last a few months or hold out much longer. When it's struggling too badly I should bring it in, or if it dies they'll come and fetch it. They said it won't hurt anything to drive it until it fails or I decide to get it done, whichever comes first, and if it's being replaced there's no reason not to. 

They have always done right by me, I just figured I should reach out, I don't have anyone who knows vehicles to ask for advice or opinions from aside from my mechanic, and 2nd opinions from people not getting paid for it is always a smart move.

It was a decent unit for its time. Of course you are talking about something Mopar stole out of the Daimler parts bin when they were merged. It dates to 1996. You are looking at a design that is coming on 30 years old. There is better technology available now. The ZF 8HP is both quicker and more economical. 

Put it this way. The newer 8-speed 370hp 5.7 Hemi equipped Chargers do 0-60 in the low 5s. I've personally managed 5.1 on the stock 245 width tires.  The older 5-speed SRT8s with 425hp 6.1 Hemis are good for 0-60 in the high 4s. So that 8-speed very nearly makes up for a 55hp difference... that's huge.

And some folks may not want to admit it, but it's an ancient and pretty lackluster engine these days. It's 5.7L, debuted two decades ago, and made essentially modern 6-cylinder power. It was time for it to be put out to pasture. The 392 really wasn't much better in being dated. It's fairly large displacement for a modern engine, but makes less HP (more torque though) than the 5.0 Coyote in the Dark Horse. Objectively, Dodge's non-supercharged offerings really weren't all that competitive in the modern landscape. Cool for sure, but not competitive.",Dodge

Essentially, the only reason I'd opt for the Golf is if you live in a dense urban area where tight parking and smaller roads are an issue. The Golf is a cool performance car that also fits in a city setting while the ""boat"" moniker is well-deserved for Dodge cars. Go with the Golf if you care about gas mileage as well, but if you're considering the Charger, then I assume you aren't. 

If space and gas mileage aren't issues, then I'd go Dodge all the way (take into account that this is coming from a Dodge stan on a Dodge subreddit). They're roomy, comfortable, stylish, they turn heads, and they have an awesome exhaust note even with a factory exhaust.

"All (4) wheel drive. Four wheels, contacting the road, powered, hence ""four on the floor"". Your average LX/LD car with a hemi is only RWD, meaning you only get 2 wheels actually putting power to the road. Because these cars are so heavy and have tiny tires stock, you waste a lot of power spinning your wheels ineffectually when launching (this is also why wider rear tires are a popular mod, and why widebody versions exist. More contact surface area = more grip = better launch)

All AWD cars launch better than RWD cars pound-for-pound and HP-for-HP due to having twice as many tires physically transmitting energy to the pavement. AWD doesn't give you more power, but it lets you use the power you have available much more efficiently",Dodge
"There are a lot of exhaust options out there. My '22 R/T has active exhaust and with valves open the tone and volume are pretty satisfying to me.

We won't live long enough to see that. How are we updating the grid?

"The 6.4 as furnished was built to provide better economy (fuel mileage) so engineering compromises were made in the design in the pistons and rings to provide lower friction while running. 

Those parts (as furnished OEM) are not best suited to operate under increased combustion pressure, as they would be subjected to under your 'boosted' idea. 

You would be up against the ragged edges of catastrophic failure (worst case) or decreased engine/component life (best case).

"I love my Scat. It's super fun to drive, and it would be fine as a daily. The car I picked up is Go Mango with a shaker hood, tailstripe, and hood pins.. So it looks like it should be fast.. It goes OK, but honestly, I am kind of used to it now.. I grew up as a kid with my uncles and cousins having muscle cars from the late 60s and early 70s. My Challenger looks like they did, so I needed it to feel like those cars did when I was a kid. Raw, loud, and not afraid to get the tail loose.. I had driven bothe the SXT and R/T as rentals, and they both felt pretty good, but they just didn't give me the same feeling as the Scat. The 6.4 is a gem, the suspension is taught as it should be in a muscle car, it's got a posi ass end and a stick, and while I only have the 4 piston Brembos, they will put you through the windshield if I hop on them. The car just feels like a special car, and this is what I was looking for out of the experience. I don't want  to drive a Hellcat because bad things will happen to my finances.

Also regular oil changes, while still very important, won't prevent this from happening.

"Like a movie script.

2021 Hellcat Durango. They took it from my parking garage in San Diego in December.. Broke the back window to access the cpu and cloned a key. Got into a shootout on the freeway with a charger hellcat. Drove to LA where lapd spotted ""suspicious"" looking individuals in ski masks getting in it. Tried to pull them over, high speed chase ensued. Crashed and were caught. I was in San jose at the time(live in sj, apartment in SD) when sjpd made contact with me in, two weeks later in january.

Impounded in La, then turned over to San Diego pd for an investigation. Then to highway patrol for the freeway shooting. Also, had to be returned to lapd for a possible homicide. It's now a federal case, they know all the players, and the cars are crossing state and and international lines. It's going federal, because the thieves keep getting released. 

So, two months of impound, still making payments because insurance couldn't see the vehicle yet. An absolute ish show!

Good news, insurance gave me 100k(owed 38) and my local dealership where I get all my cars, just got in a 24 Hellcat Durango. I picked it up! 

As a lifelong mopar guy with several new and old cars, this still infuriates me!

"Well, it‚Äôs as safe in a crash (AT THE SAME SPEED) as a normal Charger or Challenger because it has to be.

"RWD substantially simplifies this problem because you aren't dealing with the relatively fragile AWD t-case and associated subsystems. The engine and tranny should drop in with minimal if any modification depending on the year of your 300. The problem is with everything that comes *after* that. At minimum, you would want to swap out your rear diff even on a RWD car.

With an AWD car, you've got twice as many halfshafts and diffs plus a transfer case that is absolutely not ready for hellcat power.

"I would go with the Charger R/T personally.  I have two hemi powered cars and they are a great reliable motor. It is probably one of the most reliable engines Dodge has built.

I have not owned a VW in nearly 20 years after owning several and vowing to never get another German car ever again. I'll leave it at that.

J.D. Power ranks each manufacturer by 'Problems per 100 Cars'.  Dodge ranks at #10 out of 29, and Volkswagen is almost right at the bottom at #26 out of 29 manufacturers with 267 problems per 100 vehicles sold.  Volkswagen has held that bottom position for decades.

I have a 2006 Magnum R/T and love it. The 5.7 is a reliable motor and tons of fun to drive. The only issue is that the suspension wears out quick, I'm not sure if that's been resolved with the newer models or not.

I also have a 5.7L older Gen Durango with 416,000 km(265k mile) and have had zero engine issues.  The only breakdown I've had since I bought it new was the fuel pump last year. Other than that, she fires up and runs every single time.  Dependable as fuck!",Dodge

It‚Äôs also NOT going to appeal to the people that buy the v6s of today because it‚Äôs going to cost as much as the v8. You‚Äôre pricing out the v6 buyers and alienating the v8 buyers.

The engine internals just aren‚Äôt made to handle it and you would have to rebuild it from the ground up. Plus, the transmission in that model is only built to handle that low horsepower range and you would have to upgrade that as well.

When the manager called and yelled at you, you should have said 'I don't need to be treated like this by someone who wants me to spend sixty grand at his business' and hung up.",Dodge
"Probably not. In recent years, sales of the V6 have been going up. The Hemi versions are still high profile, but aren't nearly as common as people think. Based on trends, I'd say they are going to lose the hard-core V8 or Bust crowd, but the vast majority that want a Charger will buy the V6. What's gonna hurt their sales, imo, are the electric models. Despite pushes to make EVs more acceptable, they still aren't favored as much as ICE vehicles. I forsee one or two years of low sales of the EV, and then they will be discontinued. This is assuming there isn't a major legislation that makes the purchase of EVs either more alluring or outright necessary",Dodge

Used hellcat drivetrain is 10k$-20k$ on ebay depending on mileage.

Quality of build and installation is the other question? From this picture, the hood and bumper fitment look clean. If you could get at 30k$-35k$, it would be a great deal.

Know anyone who cleans up flood cars for resale? Ask them what it would cost to go over all your wiring connections to look for bad spots and use ?dielectric grease? on the connection points cleaning everything up.

I couldn't get mine to reset and had to spend extra on the wiper control arm because it froze but really wanted to go.

Even if they have the information they won‚Äôt go recover the vehicle. A friend of mine had a gps locator thing on his truck.  It got stolen and as they were filling out paperwork on it being stolen it was showing up in a lot across the road from the police station.  Looked out a window.  Saw his truck.  Pointed it out to the cop.  Cop said no way to know it‚Äôs yours.  He had the key and set off the panic alarm.  Cop shrugged said it wasn‚Äôt his job to recover he just filled out paperwork for insurance companies to pay out.,Dodge

It's possibly but you need to get this OBD device that allows it to happen.  Should be easily findable in any youtube video that explains the process,Dodge
Nice car! My first car was a 2010 dodge avenger rt. Got it with 90k miles back in 2017. Still have it and now I'm at 270k miles and I use it as my daily. I'm never letting that car go.,Dodge
Nah it‚Äôs on both sides that isn‚Äôt gum lol,Dodge
The dealership can pay one bill or two.  Time to lawyer up.,Dodge
The wheels from the Dodge viper pretty much from every generation bolt to that truck and yes they do fit in the wheel wells without modification. Have fun üòÅ,Dodge
"It's a conspiracy that someone who worked at the dealership stole it, but soonly after my Father's 2016 Charger Hellcat was turned in, it got stolen.

And Dodge really sort of fucked my Father over, and it was a very circumstantial mess. 

He went through a few sets of tires. Replaced the rotors at one point (I'd assume pads too). This is within 45k miles. And he may have done pulls, but he didn't usually do burnouts. I think he had to replace some sort of pump (I don't remember which one).",Dodge
"MT website doesn't work that great on my phone so I can't see all the information. I can't find any information on tread life either.

Also I meant to say the Nitto NT555 G2, not the R2s as those are drag radials.",Dodge
That color looks nice,Dodge
"Doesnt matter wat factory builds them. Hurricane is an expansion of Stellantis ""global four cylinder"" design, used by Fiat and Alfa. It's an *Italian* engine, and Italian cars are not known for their reliability.",Dodge
"And the same would‚Äôve applied to the Hemi so there would have been no price differential between the two if they had chosen to keep it around then. If that was your point, then cool I guess we agree, inflation would be the cost driver, not engine choice.

However it‚Äôs hard to ignore your original comment which was ‚Äútwin turbo 6 cylinder which will cost more than a v8‚Äù which mentions nothing about input costs and clearly points to engine choice and design as the cost driver.",Dodge
Companies pay $$ for data.,Dodge
Probably something going on with the canbus... I'd do diagnostic code checks on the radio (alfaobd allows me to do this but dealer could do this also),Dodge
Got a kid? Get a minivan. The extra space and convenience makes your life so much easier. Sure looking cool is fun but it damn sure is not as practical and convenient. You trying to impress people or make your life easier?  It‚Äôs that simple.,Dodge

"I believe lemon law only applies to the original purchaser as well. Essentially you bought a used car that‚Äôs no longer under warranty and put 15k miles on it. If you had only put like 1k miles on it and it broke I could seeing being upset that maybe a known issue was hidden from you. You‚Äôve put what amounts to a year or more worth of miles on it for most people though. You were unfortunately just hit with some expensive bad luck. Get a quote from an independent shop, as the dealer is taking you over the coals.",Dodge
"As I alluded to before,  it seems your argument is that it will be more expensive simply due to inflation and not because the I6 is a more expensive engine for Stellantis than the Hemi. Thanks for pointing out the obvious reality that inflation exists I guess, but it doesn't really have much to do with the discussion at hand...

Not to mention inflation would've made the V6 more expensive as well.",Dodge
"A reputable auto accident lawyer will guide you, it should be fairly easy to squeeze another vehicle out of the dealer & some cash for the lawyer",Dodge
"You really need to find someone with a good scan tool like autel, this way they can see which cylinders are misfiring and diagnose it much easier and faster. So if they are all misfiring on cylinders 1-3-5 then you know there‚Äôs an issue on the right bank and could be fuel rail or wiring to injectors on said bank.",Dodge
"a 6 cylinder will never give the thrill a V8 can. 

It can be great, and be fast. but that rumble of a V8 just sings to a man. Its definitely apart of the experience.",Dodge
Its ironic because cops drive dodge chargers too,Dodge
"I have a 2020, so will look at these around 2035. For now it‚Äôs just ‚Äúooh that‚Äôs shiny‚Äù",Dodge

Admittedly 140k is pretty good for a domestic engine.,Dodge
"You are making Direct Connection sound like it is Renntec, Wald, Lorinser or Carlsson to Mercedes? You can go right on the Dodge site and order stuff. Tons own a Hellcat and its many variations.

"Inline 4s suffer from poor primary and secondary balance due to the way they are structured, unless you add balance shafts, which reduce reliability/increase weight and cost as you are simply adding more moving parts. An inline 6 is essentially the perfect engine from a mechanical balance standpoint, which has a huge number of direct and indirect benefits for the cylinder configuration as a whole.

"Again, you will not gain any noticeable power without mods that will void your warranty. So it is all about what sound you want with a cat back exhaust. Personally, I like the sound of the Flowmaster American Thunder.",Dodge
"I‚Äôm happy Dodge is making it with full of options. EV, 2 or 4 door and ICE engine options. It covers the entire gamut. 

We need this car to succeed so that Dodge builds up enough carbon credits where they don‚Äôt have to purchase them from Tesla anymore. If they do well enough, we may see a small production line of V8 muscle cars again, kinda like what Ford is doing with the Mustang. 

I don‚Äôt think battery is the solve long term, having experienced it myself, I rather have an eFuel carbon neutral solution than wasting my time charging up. It‚Äôs getting actually aggravating to charge up now. Not enough open slots and waiting in line 15 to 30 minutes and charging up another 30 to 60 minutes has gotten old fast. Plus studies indicate that with the rare earth metals, and the human slave factor to obtain this is extremely detrimental and not actually improving the carbon footprint. Let alone we don‚Äôt know where or how these used up batteries are getting recycled. It‚Äôs a hot mess. I rather have cheap eFuel made here, and it takes 90 seconds to fill up. IDK call me logical.",Dodge
Thanks. Looking at the Nittos. I can get all 4 installed for around $1300. Or 2 for $670. Might go with those for now. As long as they‚Äôre an upgrade from the stock I‚Äôll be happy. I don‚Äôt drive it too hard anyway so they should last me. Just once in a while I want to have some fun lol thanks man,Dodge

"Depends on what you want out of your tires. I have  Michelin Pilot Sport 4s on me challenger year round. Before that I had General Gmax RS which were significantly cheaper but still decent tires! If you‚Äôre never in freezing weather I prefer summer tires as they grip better in the dry and wet. Continental Xtreme Contacts are pretty good tires too. Gforce Comp 2 are popular all seasons that I would vouch for.

Personally I stay away from Pirelli and Goodyear tires due to experiences with poor grip in standard driving situations.",Dodge

Introduction:  
Dodge, an iconic name in the realm of American automotive history, has left an indelible mar",Dodge
Six pack will sell great!,Dodge
The satellite connection is in the inside rear view mirror.  I would recommend having a dealer look at it before doing anything invasive.,Dodge
In that case make it 39 HP and 45 lb-ft of more torque for the HO I6.,Dodge
"If it is fast as hell, maybe not. The problem is you will not get that V8 sound.",Dodge
Thank you!!! I never thought I'd head that from someone with a Supercharged SRT Challenger. Really awesome car btw!,Dodge
My 2010 dodge challenger head unit does the same thing after 12 years though,Dodge
The EV actually looks priced significantly higher than the current scat and should be quite a lot faster than the hellcat. The current scat would be more akin to the HO sixpack,Dodge
Do you the system? If so how well do you like it so far?,Dodge
As a Stellantis worker who‚Äôs been fired before and seen how they treat the lowest level workers ‚ÄúFirst time huh?‚Äù Scum all over the big 3,Dodge
I clearly pointed out that the i6 would definitely be more expensive due to higher input costs and manufacturer trends.,Dodge
"NDNUKR

Need new car",Dodge
Then explain all the eco boosts that are still blowing up? I‚Äôve been wrenching my entire life and have watched as engines get smaller the problems increase. Duty cycle is an often overlooked cause of failure in parts. A smaller turbo engine has to work 2-3 times as hard to make the same power as a larger engine. It‚Äôs just a matter of time before something will break.,Dodge
"What vehicle, what engine¬†


Come on man lol",Dodge
Four on the floor hemi is no joke. An AWD pursuit with a mild hp gain like long tubes or a cam can keep up with a scat in the quarter mile simply due to how much better it can put power to the road,Dodge
">The sole reason that the ev won't sell is because it Costs too much damn money.


Pricing hasn‚Äôt even been announced‚Ä¶",Dodge
So you saying the probability is lower compared to the newer ones?,Dodge
Yes. People are going to move towards bmw if they want a inline 6.,Dodge
Have you considered googling year make model mopar carbon fibre shifter?,Dodge
Yeah. I think Dodge actually intended for it to be the replacement for the stratus. It is on the same platform as the Chrysler Sebring/200,Dodge
I want a real carbon fiber one,Dodge
Oof those runs hurt my eyes,Dodge
I have a 5.7 rt charger and I love it and got it over a scat because it was cheaper and apparently more mod friendly. Getting 500-600 whp in a 5.7 is a lot more than you‚Äôd think and by the time you‚Äôre in that range you‚Äôve spent a lot more than you would if you had gotten a scat. You could find a 5.7 w decent mileage for 25k that has a couple of mods done to the car already. Slogarage on YouTube has a couple videos on his that broke down price and the stuff done.,Dodge
"Beautiful color. I love the black 5 spoke Hellcat rims. If I had a narrow body they‚Äôd be one of the first mods I did. If I was you, I‚Äôd debadge, paint calipers red, get 5 spoke hellcat rims, mid muffler delete, and tint the windows.",Dodge
Why go to a 6.4? I would keep the 5.7 platform and build it up. Or just go straight to a 6.2,Dodge
The EVs yes but it does have donut mode.  The ICE engine ones you can do all wheel by default or go into 2 wheel drive.,Dodge
üòÇ,Dodge
It‚Äôs the 1964-1993 logo! Just trying to give it that throwback type of vibe to compliment the neon.,Dodge
So what tires can I get but keep my same rims?,Dodge
Does that model have an in cabin air filter?,Dodge
Would you give a teenager any challenger (SXT/GT specifically) to even begin with?,Dodge
Oh....no is that you Miss Smith .. my 3rd grade English teacher?,Dodge
"Yes we address that in the Complaint. It is hardly a solution to brick it, exactly.",Dodge
You know you gotta tell us if you‚Äôre a cop right?,Dodge
you‚Äôll find one somewhere. i follow someone w a 300 that has a shaker hood,Dodge
"One that has practiced law in the past and has passed the bar exam. 

My work is done here.",Dodge
"Do you have any suggestions for a good place to order one? I saw a couple just googling around online, but wasn‚Äôt sure if anyone had a recommendation based on their experiences.",Dodge
"Couldn‚Äôt agree more. I just traded a charger in for a Durango because of a 3rd child. Charger has plenty of space for up 2 kids and I miss mine a lot. But a charger is not a good option for 3 car seats if you get to that point.  Keep your lower payment and use the extra money for saving for college, diapers, increase in health insurance, more kids  etc.",Dodge
I‚Äôm looking for a grand Cherokee srt right now and you can‚Äôt find anything decent for under 45ish. Market stinks. I am Not willing to pay that right now.,Dodge
I bought a 65‚Äù tv and it did not fit in my challenger,Dodge
Lmao yea I‚Äôve had that happen to me at a dealership. Some times they will put a fake price on there to make you come in. I‚Äôd always call and ask for the price out the door before you go. Unless you‚Äôre close by to the place.,Dodge
I want to see long term reliability.,Dodge
Boosted Unlucky,Dodge
"Seems like you‚Äôll be coming out of this with an SRT of your choosing, friend.",Dodge
Durango hellcat it is,Dodge
Get a second opinion on what‚Äôs wrong,Dodge
"Not at all, I‚Äôm new to cars and was curious.",Dodge
Atleast the wheel chocks for god sakes,Dodge
I like it but I‚Äôm not in a rush to get it. Well get a super chartered hurricane in due time so I‚Äôm going to wait for that BUT and I don‚Äôt want to get political or start anything but Mr. Trump has said if elected he will get rid of all the vehicle stuff pushing for EV‚Äôs so if he does I see the Hemi returning since Dodge is pretty conservative as a company. With that being said I don‚Äôt want to rush into this just for the Hemi to come back in a few years.,Dodge
Charger is 4 dr. Challenger is 2 dr..  4 + engine choices in either body from 6 cyl to topping of with hellcat supercharged 8 cyl  choices.,Dodge
"[Boom](https://imgur.com/a/p4Sy8vk) 

[Boom](https://imgur.com/a/kD9Gqev) 

Excuse the black fenders, I destroyed the back of a Micra.

Also, [my old man's car](https://imgur.com/a/Z6FYz7h)",Dodge
"Here‚Äôs the main issue‚Ä¶ you really don‚Äôt know what method was used for each car you‚Äôll be listing in the lawsuit.

Just give me a tow truck and some false repo paperwork, I can nab just about any car from the Midway airport.",Dodge
I wisht they brought the Magnum back complete with a 6.4,Dodge
You should still get it. But yes these cars do have a certain rep. Expect harassment from police. Also be wary of thieves. I won‚Äôt even go on certain streets or to certain towns because of my experiences with the harassment.,Dodge
"You could also have a vacuum leak between the engine and the break booster. That would also cause an engine stall and send the ECU into limp mode as manifold pressure is monitored. 

If you are not a mechanic take it to a shop and have it looked at ASAP. likely not safe to be on the road with it.",Dodge
If you dont take it I wouldnt mind the details of this car.... I am actively looking for one to buy in this price range,Dodge
EVs are always heavier than their gas counterparts. I've not seen a weight published for the gas only models yet.,Dodge
"First off, it's an I6, not V6, but yes. If you know your mopar history, it's a reference to the carb arrangement on several of the bigger V8s from the B and E body era. The 440 V8 Six Pack is famously used by Dom Toretto's car in Fast and Furious 1",Dodge
What an odd duck this is‚Ä¶. Looks more like a funeral cab or kidnap special‚Ä¶.. Yikes!,Dodge
Talking about Scats. No way they hit $40k at 0%.,Dodge
How much whp do you think just this will make?,Dodge
I wasn't aware that something changed in 2016,Dodge
Golf . Rt is basic and common. The r is years above in interior and faster,Dodge
Then I have excellent insurance and I can finally maybe get 1/4 of what I put into that dang POS neon out.,Dodge
I'm a fan of this,Dodge
"R/T is more modular and for an extra $10-$30k it‚Äôs not worth the 100 more horsepower you‚Äôre hardly gonna use .. then again , depends on your lifestyle .. I got the 5.7 and I can tune it to exactly where I‚Äôd like .. and get close enough HP that I‚Äôm satisfied with saving up to $30k by spending $8-$10k in upgrades if i choose",Dodge
I‚Äôm jealous but one day I‚Äôll have one. Congratulations,Dodge
I found a nice 4ft universal spoiler it‚Äôs kinda gloss for 80 it‚Äôs kinda plain and it hangs low to the trunk I may put on it but I don‚Äôt know how to add a pic to the comments,Dodge
"It‚Äôs gonna burn thru parts faster than a Toyota or Honda if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking. Tires - it‚Äôs heavy and usually driven hard. Brakes - they‚Äôre high performance so will cost more to replace - learn to do them yourself.  

The rest depends on how you drive it. The engine and transmission are strong but maintenance is key.",Dodge
"That plus package which car was that an rt???

Koons called me today and it doesnt seem they can beat dulles but like you said dulles is weird. Dulles called me today and I already told them I was on board but im test driving other cars and the manager got on the phone and it turned to a yelling contest of me repeating myself of if they stick to the deal ill buy. 

https://www.dulleschryslerdodgejeep.com/new/Dodge/2023-Dodge-Charger-2042e8b60a0e081d7acb4edfe023a3fa.htm

This is the car",Dodge
"Completely agree with. My current car is a 12 year old infinti g35 (with 2007 interiors) and I'd love to finally upgrade to something more modern.

But the amount of posts on bad tech/sensor issues with the mk8 is sort of putting me off. I understand warranty would cover most of it, but I'd hate to have a bad experience after the putting alot of cash down.

The RT though seems ot be pretty solid especially with the interiors.less tech so less things to worry about.",Dodge
"[https://www.chargerforumz.com/threads/alarm-randomly-going-off.201016/#post-1939357](https://www.chargerforumz.com/threads/alarm-randomly-going-off.201016/#post-1939357)

I had the same issue with mine. I posted in the linked forum the star case number, have you seen that bulletin yet? At least you can reference that case number with your dealership if that‚Äôs new info for you and can follow it for a resolution. 


Looked like someone also disconnected the intrusion module and that helped. 

I no longer have the charger and remember how awful that was - Would go off at night constantly. Totally forgot until I just saw your post. Sucks it‚Äôs happening to you too!",Dodge
"Even though the noise isn‚Äôt at idle? Still idle the car, spray the wd40, and test drive?",Dodge
"Charger makes you look like a badass, a golf will make you look like a teen.",Dodge
It has a rebuilt title,Dodge
I really like this grand Cherokee L,Dodge
"A more efficient and powerful engine is replacing it. 

Of course the purists won‚Äôt like it. 

But I‚Äôm coming around to the idea.",Dodge
"It is fun. The ho hurricane is a mean engine, stock even. 

I‚Äôm interested to see what the tuners are going to do with it.",Dodge
goo for it thoo that's a steallll,Dodge
"Bugs to be worked out in 1 year , it‚Äôs stellantis maybe in 4-5.",Dodge
Thats the last year full size american V8 car and will hold value if you garage it and cherish it...,Dodge
"I'll be getting the car. My parents are actually going to switch to a different one and not need it in a couple of years, and selling cars in my country has a massive tax to it, so it's not gonna be worth it. I've read online that there's almost no effect on performance.",Dodge
"It only had 245 to begin with lol and that's at the crank.

Figure 20% driveline loss and he's about right about where he should be assuming he's quoting wheel power.",Dodge
Ew those things are ugly,Dodge
on metal,Dodge
the comments üíÄ,Dodge
It absolutely will! The I6 version will not be available till 2025. The EV is the only option till then. Dodge is going to be hurting real bad. That I6 is a ticking time bomb too. Too much boost to hit those numbers.,Dodge
That‚Äôs a clean neon man. Some day I‚Äôm going to rip it up in one of those things,Dodge
"The transmission is the thing you got to look for to fail first.

Unfortunately I doubt you can trade it without being fleeced.",Dodge
Yah those nexen tires aren‚Äôt very good. Slicks already don‚Äôt last at all. Dodge just has a bad track record of factory tires that aren‚Äôt good enough for the vehicles they‚Äôre mounted to.,Dodge
"The Chrysler transfer case is only good to around ~550 crank horsepower before it explodes, ask me how I know lol. Unfortunately, there's not a lot you can do to upgrade your t-case specifically. There is always the AWD system from the Durango Hellcat and Trackhawk, but it's dubious that those systems would fit on a 300 unibody, though if you're a skilled bodyman/fabricator you could try to make it work.

You'd also need a new diff(s). Both front and back because of your AWD, in addition to a new tranny, because those stock diffs are also going to explode if you go from a Pentastar to a Hellcat. Might as well get a new driveshaft at that point too, a V6 one ain't gonna cut it for long.

Is it physically possible to swap a kitty into an AWD V6 300? Yes. Does it require replacing essentially every single moving part on the car? Also yes.",Dodge
"Based off how the Mach E and Model 3 are currently doing, it will depreciate to Model 3 pricing within a year of release if they try to sell them for $60k+",Dodge
"I can test this but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a battery voltage issue. 

I am getting p0642 and a bunch of other codes related to the throttle body, accelerator pedal, crankshaft position sensor, and oil pressure sensor. 

I‚Äôve replaced all but the accelerator pedal and the truck still does the same thing",Dodge
Viper. What was it going for??,Dodge
You‚Äôre correct.,Dodge
Lawyrer!,Dodge
"You‚Äôre comparing a v6 with no turbos on a base model vs a twin turbo 6 cylinder which will cost more than a v8. The only reason those v6s sold is because they‚Äôre cheaper. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs the same with the Mustang and the Camaro. People want a cool looking car for cheap. The new 6 cylinder is not going to be cheaper, so it‚Äôs  not the same comparison. The ones who would buy v6s are going to be priced out and the ones that want v8s are going to be alienated. Nothing that FCA sells at the moment is doing good, and getting rid of the one thing that made them unique isn‚Äôt a smart move.",Dodge
Curious what this has to do with Dodge automobiles‚Ä¶,Dodge
"I mean for the price that a swap like this would cost, if it's even doable you could probably just buy a hellcat. 

Just enjoy your car my bro, the Pentastar is an alright engine that makes good power.",Dodge
No like i dont have a motor anymore the shop blew it up completely,Dodge
"IIRC the 2009-2015 models specifically are more prone to lifter issues than any other model year - the pre-2009 hemi did not have MDS, which correlates with lifter issues, and the 2016 and later featured an updated lifter design with larger rollers in their bearings.

That being said, 09-15 models are not time bombs, and pre-09/post-15 models are not indestructible. You can end up with any engine problems on any car of any year.",Dodge
U12bro? ü§°ü§°,Dodge
What do you want your average person to do? Terrorism? Because Dodge can't sell an engine anymore?,Dodge
A lawyer told me I could have a suit against the dealership and the employee as an individual. I feel like this could get very messy.,Dodge
"Inline 6s that make more power and torque than the 5.7 and 6.4. Or go buy a V8, there are plenty sitting on dealer lots all across the country right this very second.",Dodge
"If you do that, make sure you're running a minimum 20x9 (preferably a 20x9.5 or 20x10). Otherwise, it will make the tires crown, putting less tread touching the ground than the 245.",Dodge
"I have a coworker that recently had his widebody scat pack challenger stolen, if you want I can get some information from him. I also have a push to start 2021 RT charger if that matters",Dodge
"No. 33% of the ‚Äúv8 or kill me‚Äù crowd is boomers, 33% echoing what they hear, and 33% never even owned a Hemi-powered Mopar. Leave the 1% open for interpretation

Edit: I‚Äôve had an SXT, an RT (Shaker), and have access to drive an SRT Charger and I‚Äôll be first inline for the HO Sixpack.",Dodge
"That‚Äôs okay, I like washing my car anyways",Dodge
"I have test driven it a couple of times (though not for very long) and other than a bit of belt squeak when you‚Äôre outside the truck it seems to do just fine. Honestly, the reason I‚Äôm buying a $2,000 truck over a $3,000 truck is because I want money left over for maintenance and gas so I‚Äôd be prepared for maintenance lol.",Dodge
"Depends.

How long will the Hurricanes be in the shop for?",Dodge
Pilot sports are good too. I was looking for those as well but I heard soo much about Nitto and Mickey Thompsons that I'm going with them next,Dodge
"And since they have a screen, it‚Äôs cheaper to put all the controls in there than to make a bunch of physical buttons.",Dodge

"Yeah I was digging also, looks like an '84 but I sent a couple photos to my mother in law (daughter of that old guy) and she said it's not quite exact. She can't remember what year it was. After I can get a solid ID on it I'm going to hunt one down for my wife as an anniversary gift",Dodge
Yep! Luckily mine had less than 15k miles when the screen delaminated so I called Mopar and they agreed to cover it under warranty. Worth a try to call Mopar first. I think it should be a recall issue because Ram drivers have complained about the same thing.,Dodge
"Depends on how driven. If you‚Äôre in boost all the time, they are not more efficient. But in this case, yes. Yes they are.",Dodge
Can you feel it in the floor? Almost sounds like a metal rattle from one of the two cross brace pieces behind the x pipe.,Dodge
"Dodge‚Äôs seat quality is definitely a known issue. I‚Äôve seen several cars with low miles with seats I‚Äôd describe as being in rather poor condition. I think the cloth actually holds up a little better than the alcantara. Maintenance is a definite must and I‚Äôve already bought covers for mine. I had the all leather in my GT, and that did seem to hold up well but you‚Äôre right about the sticky summers/cold winters. I had the cloth in my R/T but felt it looked kinda cheap. Now I have the alcantara in my Scat and really try to be conscious of not sitting on the bolster and sliding into the driver‚Äôs seat. I passed on buying a beautiful F8 2018 SRT 392 with 10,000 miles because the driver‚Äôs seat was so bad and I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts complaining about the same issue. Not sure what the answer is but whichever seat material you have be sure to practice good maintenance or they look ragged rather quickly.",Dodge
My 2016 Mustang GT (coyote v8) had a similar sound in similar RPM range. It happens more frequently when driving uphills.,Dodge
"Yup , still going to be used in wrangler , minivan , ram , grand cherokee. Not everyone wants or needs 400 plus HP turbo engines",Dodge
"The average turbo lifespan is 150,000 to 200,000.
Also you can remote mount them. Google sts remote turbo. It can be anywhere in the exhaust.

Would an AWD GT Challenger be a more responsible option?,Dodge
thx,Dodge
"> I'm sure even the entry hurricane is more expensive to produce than the good ol pushrod Hemi 5.7 considering they've been making millions of them for 20 years

The zero dollar cost difference between the 5.7L V8 and SO I6 in the Wagoneer says that costs to produce the two are probably not that far apart.",Dodge

What‚Äôs your voltage like when it happens. Almost sounds like your truck might not be getting enough power then just stalls,Dodge
I will never buy from someone who can‚Äôt be bothered to properly format his for sale post,Dodge
"Couldn't agree more. I've owned 6 dodges in my lifetime and most of them were fine until 200k+ miles or until i sold them to change/upgrade. Biggest issue on these is electrical or transmission so if it starts and drives fine, you should be good.",Dodge
I‚Äôm from New York so I have to ask where in the USA you‚Äôre at because that looks awesome,Dodge
Good tires will fix  that issue,Dodge
Go to wheelcentercaps.com,Dodge
I mean the black one you posted is a scat. The other you just sent me is a Daytona. You‚Äôd have to look at the engine or ask them about the Daytona to know if it‚Äôs a 6.4L engine or the 5.7,Dodge

- uConnect delamination; near where the ‚ÄúFM‚Äù button is on the touch screen and bottom left hand corner is beginning to pull away. My mom‚Äôs Jeep Renegade had the same issue but her‚Äôs was so bad it‚Äôd make phantom 911 phone calls and the radio was inoperable.

As for recalls, Cummins is pretty good at keeping an open channel with dealers and they‚Äôre quick to get recalls taken care of.

Brake pad shims help prevent brake noise or NVH. They do this by creating a barrier between the brake pad and caliper. This prevents vibration from being transmitted into the rest of the vehicle and the ear of the driver.,Dodge

"Charger here. After driving both Scat and R/T I came home with the R/T. Stock for stock the performance difference between the two cars is not as much as the numbers make it appear. With equally skilled drivers you're looking at about half a second 0-60. To get that you're going to have to spend about $10,000 more up front and be penalized by higher insurance costs, worse fuel mileage, having to use premium gas, stupidly expensive brake jobs with the Brembos and have your ride be a bigger target for thieves. All that additional cost wasn't worth it for me.",Dodge

"Of course.  All these problems are mostly ..relatively simple fixes.   Another thing with my charger is the suspension was completely shot by 170k.   Overall, dude, I beat the absolute piss out of my charger all 200k miles.   The fact that those were all my issues I had over that span of 8 years, not bad.  Not bad at all.  Mostly because I did all the repairs myself.    I thought I blew the motor at 200k so I pulled it and bought a new one.  

Find out that the timing chain tensioner broke and the motor was fine... now I have a back up motor lol.  Currently installing twin turbos on the lower mileage motor.",Dodge
Incentives aren‚Äôt justifying this yet. Eventually they‚Äôre going to start incentivizing them more heavily.,Dodge
Thank you the advice is appreciated. Is there anything real specific i should look for when looking over the car?,Dodge
Chito ?,Dodge
 They'll do anything to keep the trademark.,Dodge
I immediately slowed down to 45 sitting in my chair,Dodge
PAU is code for granite,Dodge
Reports state there may be a 3.6 pentastar option with it staying around in the trucks.,Dodge

High chance it‚Äôs a V6,Dodge
...especially next to a Neon it looks bad! :),Dodge
"O shit u rite.

Edit: if it makes you feel any better I washed them after you pointed that out. Much better now",Dodge
It is? Never even thought to check.,Dodge
It sounds like every other turbo straight six on the market. Hello BMW.,Dodge
This is a 1996 ram 1500 with the 5.9 btw,Dodge
Fuck yes.,Dodge
Have to wait till they release the Srt Banshee model.,Dodge
Sick!,Dodge
My lady is definitely proud. Thank you for noticing ;),Dodge
I think it'll be a race to see who does the first Hemi swap,Dodge
Daytona 392 was my dream car. Obviously hellcats and a bunch of other cars are better but I wouldn‚Äôt daily them. IMO I have the best car that I would also daily and it was worth the money. RT didn‚Äôt feel anywhere near as peppy to me,Dodge
Exquisite.,Dodge
This reminds me of a Married with Children episode,Dodge
If they're just suggesting lifters than that's a good sign. You caught it before the camshaft got ate up,Dodge
I heard that one tap you are talking about. Idk what that is or if mine does is but that ticking you are hearing sounds like every other 5.7 hemi. My 2020 sounded like that and my 23 does that sound as well.  Idk what that tap was though.  The hemi is a loud engine and has noisy lifters. So that ticking is 100% normal.,Dodge
"A 392 is just a 5.7 that's built and bored, it should be a relatively painless process",Dodge
It's inevitable,Dodge
"The EV is 6000 pounds not the ICE version. I swear yall can‚Äôt read.

Keep the Hellcat, people buying the new vehicle dont want it anyway.",Dodge
I concur,Dodge
2nd picture is the ambient air temp sensor. Goes in the front bumper area,Dodge
Even the WK1 jeep srt doesn't come with one at all lol I still want a 6.1 hemi in a charger or jeep I already got challenger 392 widebody. The lsd improves your 0-60 times,Dodge
Best EV I've ever seen. Hope it's fun to drive and reasonably priced. We'll see how it's reviewed,Dodge
Some of those people were my coworkers. I‚Äôm uaw and now this place will feel even more grim. It‚Äôs a shame what‚Äôs happening to this company.,Dodge
I doubt there will be anything dodge will do for you for an incident that occurred with a 23 year old vehicle. My bet would be a power steering or a transmission hose blew and got oil on the exhaust. Seen that happen with a similar year liberty.,Dodge
i heard this is common w 2017 models. is that the year of yours?,Dodge
Check fuses too,Dodge
The 3.0 is already in production and has been equipped in the wagoneer for at least 2 years now. Stellantis also has been testing the H/O in the trx replacement as well. They‚Äôre decent with engines. Just everything else is a problem child,Dodge
üî•,Dodge
I have a Scat Charger and my daughter an RT Challenger. My charger is hands down more fun to drive in every way. I‚Äôd go Scat because you‚Äôll want more power soon.,Dodge
"They are.  The ""sewing machine"" sound is the injectors.",Dodge
"Oh yea?  Even if I don't know shit about something and someone asks me if it's possibly one particular thing, I'm going to figure it out myself.  I know these have this common failure that causes a noise like that.

What a dick thing to say lol",Dodge
It's an intrepid. No. Run,Dodge
"Gonna be an unpopular opinion here, but the MK8 R by far. I have an S7, so I am familiar with how amazing a V8 note is, but the golf r will be so much cheaper to build power with and is probably faster stock.  My cousins Mk7 R is so much more well put together and nicer inside than my dad's previous Durango R/T and the charger GT loaner I was stuck with for 4 months this summer. Turbo noises are cool too (if you decide to get an intake). you'll have better traction in snow (assuming equal tires). It'd also be much better on gas, and I imagine insurance would probably be equal or slightly in favour of the golf.",Dodge
"I think it looks great. The outgoing model looked great and this new design is a evolution that also harks back to the 68 Charger. The hurricane six has been out for a little while now in the Wagoneers so those owners would be able to give some insight on initial reliability. The hurricane is more complicated than the hemi but the Hemi wasn't Chevy 350 reliable either what with it's camshaft and lifter problems and manifold issues. 

The electric models? Well they'll be fast as hell and I guess that bothers some people. Dodge needed a better CAFE score so they won't be spending millions on credits.",Dodge
Sure buy one. They're fun comfortable cars and prices are falling.,Dodge
"Two things:

1: tires tires tires
2: open diff? If so you're gonna break traction a lot so the car is using the brake to keep the wheel from spinning",Dodge
Let me know. I think it's a 8mm. I'm curious to see what your motor looks like,Dodge
I loved my dart and it did me good,Dodge
"The MPG is mainly for Stellantis.

>Also about 30 more HP and 60 more lb-ft of torque.¬†


That‚Äôs for the owner.",Dodge
"Yeah‚Ä¶ but not in trucks.  I would love if they had made a turbo hemi option.   A sport truck even?   

Hopefully they do well with the inline 6.  Just feel like they moved away from their best selling motors way too quickly.",Dodge
I believe those came with a 5yr/60k mile warranty so I would say you are shit out of luck.,Dodge
I think exterior of the challenger is nicer  but the interior of the new charger will be 100 times better. As for powertrain I‚Äôm sure the 6 turbo will be pretty stout but it‚Äôs not gonna have that growl of the Hemi.  That I will miss the most.,Dodge
" Sounds like it went into a limp mode, I would definitely pull codes using an OBD2 reader or you can go to autozone or any parts store and they can do it for free for you. If you wanna buy your own I recommend the one made by BlueDriver.",Dodge
The new Hemi is already out. It's the straight six Hurricane.,Dodge
"No complaints on the '15 dart I have, just hit 100k. 2.4L has good power, If it is the 2.0 it will feel a little weak.",Dodge
If you have $37k on hand there‚Äôs a guy on Facebook that hasn‚Äôt been able to sell his swapped HC 300.,Dodge
Imagine if that lifter thing fails and that gazillion ton truck (tank) falls on the Dodge,Dodge
"Haven‚Äôt made time to do it yet. I was going to drop the blower motor, clean it out and then try a product called AC PRO flush system cleaner to see if it helps.",Dodge
Umadbro,Dodge
"17 years ago the term  ""Hemi tick"" simply meant the way the engine sounded.  In the years since, idiots, who probably never owned one, parrot and shriek ""Hemi tick!"" to suggest the engine is about to blow up.  It's fine, if you take care of it, it will sound the same in 2034.",Dodge
"Your problem was parking an SRT in a lot in Chicago, where the police, quite publicly, have stated they *do not care* about doing their jobs. Chicago PD is a terrible LE organization - I say this as an individual who works with various federal (FBI/DHS etc) and state organizations often due to my work. They are *useless*.

Edit: any heavily liberal city has the same issue with their LE organizations. They feel attacked for getting asked to do their jobs in a manner that might be considered ethical.  You want to start a class action? Sue the useless LE organizations who feel they shouldn‚Äôt be held to practical standards.",Dodge
Order the parts from the Direct Connection website. Have them shipped to your house then go to the dealer for installation. The dealer near me was cool with it.,Dodge
I doubt she can apply what you did considering it‚Äôs a used 150k journey,Dodge
"Don't forget the locking differential and improved suspension.  Add the Dynamics package, which gives you 6 piston Brembo brakes and wider tires (275's), and you get one great car.  Maintenance costs are higher, but there's always a price to pay.....",Dodge
Hemi motors recommend 91 octane already.,Dodge
That's where I got mine ground effects and wheels,Dodge
Some poor RamCharger gave up its life for this.,Dodge
" Had this happen to my charger.  I replaced a wheel speed sensor and it solved the issue. I bet thats the problem.

I have the Michelin Pilot Sport AS4 on mine. They are awesome! They work very well in all seasons including ice and snow. I LOVE them!,Dodge
üò≠üò≠off topic but $25k for 127k is a fkn scam,Dodge
"Wait till the radio starts changing stations, etc on it's own. Chrysler knows it's a problem, but they don't care.",Dodge
"It also has the stigma that people tend to gtfo the way when cruising, especially the highway.",Dodge
"Yes I'm aware, see my flair. The Hurricane variants aren't replacing the Hellcat, they're replacing the 5.7L and 6.4L.",Dodge
"Those are wheel center caps. If you Google ""year make model center caps"" that should get you there.",Dodge
"No , if you want a good small car buy a civic , or Corolla not a dodge. It will cost you down the road. Dodge makes good full size cars but their small cars are garbage",Dodge
The S.O. gets 2 MPG better with FAR lower smog ratings. People keep forgetting that MPG isn't the only factor. The hemi engines had horrible smog ratings. The EPA scores every engine based on MPG and smog. The H.O. gets worse MPG but also offers an 80HP boost and over 100 lb ft of torque more than the outgoing 5.7.,Dodge
Did u fan out of the police academy or something,Dodge
Cool üòé,Dodge
The rear glass looks to be from a Ramcharger. Like someone was trying to mix the van-conversion amenities with the towing capabilities of the Ram 350 dually.,Dodge
Actually magnum was canceled so challenger could be made. The Brampton plant didn‚Äôt have the capacity to make the challenger along with the other 3 cars so unfortunately one had to go and it‚Äôs usually the one that sells the least that gets the axe,Dodge

"Introduction:  
Dodge, an iconic name in the realm of American automotive history, has left an indelible mark on the roads and in the hearts of car enthusiasts worldwide. From its humble beginnings to its evolution into a powerhouse brand, Dodge has consistently epitomized innovation, performance, and style. This essay embarks on a journey through the storied legacy of Dodge, exploring its milestones, iconic models, and enduring impact on the automotive industry.  
  
Origins and Early Years:  
The Dodge brothers, John and Horace, laid the foundation for what would become one of the most recognizable automobile brands in the world. In 1900, they established the Dodge Brothers Company to supply parts and assemblies for Detroit's burgeoning automotive industry. By 1914, they had ventured into car manufacturing, producing their first vehicle, the Dodge Model 30. This sedan boasted advanced features for its time, setting a precedent for Dodge's commitment to innovation and quality.  
  
Innovation and Evolution:  
Throughout the decades, Dodge continued to push the boundaries of automotive engineering. In the 1960s, Dodge introduced the iconic Charger, a sleek and powerful muscle car that captured the imagination of a generation. Its aggressive styling and formidable performance made it an instant classic, cementing Dodge's reputation as a purveyor of high-performance vehicles.  
  
The 1970s saw the birth of another legend, the Dodge Challenger. With its muscular design and potent engines, the Challenger became synonymous with American muscle cars, inspiring awe and admiration on the streets and racetracks alike. Despite economic challenges and shifting consumer preferences, Dodge persevered, adapting to changing times while staying true to its heritage of performance and craftsmanship.  
  
Revival and Reinvention:  
In the late 20th century, Dodge underwent a revitalization, embracing modern design trends and technological advancements. The Viper, introduced in 1992, epitomized this new era of Dodge innovation. With its sleek aerodynamics and blistering performance, the Viper redefined the supercar segment, showcasing Dodge's ability to blend raw power with contemporary sophistication.  
  
In the 21st century, Dodge continued to innovate with a focus on performance-oriented vehicles. The Challenger and Charger received modern updates, combining retro styling cues with cutting-edge technology and potent powertrains. Meanwhile, Dodge ventured into new territory with the introduction of the Durango SUV and the Journey crossover, expanding its lineup to cater to a diverse range of consumers.  
  
Legacy and Impact:  
Dodge's legacy extends far beyond its lineup of iconic vehicles. It represents a testament to American ingenuity, resilience, and the pursuit of excellence. From the racetrack to the everyday commute, Dodge cars evoke a sense of excitement and passion, forging a deep connection with drivers around the world.  
  
Moreover, Dodge has left an indelible mark on popular culture, appearing in films, television shows, and music videos as a symbol of power, freedom, and rebellion. Its iconic logo, featuring the ram's head, has become synonymous with strength and durability, further solidifying Dodge's status as an automotive icon.  
  
Conclusion:  
In conclusion, Dodge stands as a shining example of American automotive excellence. From its humble beginnings to its status as a global powerhouse, Dodge has captivated generations of enthusiasts with its innovative designs, potent performance, and unwavering commitment to quality. As we look to the future, one thing remains certain: the legacy of Dodge will continue to inspire and endure for years to come.",Dodge
Replicate version of OEM factory wheels usually just a standard cast instead of forged which makes them a cheaper alternative for people looking for that look instead of performance as replicas can be heavier and not as durable as OEM.,Dodge
It got delaminated. Luckily mine was under warranty when it started to go out. You will need a new unit unfortunately and have it reset at the dealer or mopar certified location. It costs $1100 without warranty :(,Dodge
I wonder what the hundreds of people I see doing engine swaps with the RWD model did,Dodge
Personally I will never own a turbo again and I owned one of the best most refined ones availible at the time and the turbo-lag was awful and terrifying turning left at intersections...only naturally aspirated engines for me,Dodge
"My first car was a 2010 Avenger, 4cyl. Slow af but I loved it regardless, my coworker had the V6 and what a difference lol. They're all cool vehicles, enjoy it my dude!",Dodge
Registration looking a little expired,Dodge
2009  HEMIS and up have VVT ( variable valve timing) . The 5.7 in the L cars from 2005-2008 don‚Äôt,Dodge
i mean angles,Dodge
Crystal Granite Metallic,Dodge
"7000 k on a 87 are you insane. Use the money to buy a newer used one
Your throwing your money into the garbage",Dodge
"You didn't mention what year 300, but if it's non-vvt, it probably won't work without a LOT of money.  Why don't you just look for a Chrysler 300 AWD with 5.7, bolt a supercharger on it and call it a day?",Dodge
"Depends on where you live, where you frequent, etc.

I'm not aware of any reliability issues for 2018 but 2015-2017 had some bearing issues on the supercharger that would prematurely fail.

If you're scared you can invest money into high or low end security measures. High end would be IGLA, Compustar Pro T13, Drone. Low end would be Tazer, basic kill switch, unplugging fuel pump from trunk, etc.

I love everything about my Hellcat and how obnoxious it is. Everywhere on the car is plastered with SRT or Hellcat and you're always reminded you're in one. It's a fun experience and very daily drivable.",Dodge
Correct.,Dodge
"Thats not a V8. Demand for naturally aspirated V8s is still high. We should see a new one, sitting at about 500hp, in a few years.",Dodge
When the motor blows do an srt-4 swap,Dodge
"Absolutely not. I love Dodge, but their compact cars are not it. Especially the Dart. 

Shitty engineering, poor sales, discontinued parts. 

unless it has 8k miles on it and has been sitting in a garage for its whole life, don‚Äôt touch it with a ten foot pole. 

There‚Äôs so many better economy car options that will be not only more reliable, but also easier on your wallet. 

Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, just about anything Mazda, etc.",Dodge
"personally i‚Äôd go for a loaded R‚ÄôT so i can leave budget room for bigger and nicer rims and tires a wrap a nice exhaust theft protection performance mods, essentially built vs bought i‚Äôd rather have a rt with everything i want a little less power then a scatpack and you have the option of adding boost which can get you a good bit faster then a scat pack",Dodge
Cancer AND REPRODUCTIVE HARM?  I‚Äôm assuming Tom Douchery is the reason,Dodge
I had to reread it at first cause I did tooüòÇ,Dodge
"This is halfway correct, the manual R/Ts come with a 3.09 LSD and uses premium just like a scat",Dodge
"It sounds pretty typical, honestly. I hear lots of clicking, but it doesn't sound like the ""bad clicks"". Stock exhaust doesn't make a great sound.",Dodge
"Yes. Buy the aluminum one. I did.   My recommendations:

-change oil with high quality full synthetic oil regularly(I'm sure you know this) and regularly check oil levels.

-check coolant and transmission fluid levels

-never let it overheat and your heads gaskets will last a long time

-replace the rocker arms with the Dorman ones, make sure to torque to spec properly, using the correct method (rotating crank as you torque) if you have never done this before, it's not very difficult even for a beginner.  As long as you have youtube, a torque wrench and some motivation it should be relatively simple.

-replace the valve cover gaskets and intake manifold gaskets when you do the oil cooler.  

-Change timing chain before the tensioner breaks lol what a mess that was.",Dodge
"It's a big  car with most of the weight on the nose where the motor is. Couple this with a torquey V-8 and an open diff, and this is totally normal. You have to watch it with the right foot when it's wet.

I have a Scat, and even with the posi ass end, she'll squirm around in the wet while I am just driving normal. 

Everybody says the stock 245's suck but in reality, they are fine as long as you are using your head. I think a 275 upgrade is worth the effort if you have 9"" wheels, but not before you get you $$$ worth out of the stock tires first.

Just take it easy in the rain.. That traction control light on the dash is telling you what is up.",Dodge
471btch,Dodge
If it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fuc with it!,Dodge
"Vics are popular because the 4.6 modular is indestructible, the cars are cheap/plentiful and they're one of the last big comfy RWD American sedans, not because people want to cosplay LEOs. It's not rocket science",Dodge
I'm just wondering how many hours (maybe minutes) after release we'll see a Hemi swap. I'm assuming they'll still be selling Hemi crate engines and the used market is vast.,Dodge
What are reps?,Dodge
"Turbos are always more efficient. I firmly believe everything should come with a turbocharger.

Edit: for all the people down voting go Google it",Dodge
"Yeah, I remember when they came back out with the ""hemi"" and thought it was so cool until I found out they just took the name. But I get it. Gotta keep up with the times. I just dont like change. Haha.",Dodge
"Cost and complexity is always a concern. That's why naturally aspirated V8s continue to be so popular.

These aren't exotics for 0.1% buyers, they're everyday cars for everyday people.",Dodge
"I bought a new 23 charger scat with the plus pack in b5 color . Sticker for 56,080 . The took 3500 off. It‚Äôs a slim body. I love it. Bought it in Fort Worth.",Dodge
"There's a couple of v6 variants too, but who's counting.",Dodge
that inline 6 IS way meaner and JUST wait till they turn up the wick..,Dodge
that‚Äôs annoying. esp when i hear good reviews about uconnect,Dodge
"You need to start aggressively saving money for a new car. Check out ‚Äúfinancial audit‚Äù on YouTube for tips as a single mom, other single moms have been on the show.

I would drive the dodge journey until it completely dies on you. I would also invest in AAA in case it does break down on you.",Dodge
Good race,Dodge
"It a pretty good deal considering the fact that every place around me tries to sell you a used 22/23 scat with a few thousand miles for more than 53,000k",Dodge
"Making me wanna fit a remote control device on my ‚Äò95 dodge Neon then take it to the dealership to diagnose some noises while driving and purposely crash it via remote control then blame it on themü§£

/s",Dodge
Sounds like Durango Hellcat it is then.,Dodge
Your welcome lol üëç,Dodge
I've seen new ones go as low as 35k... and you typically get better interest rates buying new.,Dodge
"Over 127,000 on the odometer, but inside & out - still looking good üî• tires, batteries, etc. so far, nothing big",Dodge
Depends on what trim you want. A R/T for 40k is possible now. Wouldn't surprise me if we see Scats for 40k with 0% interest before end of the year.,Dodge
"it checks out, it's a certified motard moment for sure",Dodge
The performance of the hurricane 550 is bananas. It‚Äôs a super smooth engine and amazing feel and responsiveness. It‚Äôs an engine I think people will come to really love. I have about 18k miles on mine now. It is an exceptional engine,Dodge
"Headers/exhaust and a 91 octane tune will get you a little power bump. More than that I'd put some 10"" wheels out back and a nice sticky set of 305s. More power is useless if you can't get it to the ground.",Dodge
"Absolutely not. No magic 8 ball.

Just being on top of preventative maintenance and overall taking better care of it will make it last long time.

If these were Toyotas I would easily say 500k miles",Dodge
We negotiated 16k,Dodge
I know the Hurricane six is an expansion of the global four cylinder used by Fiat and Alfa. Italians aren't known for making reliable engines.,Dodge
"Yeah it was pretty scary, the car is grounded until I replace it, which I've been meaning to anyway.",Dodge
Def gonna be a dealer that‚Äôs gonna be better. Might just have to drive further to get it done. Hate places like that. Sorry to hear Man. Def not worth your business.,Dodge
Just to note - the srt4 had pops from the factory. Way back in 03-05. Hopefully this isn‚Äôt one of those annoying pop tunes.,Dodge
Pretty much lol,Dodge
"So then back to wanting to look like a cop? Hey it‚Äôs cool, to each their own. I was just always curious to the why. Why bring the attention to yourself from LEO‚Äôs etc. always peaked my curiosity.",Dodge
What do you mean add a hemi?,Dodge
"Very true. The V6's were the real money makers cause they're cheap, they fund the V8's",Dodge
You could just get a rt for cheaper. Which one though the black one? Or the destroyer grey you posted which one says that? When you go look at it look at the engine too it should say 6.4 on the engine. The rts though are pretty good. I reached 0-60 in 5.1 seconds was my best run. The scat is like 4.5 seconds 0-60. So the regular rts does work too man,Dodge
Guaranteed they are collecting all that data and when you go in for warranty work it will snitch on whether you've been doing oil changes on time and how hard you've been driving it.,Dodge
"I‚Äôm just curious about the costs of these things. You could get a lower V8 for a reasonable price. 

Not convinced an inline-6 at 420hp will be as cost effective as the RT.",Dodge
Had a 2012 sxt awd. Was it a great car? No. Did it fit the bill for day to day transportation? Yes. The only issue I had that broke my back about keeping it was the heater core kept plugging. I can tell you how many times I flushed it to keep it going. I finally had enough and traded it. Still ran and drove just fine. Not going to say it didn‚Äôt take some normal repairs in its 140k mile life but I kind of expected it. Just be realistic about keeping it going if you expect to keep it a while.,Dodge
Yea idk you find out let me know because I have a squeaky rt charger also but I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs just what comes with an sports car idk if you find out let me know,Dodge
"You are such a child. When you get an attorney you go after that dealership for everything. The car, the loan, a new car and the fees for the attorney. The owner will most likely settle for about 150k or more because of the fees they don‚Äôt want this going to court in a judges hands.",Dodge
"Sue them. Get in contact with your insurance and a lawyer and go after them for totally your vehicle. There is definitely going to be a police report following the crash and if the driver that totaled was charged with distracted driving it should be a slam dunk case. 

Most importantly make sure you have all of your contract, either in person or over the phone, in writing.",Dodge
Yet it's still a more powerful engine,Dodge
Your lady friends must be proud üòâ,Dodge
Electric is the future demise of the U.S. auto industry,Dodge
Yeah the ‚Äúrt ticking‚Äù that was something I‚Äôve known about but thank you for the info I didn‚Äôt know what year the ticking ended,Dodge
Dang nice srt4 but what‚Äôs with the ugly metallic dorito on top ???,Dodge
stripes would be nice,Dodge
"I‚Äôve down good wit a rebuild 2018 Challenger RT M6 with 9,900 miles 8 months and 22k so far so much fun with Zero issues picky people will notice the slight fender gap",Dodge
Very cool!!,Dodge
"It‚Äôs a 50/50 shot the original key will program to the vehicle again. You will need a licensed scan tool, call a lock smith, or go to the dealership.",Dodge
Good mix.,Dodge
It looks Awesome. Refreshing and a tad over the Top. But I like it üëçüèΩ,Dodge
Most thorough answer thus far. Thank you! I've only had it for 2.5 weeks and started sweating a bit...,Dodge
What type of code would I have to write in to do it if you know just curious?,Dodge
Maybe change the battery,Dodge
1k a month that is insane don't do it. You already have a four door car. Wait to till you have a couple more kids. Save that 500 a month a put that towards a new Durango that will you will by 5 years from now.,Dodge
Just shut up buddy,Dodge
"Technology and the world are gonna move forward, bud. 

Dudes said the same shit about horse drawn carriages and telegraphs that you're saying now.",Dodge
"[The ~~next gen~~ facelift 1500 does not have an available V8 at all](https://www.caranddriver.com/ram/1500), even in the RHO that replaces the TRX. Can't speak on the heavy duty trucks.",Dodge
I would not. Charger has a lot of room and the amount of money they want for Durangos is insane.,Dodge
"Every mod you've listed is relatively non-invasive and are popular/well documented for both the 5.7 and 6.4 hemi. One word of caution with intakes is that the OEM one flows more than enough than what you could ever need NA, and there's a lot of snakeoil intakes that have complete bullshit claims in terms of power. Realistically the best improvement you'll see from an intake is a nicer/louder noise.

Best bang for your buck on these engines is long tube headers, the stock shorties/manifolds don't breathe very well and you can pick up 20-40hp from good long tubes and a tune alone. A cam is a great next step, and the long tubes will make your cam hp gains even bigger. An additional 40-60hp from a cam is a realistic expectation depending on how aggressive your cam/tune is, plus the presence or lack thereof of long tubes.  In terms of tuning/aftermarket support, everyone and their mother mods these engines, so any reputable tuning shop should have lots of experience.

Reliability, even when modded, is fairly good as long as you take care of the car. Change all your fluids on time (not just oil). The later hemis are much less prone to lifter tick due to updated, larger bearings on the lifters themselves, so with a 2019 you should be fine there. A mean cam and phaser lock/MDS delete is going to seriously hurt your MPG, fair warning. You're going to sound badass and make awesome power, but suck down fuel like a HD truck depending on your cam grind.

The only real issue with modding these cars comes with forced induction. Neither the 5.7 nor 6.4 was designed with boost in mind. The 6.4 especially does not like boost, anything more than like 5-7 psi is rolling the dice on a stock rotating assembly. It can be done, but generally if you want to run serious boost you need to get aftermarket internals to handle it. The scats have forged cranks and conrods IIRC but not pistons, so at minimum you'd want pistons designed for boost if you want to do forced air",Dodge

"Newer? This isn't about just getting around, if I wanted a cheap vehicle just to get to places I'd buy a prius, the 87 is one of the best years for the dodge ram van, and I love mine.  

I am really bummed about the engine going out as it was supposed to be the one solid part on the van, and I wanted it to last for a few years so I could upgrade to something I can drag race with (I want to convert mine to a Dajiban someday and take it out to some salt flats) but The 87' B250 is my 67 shelby GT. It's my dream vehicle.

80's dodge vans are work horses, when they work they work long beyond when others can't even turn over. That's why they were used for police, ambulance, hauling and fire vehicles. 

Yeah, this one was left to founder for years and was mistreated by it's last owners, but it's the sort of vehicle that won't quit. 

It's been running for me on a dead alternator, with the vacuum hose nearly disconnected, 2 shorts, a virtually hotwired battery from the last owner, worn down bearings, a bum piston, and with almost half the fuel pressure it should, but I'll be damned if it wasn't still running. It manages to get up and go on pure hopes and dreams some days, and I respect the hell out of it for that. 

Also, it's the only vehicle I've ever had fun driving in. I thought I would be intimidated, I was used to tiny cars and the trucks I'd driven stressed me out. But I love driving it, it's big beefy rumbling engine, the feather light steering, the great visibility. It's a joy to be in, and it's fun to work on. It's a great year to learn mechanics on aside from the lack of instruction online. And I can customize every single aspect of it, and it has more than enough room to modify. 

There are a lot of things I can't do yet, but it's been a blast to learn how to fix new things, and how it works. 

I got this van to learn mechanics and fix it up, I never expected it to be simple. I also use it though, so some things I'd rather have the mechanic do right the first time. Like the brake system and engine issues. 

I love this van, if it costs me more than a new one over time then so be it. I'm never selling it or buying another vehicle so the value doesn't matter, but I want to do things right because what I do with it today I have to pay for later if I half ass it.",Dodge

Until just this year the mustang had less HP than a 392 with the dark horse only having 15 more.  While I'd agree that the 5.7 deserved some refreshing in the last ~15 years the 392 has been a decent/competitive motor for a pushrod engine.  Maybe I'm just biased.

"i personally coulda got a 2017 rt but i ended up getting the 2010 charger SRT i went down on the yearss cuz i truly wasn't happy with the RT i had the 2008 chrysler 5.7 nd it's the same as EVERY 5.7 charger challenger nd to me i didn't like that big plastic cover covering the engine, i kno u cud take it off and all but the engine didn't catch my attention NOW the 6.1 hemi i love the engine look and it's more of a solid mean look to it. as far as the PULLS from a 5.7 to a 6.1 bigg difference 5.7 have a nice pull but after a while u don't get the fun of it no more nd get used to it but for the 6.1 it pulls harder then the RT nd the Sound of the 6.1 sounds wayy better even wen it goes in another gear it keeps on pulling hard... i've race all type of 5.7 new or old nd i always beat them yeahh we might start off the same but that 2nd nd 3rd gear it literally pulls away from them like i said own both so i'm not lieing ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è i'll still prefer the 6.1 engine mean looks over the 6.4 cuz of it plastic look",Dodge
2013 charger rt,Dodge
"It's got a cop motor, it's got cop tires, cop suspensions, cop shocks. What do you say, is it the new Bluesmobile or what?",Dodge
"This is really it. 

Idk the exact number and don‚Äôt care enough to look it up but it feels like 8/10 chargers and challengers you see on the road are the v6s.  

And honestly the way people talk about v8s cracks me up.  I‚Äôm saying this as someone who loves them, I would absolutely keep them around if it was up to me, but there‚Äôs also been plenty of japanese/european i6 cars over the years that have also sounded/performed great.  Multiple things are allowed to be cool. I‚Äôd be willing to bet that if you put most of those guys behind wheel of a well built twin turbo i6 they‚Äôd love it.",Dodge
"Sorry, I like the v8 - i6 with add-ons to compete does nothing for me",Dodge
"I almost took a job hauling cars (not quite like this but similar...)

Money wasnt good enough for everything I was expected to pay for. Hope youre doing well!",Dodge
An independent shop will have to do the same. They'll have to tear it down to point of failure so they can properly diagnose the vehicle. Unless they just guess at it and sell you unnecessary jobs.,Dodge
That‚Äôs true ü§ùüèæ,Dodge
"Oh there's *absolutely* people that go out of their way to look like a cop. Why do you think retired Crown Vics are so popular?

At the very least, it's been done for the cannonball run several times",Dodge

Just get the Charger Six Pack. It‚Äôs the ICE version of the new model.,Dodge
That's crazy being on a Mopar sub being weird about people who like the V8 over the V6 don't ya think?,Dodge
"Nothing yet until it‚Äôs here this summer.

Only concern is the cost. Will it be competitive to model 3 pricing? Or will it be out if reach $60k+",Dodge

OF COURSE YOU SHOULD

üî•üî•üî•,Dodge
The manuals had a lot less issues still get it checked out May want to get the seals and synchros swapped if it's within your budget. If not there's still a YouTube video or two lying around on how to change them out yourself and there is a rebuild kit,Dodge
You can push 285s as well. I did when I had one. It wasn‚Äôt pretty but it worked,Dodge
This is why I‚Äôll never buy a used scat pack ü§£ü§£,Dodge

Are there talks about a supercharger for the Hurricane? Or do you mean wait for the aftermarket and replace the twin turbo,Dodge
"  I have a ""78, the bulb I use there is a 1004 or 105.  Either one fits.",Dodge
Thanks man! I really appreciate it that üôèüèΩ honestly it all happened so fast I couldn‚Äôt have second thoughts I‚Äôve always loved the charger and been a sucker for v8s a so figured I‚Äôd start my dodge journey with a fresh one and after driving the rt it felt perfect,Dodge
"You really need to reconnect that, electricity needs to flow",Dodge
"If you got Ravelco, the only other thing I'd install is a neutral safety switch cover plate.",Dodge
Lol it does. Planning to get it tuned this year hoping for close to 400 wheel.,Dodge
No I don‚Äôt think so. I can definitely check tomorrow when I head to the store. I didnt honestly think to see if I can feel the vibrating.  But I haven‚Äôt noticed any.,Dodge
Yeah no. My first car right now is a 2018 challenger sxt. But a dart no unfortunately unless it is in good condition.,Dodge
Take the front bumper off,Dodge
I wouldn‚Äôt touch it,Dodge
Your in the money! 20x10.5 are great on the rearthe 9.5 on the front can be a bit.,Dodge
I chose the RT because the insurance is cheaper  the monthly cost is cheaper and it‚Äôs less likely to get stolen. I also wanted to mod it which is also cheaper I have 3.09 gears long-tube headers 93 octane tune and transmission tune. I‚Äôll be doing a stage 2 cam this summer I‚Äôm already at 416 horsepower to the crank and 453 ft of torque. I‚Äôm sure it makes more power but my timing was off during the dyno because I was a dumbass and filled up with 89 prior to taking it to the shop,Dodge
That‚Äôs what I have the nappa/alcantara in my Daytona. The vented seat is friggin amazing,Dodge
really? take charger every day of the week,Dodge
"I want a hellcat or scat pack or even an RT.

But I can't afford it! I make barely $50k a year and somehow managed to scrap together enough to buy an SXT challenger back in 2016 for $40K in Canada when I was making less $$.

Now I have to decide if I want to buy this new charger with the hurricane engine or buy an RT when my current sxt bites the dust.

I couldn't bring myself to buy an EV.",Dodge
"I think you underestimate the lobbying power of China. We have allowed China to dominate the resources needed for EV batteries. They will be lobbying for EV sales. Both sides are corrupt when it comes to lobbying. Also, it's not just US politics that affects this.  Nations around the world are moving towards EV only. If the rest of the world does it, companies will adjust and pivot to full EV. Unless synthetic fuel takes off (I sure hope it does), we are heading towards EV mandates. We won't see them in the US for at least 15 years, but it'll be coming. Our infrastructure needs a massive overhaul to ever allow for mass EV usage... but our infrastructure needs a massive overhaul anyway, so it honestly could be a positive side effect of increased EV usage.",Dodge
Fuck that. The last car to ‚Äúcling to‚Äù if you like American v8s is the Mustang.,Dodge
"That door looks super familiar, Michigan?",Dodge
I think the epa blame game is BS the car companies are just as much to blame for the hybrid mandates,Dodge

I received this poster in the mail after I purchased my SRT8  back in '09,Dodge
I'm pretty sure that is the rental car package... Makes it easy for them to order,Dodge
Dude read the news.,Dodge
Exactly personally tho I feel like the dodge dart looks extremely similar to the stratus but way less cool in my opinion,Dodge
Depends on what your household income is.  If you‚Äôre rich yeah go for it but if you‚Äôre paying an auto loan 1000 a week not a chance.,Dodge
Unfortunate they never had Dakota R/T with Hemi from factory. They could‚Äôve did it in 03/04,Dodge
No.,Dodge
I‚Äôm black,Dodge
Keep the charger,Dodge
I think Dodge and Chryslers days might be numbered,Dodge
I honestly am not sure since I opted for the gas savings at the time and got the SXT. could‚Äôve had the rt for $100 dollars more. Man was that a stupid move. lol. But at the time gas was nearing 4-5/gallon in Midwest.,Dodge
"As long as it drives and feel safe, you should be fine.  Any car can have issues at any time.  I imagine it wasn't driven hard, other than some decent miles.   People shit on everything on the Internet and yo can find bad stuff about anything.  I had a 2012 journey, only issue was the heat stopped working on the right hand side.  I messed with it for a year and then treaded it in.  Other than that, it for to 110k miles with zero other issues.  I actually miss it a bit.",Dodge
Idk im personaly a challenger kinda guy so...,Dodge
"This I actually do agree with. Our power network is 100 years old and is NOT set up for a mass EV craze. The US government needs to focus on upgrading infrastructure and providing more power in rural places, not mandating EVs by 2030.",Dodge
V8 or AWD?,Dodge
"Chargers, challengers, and 300‚Äôs basically are all the same chassis and everything is plug and play especially the drive train / interior. The only things you have to do custom are the tail lights and if you want the clock to work above the radio.

"ya know, i have owned every type of phone. iphone, hated it. after that i had an LG which was pretty good actually. later i had a samsung. which after hearing all the hype, i was kind of letdown, i found it wasnt anything special. after owning all those phones i decided to try something new. i figured since motorola is a company that only makes phones, that they would know something about phones and would produce good ones. is it good? not especially ü§î",Dodge

It is a thing with UConnect systems. There are updated versions out there. I‚Äôd check there first.,Dodge
"Ive known about two people with one. They said they haven‚Äôt had any problems. If you want something dodge, kinda fun, with a sports car like interior go for the dart. If you want something light on the wallet, reliable, gets you from point A to B. Go for anything but a dart.",Dodge

"Low on oil level. Oil pressure switch faulty. Could be a number of things, but those are most common",Dodge

Anytime you have an issue hit me up,Dodge
Stock 245 tires are horrible. Couple that with an open differential and 330 rwhp it will easily break loose when its wet out. Suggest upgrading to Continental extreme contact tires or something similar. Otherwise baby it as best you can when the roads are wet.,Dodge
"You seem to think theyre all EV or hybrid which i am here to tell you is false. 
And tbh, i didnt think it looked like a Charger either until i learned what model the body style is a callback to. If im not mistaken i think it has elements of the ‚Äò68 body style. 
The twin turbo inline 6 is still gonna be a beast on the streets for sure",Dodge
Well? Update.,Dodge
"I like the neon, myself.",Dodge
"The lack of a V8 will hurt sales just due to advertising. People think Charger and think V8 muscle car, even if they don't buy the V8.


There's a reason why the big three had a displacement race with V8s. It wasn't for power, it was for marketing as clearly 460<454<440 because bigger numbers.¬†


Now they will look at it as ""well, Ford has a V8, Dodge has 6...two more means more possible power"".


Also your usual Dodge buyer isn't buying efficiency, they're buying power, to be able to go fast, even if they don't.",Dodge
"Looks like a shitbox.

More SRT4 please.",Dodge
"As someone who‚Äôs owned both, i definitely was putting the 6.4s power to use, so i think this is just a thing for certain people",Dodge
"As someone else mentioned, go for a 2018+ just for Carplay/AA alone. It's a game changer.

But second best would be a 2014 or older RT with AWD. It is a SHAME the AWD RT was killed off just a couple years before AWD became mainstream on nearly every performance car. Especially if you're upping the power on it, this would make such a fun project car.",Dodge

How has the maintenance been? How many miles on it? lol no criticism,Dodge
"Looks very familiar to me.  Didn't have to replace the cam in my '06 Ram 1500, but I did have to replace the lifters.  Had an MDS lifter collapse so one of the cylinders was never firing.  Wasn't bad running on 7 cylinders, but when MDS kicked in it was only running on 3 and that was extremely rough.",Dodge
"M3 Comp xDrive... 3990lbs. 

Hellcat... 4428lbs.

At what ?,Dodge
I understand that. But I‚Äôm asking why not go with a new built 5.7. Sounds like it would be an easier and cheaper to go that route.,Dodge

I have known a couple though that were brought up in racing environments and were taught how to drive high performance and high horsepower vehicles. If it was just the average teenager, I wouldn't trust them with anything more than an RT to begin with, that's already a hell of a lot of power for somebody that doesn't know how to handle it and how to treat it. The persons attitude also means a hell of a lot in making that decision, someone that displays arrogance and doesn't know humility should not be driving one of these vehicles.",Dodge
Get the 3.09 I got it in my RT A8,Dodge
That won't happen. I'd buy one for sure for that though.,Dodge
Yea that doesn‚Äôt sound normal. In the 4 years I‚Äôve owned both my R/Ts I can‚Äôt think of an instance the light came on for me even spinning from a glees light when it‚Äôs raining.

"The jobs were already overseas since 2015, it was very obvious when Fiat trash-canned all the Chrysler Corporation projects. 


One of the many Scrapped Projects: The Pentastar Program was just beginning to enter its next phase of adding Turbos to replace the V8s and go after Ford‚Äôs Eco-Boost motors. The 3.6L Twin Turbo would replace the 5.7L and a new Pentastar 4.0L V6 would replace the 6.1L. These were designed from the ground up to take boost. They were essentially ‚Äúbaby hellcat motors‚Äù.

Fiat scrapped everything and went for the ‚Äúbeating the horse‚Äù until the CAFE fines outnumbered the profits‚Ä¶. Or until a new corporate platform was created.

Once the new Stellantis STLA Large Platform was ready, they introduced it with a Dodge-ish looking body on it first to pull the wool over the fan boys eyes. Then fire all the engineers who kept the LX/LD cars rolling until the end.

If Stellantis introduced the STLA Large under a Fiat, Alfa-Romero, Maserati, Jeep or Puegeot first.

"You might pick up 20-40hp at the wheels. Really the 392 in stock form is damn close to the maximum that design can put out. Comparatively speaking the truck 6.4 only makes 425hp.

You are dealing with a 20 year old design, it doesn't even have direct injection. It's essentially an LS2. There's only so much you can do before you hit the limits of the technology used. If you build the engine further you are going to rapidly hit the torque limits of the transmission.

If you want much more power than stock Scat puts out save your money and buy a Hellcat or wait on the new 550hp ""Six Pack"" models to arrive in 2025.",Dodge
