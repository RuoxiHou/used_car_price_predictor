"Pretty much the whole list you can do yourself. Although I don‚Äôt know what tunap is but being that it‚Äôs only $8 It‚Äôs probably just something you put in the fuel tank, which is totally unnecessary.  You could probably grab all these parts genuine Toyota online for about $70.",Toyota

I'm on my second one, a '19 Prius Prime I bought new has 507k miles on it today.  I use the car as a courier mainly doing long distance highway driving.  Basically just general maintenance other than replacing a water pump a few months ago.  About to do the first brake job on it soon.",Toyota

"So why do people think it's ok to walk into a dealership and expect an invoice deal? Is not the same with dealerships needing to cover costs as well as profit? Factor in that the salesperson only makes commission on the sale price over invoice, and all your doing is taking money out of his/her pocket so you can go tell your friends on the Internet that you stole the car from the dealership",Toyota

"My '23 Highlander has it, it's hill start assist. It activates when you press the brake on a sufficient incline. If you roll to a stop sign/hill and don't engage the brake long enough, it won't activate. Not sure if it's the same for a manual trans, it might do the same thing on a level surface to help keep the car from rolling back at a traffic light/stop sign so a new driver doesn't bump into someone.",Toyota
"Enjoy it, I love mine, I never thought of owning one (saying they look like a washing machine), until I drove one on a B Road with a lot of turns and it showed me what it can do.

How about humidity? Was the humidity enough to block your sensors?,Toyota
"The light comes on when you lose oil pressure, and when you lose oil pressure, then you no longer have an oil wedge between the crank and the bearings, and you damage the bearings. This results in irreparable damage to the motor. 

For the future, when that light comes on you're supposed to instantly shut the car down and coast to the side of the road if you want any chance of saving the engine. 

Also, you need to check your oil level every time you fill up with gas.",Toyota
Considering the current RAV4 is one of the most in demand cars in America I imagine they will just do a light update to the existing design and not something that is a radical departure. If it ain't broke don't try and fix it.,Toyota

"I have watched this video, a long with all of his other oil tests.  His test methods are the same, year after year. So, comparisons can be drawn based on test consistency.  This test was requested in the comments of his other oil test videos.  He states what he compares and he compares fairly based on his shop's capabilities.  The videos are fast-paced and concise.  His rating system is transparent, draw your own conclusions.  

This video title is misleading.  If you haven't watched the video, there is no value in a response saying it's good or bad since you don't know.  

Several manufacturers use brand name oil as OEM. Mobil 1 is recommended for several vehicles, my '23 SS Camaro is one of them (0-W40 Supercar).  In this video, it's just a direct comparison of four metrics, it's not exhaustive.

"Op any update? 
From the little information given, you could need to replace your 12v battery due to power steering operating electronically, and it's having a hard time charging to the correct voltage to operate normally. 

If you haven't replaced the battery, the usual life of batteries in my region (South East USA) is 2-3 years. 

Check the battery's health first. 

Or your entire power steering system is on the way out. Have it diagnosed somewhere worth their salt.

"Back when I was considering a Prius, I looked at cargurus and slid the miles slider bar to 300k and higher (they disabled that function later for some reason). All the Priuses turned yellow and were located in NY, and the highest ones had 375-450k and were still being sold as good running cars. That solidified my decision to get one. I chose a certified used 2010 with 19k, which now has 120k on it. One of the best cars I've ever owned.",Toyota

You can basically only run in full EV mode of your under 30 kph and your battery has enough charge. This is good for urban driving in neighborhoods for a short distance but that's about it. Your best bet is run it in eco mode in the cities when you're at 50 kph or less most of the time.,Toyota

"> If it gets enough traction it would be interesting to get a response from Mobile directly. The video has been out 2 days with over 500k views.

I don't think 500,000 views is enough to convince a petroleum giant like Mobile to comment on their oil formulation for Toyota.

"This is a pet peeve of mine, so I appologize if this sounds pedantic.

But *Toyota* didn't call you. A dealer did.

Toyota, as a corporate entity, is pretty straight forward and you know what you're going to get when you deal with them.

Dealers are locally owned and operated, with shockingly little oversight from Toyota Corporate.

It's usually okay to trust Toyota, so long as you understand what they're saying. The same cannot be said of dealers; there are honest ones and there are ones that are straight up crooks.

Sounds like the *dealer* you spoke to is closer to the crook end of the spectrum.",Toyota

"We have 3 older Toyota hybrids in the family. 2011 Prius 105k, 2012 CT200 with 160k and a 2014 Prius approaching 300k. All of them still running strong. We also have 3 newer Hybrids. An NX, NX plug in and RX. I think the oldest from that group is the NX which is a 18 or 19. Still too new for any issues. We also have a 300k Lexus ES330 in the family. All in all we have 15 Toyota's and Lexus in my extended family. The other 4 cars is a mid 2010 C class, 10th gen civic, Model Y and 3.

Family use to buy only American cars in the 80s. Early 90s a few germen/bit of everything but by the late 90s it was majority Toyota and Honda. By the mid 2000s majority Toyota. We got burned by the Honda transmission from the 90s 2000 V6 models.",Toyota

"Former Toyota Dealership Technician here:

So, no offense intended but I think you're misunderstanding the basic design of the vehicle and the Toyota Hybrid System (THS).

You have a gasoline (petrol/gas) powered internal combustion **engine** and 2 electric **motors**. They are referred to motor/generator 1 & 2.

Motor Generator One (MG1) is between the engine and ""eCVT transmission"" and functions like a starter, alternator, and Torque Converter and is bolted to the flexplate for the THS. It starts the petrol engine and then charges the HV battery as the vehicle goes down the roadway.

Motor Generator Two (MG2) is inside the ""transmission"" which consists of the MG and a small planetary gearset which functions like a CVT and splits power from MG2 and the ICE to propel the vehicle down the road and/or charge the HV battery. This is usually attached to a physical low speed gear in newer models depending on market.

Both MGs are constantly turning the difference is how much power is being demanded versus being supplied. Also, the power doesn't go straight to the HV battery or anywhere else for that matter without passing through the inverter/converter under the hood. 

This steps the power (Voltage) up or down as necessary as well as converting from AC to DC and vice versa. Both motors are constantly spinning which is generating Alternating Current (AC) at up to 500V, but this has to be converted to DC and stepped down to **an absolute maximum** of 240V (usually only 202V) to charge the HV battery. Furthermore, it has to be stepped up or down when:

*  the battery is providing part or all of the propulsion for the vehicle to MG2 (UP from 202V to 400-500V)
* the electrically operated air conditioning compressor is required or in most newer models a heat pump style system that does away with using coolant in the interior entirely and just reverses the flow of refrigerant. It runs solely off the HV battery voltage and current. (either a straight pass-through of HV battery voltage or stepping it DOWN from 400-500V to 240ish)
* there are demands from the 12V system (i.e. lights, switches, climate control, radio, etc). Almost everything **OUTSIDE** of the HV system runs on standard automotive 12V designs, including the electric water pump(s), internal cabin heaters, all computers, sensors, etc. (stepping DOWN from HV battery voltage to 12-14V DC) 

The electric only portion will **ONLY** work under very low load otherwise the ICE will start and run. Also, the HV battery has to be at least 50% charged, and with unobstructed cooling-you mentioned a blanket over the fresh air intake which is a big NO.

Running the climate control to heat up the cabin? Chances are the ICE will come on at some point.

Trunk/boot full of stuff? ICE will come on and stay on

Driving above a certain speed? Same thing.

Hilly terrain? While going uphill the ICE will go on but if you let off the accelerator pedal and just let it coast it will probably shut off. 

Look up ""pulse and glide"" technique or ""hypermiling"" at [www.PriusChat.com](https://www.PriusChat.com) to make the ICE cut off more often but the bottom line is that unless you are driving on FLAT roads with very little demand from the climate system or additional weight in the vehicle the ICE will be on with some frequency.

There is also a button to change the engine characteristics in most Toyota/Lexus vehicles from Power/Sport/Economy. If it's on Power, it won't turn the engine off at all.

Clean out the fresh air vent and replace the filter. They should be changed every 20-50k miles anyway just like the filter in your engine compartment.

Endurance tests, hot tests, stress tests, etc. Engineers make changes to the engine with that engine oil in mind. What am I saying. Ignore this and always go with OEM oil.

Sometimes they spray some anti squeal spray on the back of the brake pad which can smell funny the first few heat cycles. As well when brake rotors are brand new in the box, often times the manufacturer of the rotor puts a coat of an oily substance on them so they don't rust sitting on the shelf. You can get most of that off before install but not 100% of it. So first couple heat cycles it may burn off and even put out a little smoke.

I used this earlier this month for my corolla cross hybrid search. Identified which dealers had the make/trip/color I wanted. Test drove the car I wanted at one dealer, they showed me 5k above MSRP, I said okay thanks and left. Next day they texted me with a price 3k above MSRP. Meanwhile, I went and expressed interest online in a car via another dealer further away, one that didn't seem to markup above MSRP, worked with them via email to get a price sheet at MSRP, and then I offered the original dealer an opportunity match the price down to MSRP, which they did. Maybe could've pushed both a little further, but whatever, wasn't worth the hassle at that point.",Toyota

I opted to pay a shop to do it since I wanted it wired into the fuse box so that it didn't tie up an outlet and they hid the wire behind the trim and wired it in so that it turns on when the car turns on and turns off when the car is off. I took it to a car audio shop that also does window tinting and they did my window tinting and installed the dash cam on the same visit. It was $120 for the dash cam install.",Toyota

Something I rarely see mentioned is engines in a Hybrid lead a very sedate existence.  When I'm going down the freeway at 75-80 mph, the engine is turning 1,700 rpm.

Most modern cars have methods of dealing with cold starts/stops and how they affect the vehicle. Also your engine doesn't take that long to warm up either a minute or two of normal operation so unless your commute is walking distance you are probably warming up the car just fine. Finally hybrids frequently shut down the engine even when in constant usage so it doesn't really apply to hybids in the same way. That's why Prius's are targets for meth-heads the nation over for the Catalytic converters because they are so much bigger to accommodate for the engine cycling up and down all the time and the increased emissions that come from that.,Toyota

"Which is the main reason I wish Toyota had a backup 12v starter like Honda hybrids. They'll use the HV battery and drive motor to start the engine if it can, but if the hybrid battery is dead it'll crank the engine like a normal ICE car then immediately start charging the HV battery. I limped an 05 civic hybrid around with a bad battery for like 2 years, it'll start and be pulling power to charge for about 10min before it'll start providing any assist, by 30min into driving for the day it'd have full power and start/stop the engine using the drive motor. Overnight it's back to starting on 12v though.",Toyota

"Literally the entire list. 

I'm personally a believer of doing the recommended basic service intervals at the dealer while you're in warranty, just so they can't say anything to you if something goes wrong with the car. 

But outside that, there's nothing there you can't DIY. In fact *most* of the service intervals on cars can be done by the average person with any amount of effort and time invested. 

Rotating wheels, changing brake pads, oil changes, even basic spark plugs many years into ownership. It's all actually very simple and these are the jobs they give to the new apprentices and mechanics to start learning because they require so little supervision.

Things change as you get more advanced services and meaningful repairs, or as things begin to get old and brittle (plastic) or rusty (metal). Because once things begin to seize, or not fit right, or get worn experience tells you when an oil pan drain plug bolt should be changed to avoid damaging an oil pan's threads and when you need to do something extra to be sure you don't make things worse for example.

But a lot of basic maintenance is very easy. Whether you have the space and time to do the work is the bigger determinant at some point. Like, if I had to take a day off work to change my oil because my wife, kids and I have been sick for weeks off and on, and the weekend is too busy, then I'll pay someone else to do it. If I was in an apartment complex without door parking in the middle of winter, I'm not doing an oil change either. For example.",Toyota
For collectors that‚Äôs not true. Look up the older 80 series that were the equivalent of these ‚Äú1st editions‚Äù if they were maintained and with low miles they‚Äôre going for ridiculous prices now.,Toyota
"one thing to note is that toll on a taxi car (and arguably on the driver's health) is quite hefty

in contrast, running 600k mi (over the course of 8 yrs, so an avg of 75k mi/year) as a long distance commuter with mostly highway miles would be much less taxing

just a testament to the incredibly durability on these things",Toyota
Depends on how much power you are using. There‚Äôs actually a company called Plugout Power that adds an AC inverter to the high voltage battery. It basically turns your hybrid vehicle into a generator for emergencies. People say they can power their essentials for long periods of time in an emergency this way.,Toyota
"That‚Äôs good in todays market. I‚Äôm kicking myself that I should‚Äôve bought later. I bought my new 24 rav4 hybrid February 9th, at the time the lowest I could get was 7%, From the dealership. Luckily I was able to get 5.29% outside the dealership which isn‚Äôt too bad. I‚Äôll probably refinance later on when they keep dropping. My wife and I have 790 credit score each.",Toyota
"I will bring this up to the dealer, but I'm curious if other people experience this with their 24 Camry's as well. It doesn't happen all the time, so odds are they won't be able to replicate it and I'll get the ""car is working as intended"" response.",Toyota

You're correct.,Toyota
"Hybrids are great for taxis and high mileage drivers in congested areas.  I traded my Venza hybrid for a 2024 gas turbo.  As a low mileage driver, in light suburb traffic, my battery would need replacement at 40,000 miles, based on the warranted 10 year life.",Toyota

"Interestingly you mention that the Mark 4 has appreciated because supply is below demand. That reinforces that such a scenario can increase the asking price of a vehicle beyond even its original price. So long as that is the case the market will reflect the average price given those circumstances. You're right modern high production common cars don't appreciate but no one is getting ""bent over"" when buying them.
 
Something is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. No one is owed a car. It's a commodity, in a way, and as long as the terms and figures are agreeable, then all parties should be satisfied. Someone paying more than you would does not mean they were taken advantage of. If that were the case you wouldn't step foot in a grocery store without a fistful of coupons.  I can assure you dealerships are adapting. Common cars like the Prius are sparsely available (at the moment) comparative to what they once were so there's a premium on them that will likely only last until the demand matches or falls short of supply. Such is the ebb and flow of business based on market forces.",Toyota

"a 2020 with 50k for less than 18k is crazy, at least in los angeles 

The average like 2019-2020 corolla here was 18-19k. I bought my 2021 corolla with 60,000 miles for 15,000 from a Chrysler dealership because they were trying to get rid of it, I went to the dealer asap to secure that deal. 

I think if you can expand your budget by a couple racks you‚Äôre more likely to get a 2020+ with 50k miles 

The Corolla and Camry are the best picks for around this price and i‚Äôll tell you their strengths/ weaknesses

Corolla: small on the outside but not small on the inside (i‚Äôm 6‚Äô2 and my corolla is a fine size for me) and parking is extra easy since it‚Äôs a compact car. It‚Äôs better mileage and the 2020 has a nice big ipad for infotainment if that‚Äôs what you prefer

the cons are that you hear a lot of road noise, especially on the freeway. It‚Äôs also dark, not a lot of lights on the inside so you‚Äôll have to use the lights on the ceiling 

Camry: pros are that it‚Äôs bigger and therefore roomier, you hear considerably less road noise compared to the corolla. It has a worse fuel economy but not by much, and parking while not hard isn‚Äôt as easy due to its size. The camry has a more traditional screen instead of an ipad like infotainment screen if that‚Äôs something you consider a negative",Toyota
Oh yeah. The diesel variant is at least 4 cylinder but generally for short distances diesel doesn't really make a lot of sense. I had a diesel Astra F and for short distances it's not that great but for long distances it's like a Chariot in comparison. But I feel like if you buy an old Yaris or any Aygo that it just requires some upgrades before it gets better with the noise and other comfort features.,Toyota

My only concern would be the impact to oil life. Cold starts run rich to heat up the catalytic converter. A rich a/f will cause fuel dilution in the oil, which will thin down the oil‚Äôs viscosity. Also, if the engine is run but does not get up to operating temp, then condensation will form.

"1. There's online calculators that help you figure that out. Depends on gas price, the miles you drive a year and the cost difference between gas and hybrid. IIRC when I was looking, a Corolla takes 3-5 years of 15k mi/year for the hybrid to come out on top, and for a Rav4 it was closer to 7-9 years.
2. For minimizing gas and maintenance expenditure, I would say hybrid vs gas matters the most, because of the eCVT vs CVT (although Toyota CVTs are very reliable, the eCVT is pretty bulletproof), the less wear on things like brake pads/starter (or the lack of starter) and that the engine gets used less during EV mode. Miles and year are kind of case-by-case. IMO the year matters the least for maintenance but may matter more for safety and creature comforts.
3. I think only the Prius and Rav4 have plug in variants (prime). A Camry or Corolla never gets plugged in, it just gets the energy from brake regen, and the engine when it's efficient or needed.",Toyota

You can press the ev button and (mine) goes 1.2 miles fully electric as long as you're under 30mph. Otherwise the battery is simply charging whilst you're decelerating or braking. Sometimes if you are very low mph and not really accelerating at all you might be fully electric but I certainly haven't noticed any difference in fuel consumption from my fully petrol previous car,Toyota

Yeah we do all the financing paperwork after you test drive the actual vehicle once it‚Äôs here,Toyota
"Yeah, but I feel like you can get stuck with a paid off car too. That's kinda where I'm at.

In 2020 during covid, I was able to snag a 2014 Ford Expedition EL with 154k for $8,275 after taxes/fees. I got hit in a parking lot by a 16 year old and got an additional $1,200 check for some quarter panel damage about a year into owning it as a nice bonus.

Realistically, it's probably worth what I paid roughly still with 184,000 miles on it now.

It gets an awful 13 mpg. But, I've got heated seats, leather, it runs fine, and I'm pretty happy with it otherwise. 

I'd like better gas mileage but there's no reasonable way for me to get out of a perfectly fine car that's paid off to get something with better gas mileage.

I'm looking at it at this point like I'm probably stuck with this car until something absolutely catastrophic happens, which could easily be another decade.

I'd like something that's more like 25-30MPG, I'd take something like a newer AWD crossover... but the used price on stuff is inflated (plus risk of getting a dud), and the new prices are stupid now. 

With gas at $3.50+ a gallon right now driving even short distances is a noticeable price lol.",Toyota

"I love how you contradict yourself here. Used cars don't appreciate! (Well some do but that's not what we're talking about.) So do they or don't they? Used cars appreciated because demand exceeded supply which is business 101 and only unusual because that doesn't happen often in the car industry. Markups existed before the pandemic, they just weren't as egregious and low rates plus negotiable dealers made them less noteworthy. New care inventory is building sure but it's nowhere near where it was pre-pandemic and it's unlikely it ever will. I guarantee you there are no new car stores ""camping on inventory"". I couldn't sell you a new Sienna or Sequoia right now for invoice if I wanted to because they FLY off the transporters. The Landcruiser will be even worse. If you feel a vehicle is more expensive than suits your taste, fine. To say someone is being ripped off continues to be a silly sentiment to me. I'd rather pay 80K for a Toyota product I'll likely be able to drive for a decade plus than a BMW that I'll get laughed at if I didn't lease.",Toyota

"You're probably better off just going with the Camry - it's much less drama. Toyota has apparently constricted production of the Prius severely. The Prius is almost impossible to find these days and is always massively marked up by the dealers now - seemingly out of spite. I've been trying to find one for months; no dealer even has them in inventory and I haven't spoken to any who have said they expect them anytime soon - they just get one-offs that are already sold before they even arrive at the lot. Apparently you have to purchase them before you even see them - let alone test drive it. Toyota has some notion that they want to sell them like an Amazon product; where brick and mortar locations are cut out of the loop entirely. You'll just wind up paying a massive amount more for the Prius and it will be a bare-bones vehicle with minimal options. It almost appears that Toyota may be trying to kill the Prius altogether; they've fallen way behind demand on them and they don't seem to have any interest in trying to catch up. 

The corporate culture at Toyota has become really, really weird over the last few years (Elon fan-boys playing with ketamine and MDMA; it's really becoming an epidemic in the new executive lifestyle). Their ""revolutionary"" ideas like ""Smart Path"" really only make sense to them. They claim they're going to revolutionize how you buy a car - but all they wind up doing is making it as confusing and nonsensical as possible. TBH I'm starting to think my next vehicle may not be a Toyota at all; which says a lot, I've been driving them since 1983 - but I just don't know if I trust them anymore; it seems like something is wrong there. I can't help but feel that drugged-out weirdness at the top of the corporation is eventually going to find it's way into the manufacturing and Toyota might soon become synonymous with Yugo.",Toyota

They got it super cheap, thinking they could flip it fast at a low price and make a few thou easy profit. It sat on their lot for six months as they kept ticking the price lower. Turns out when you target a clientele that's shopping for bling trucks, hardly anyone looking for a nice, affordable, basic truck bothers to even think about checking out your ads or lot.

"I remember using an early 90s Dodge Caravan to take a motorcycle to a few track days.  With the 2nd and 3rd row seats out, I used the seat mounting points as tie-down points for the bike.  I was literally able to fit all my riding gear, my tools, and track-specific equipment in it, without any problems.  If I did that with a truck I would have had to tie down everything in the back (as in, not just the bike) to make sure it wouldn't fly away.  But with the van, I just secured the heaviest stuff (the bike and generator) to keep it from shifting and everything was safe because it was enclosed.  And most pickups nowadays won't even fit the bike itself without the tailgate being open.

The early 2000s Toyota Sienna I mentioned in my first comment?  Still got it.  It spends most of the year with the 2nd and 3rd row seats in storage.  I can fit a full-sized ladder in there.  Trips to the plumbing supply shop or lumberyard are a breeze.  There hasn't been a single home improvement project in over a decade that it couldn't handle.  And once every couple of years the seats go back in so my sister can use it with her family when they visit our parents.

I like the way most of the Toyota trucks have looked over the years.  But when I seriously consider the utility of one, none of them win against a van.  Maybe if I lived on a farm and was driving it through fields and orchards I would feel differently.  But I'm not, and neither are most of the people driving trucks around me.",Toyota

"As long as you:

1. Don‚Äôt let the hybrid battery drain to zero (that can wreak havoc on the battery), 

2. Perform the maintenance by the calendar (6 months/1 year, etc‚Ä¶), and

3. Take it out at least once a month and drive it on the highway to get it up to operating temperature (this ensures no corrosive condensation and fuel sit in the oil pan)

You should be okay. Here‚Äôs the kicker, if you‚Äôre not driving it, it might not be cost effective. 

New hybrids cost a lot more than an ICE car. The main savings is on fuel and maintenance, so if you‚Äôre not driving much, your savings might never make up the difference in the initial cost. If you‚Äôre only driving few thousand miles a year I‚Äôd suggest looking into a used hybrid that has had good maintenance records. Maybe a CPO hybrid.",Toyota

Get it to a reputable shop for a thorough inspection before buying.


Generally they are great cars and I drive a 1998 myself. With that being said, there are a few issues to look out for. Oil burning is more prevalent on the VVT-i models from 2000-2002 while the 1998-1999 are not as much but it all depends on maintenance. The reason for oil burning is that the piston rings get gummed up and a lack of oil return holes on the piston grooves. The pistons were smaller than usual and to compensate, Toyota added bigger piston rings that I believe are low tension. If it is actually burning oil and it‚Äôs not the PCV valve, then you‚Äôd have to rebuild the engine. There is a video on YouTube with a guy who did an entire engine rebuild on a 2000. Also oil leaks around the valve cover could be a source of losing oil but usually that is just seepage. Valve covers on these things are easy to replace. The timing cover if it isn‚Äôt the tensioner is also another area to look out for leaks as well. 

Also if you are in the salt belt, check the fuel lines and brake lines for rust and leakage. Also body should ideally be in good shape if maintained a waxing regime otherwise the quarter panel rear wheel arch area seems to be a common area for rust. Check the fuel filler neck as well.

This is more of an annoyance but the inner door seal vinyl tends to warp and discolour over time. Toyota did revise these seals with an all black rubber one but they are a bit pricey so I‚Äôd check a junkyard for non warped seals to get to save money. 

Make sure the suspension components like the struts aren‚Äôt leaking, the sway bar link boots aren‚Äôt torn and the bushings as well. Also make sure the control arms aren‚Äôt clunking. Make sure your wheel bearings are okay.

Oh, and make sure there is no check engine light. The common reason why these would be on is because of a broken VSV valve.

These are some of the things I have thought up on my mind so far and there are countless others but it all depends on how this unit is maintained.",Toyota

Also, make sure to set aside funds each month for maintenance and repair costs in addition to fuel costs.

You and your twin are smart to consider a Toyota or a Lexus. Depending on how expensive fuel is in your area, you may want to get the Toyota instead of the Lexus. My son purchased a 2005 Honda Pilot EXL for 2K. He‚Äôs happy with it even though it requires Premium gas and doesn‚Äôt have the best fuel economy. Regular works for my 2018 Camry.

Also with your age, you and your twin may want to get an under 10K vehicle as that should help with the insurance premiums. Keep the remaining 8K as a cushion.

This model of the Camry is notorious for burning oil at high mileage if not taken care of meticulously, hence why I always advise for 5K mile oil changes rather than 10K like Toyota does nowadays, but even that isn't a guarantee for this specific engine.

There's no fixing this without engine replacement or teardown and rebuild so like the other comment said you need to keep oil on you at all times and inspect the oil level at every fill up and top off as needed or do your oil changes probably every 3-4K at this point.

The vibration resonates with a bunch of body panels and makes it feel worse than it is. Now the f150s on the other hand I'm 100% convinced will be getting new recalls soon. I'd say about 40% of the ones I drive with the 3.5 or 3.7 ecoboost have fucked up transmissions with <20mi on the odometer. Like get in and it pops up ""park unavailable, apply parking brake before exiting"" and it pops up again and chirps at you any time you go below 5mph. Most of those also have no idea what gear to be in, will redline in 1st then fall on their face in 7th then downshift and string out 3rd then get stuck in 5th and almost stall coming to a stop. Sometimes they'll rev hang and keep accelerating harder after you let off the gas then go about 5 seconds of dead pedal before it'll do anything again. 0/10 would not recommend an ecoboost 2024 f150. I love the handling of the rangers, id take a 2.3 over a 3.5 though. Not sure why but they feel faster and more nimble, like the extra power of the 3.5 doesn't overcome it's extra weight combined with the extra interior goodies included in the higher trims that usually have the 3.5. And on that note, the broncos handle incredibly well but are stupid slow for having the same drivetrain options, a 2.3 ranger is faster than even a 3.7 bronco. If you're gonna go with an f150, I'm in love with the 3.5 powerboost. I haven't had a single one with issues yet, on a 18mi run I average like 29-34mpg depending on how I drive it compared to like 13-17 in a 3.7 ecoboost, 14-19 in a 3.5 ecoboost, like 12 consistently in a 5.0 whether it's in sport having fun or eco babying it. The lightnings are amazing to drive but I wouldn't buy one unless they like triple the battery pack size, $80k window sticker price for 200mi range at full charge in eco is insane. Give it a like 350kwh pack and I'd sell body parts for a lightning platinum. There's a bunch of f150 LOBOs on some of the lots we go to but I haven't gotten to drive one yet, today they found out I know how to drive manual and was stuck in 7 speed/2.3 ecoboost broncos the rest of the day because I'm one of 2 people across 5 vans of 10 drivers each that can drive manual and they had a whole line that needed moved.",Toyota

No the dealer can't disable that. It's likely part of a technology pack that your car didn't have or an added feature that didn't come as part of the car from Toyota. The manual wouldn't differentiate. It's often one manual per car or trim line that assumes you have every option.,Toyota

During covid yea sure, but now even when I pass the ford dealership next to me, the lot is FILLED with broncos. Broncos had similar waitlists during covid, and were impossible to find.

Its mechanical amenities are everything you'd ever want in a daily driver, from a powerful engine with 236 hp and a hybrid transmission for great gas mileage, to AWD and an above-average ground clearance (almost 6""). The interior seems downright luxurious, and I'm a fan of the multimedia display placement that looks like an integral part of the dashboard rather than an iPad glued to the surface.

I've heard the trunk is surprisingly small for the car's size; the car's exterior design would have you think that it was actually a liftback (much like the Honda Civic hatchback's sloping design), so I'm surprised Toyota didn't go this route.

Yea, I only pay attention to smiles per gallon, which is quite high even tho my gas tanks last 180-200 miles, haha. You could compare your high fuel costs to a new car payment, but yea at least you're able to pick and choose when you get gas bills vs having rhe bank come a calling every month, or else! 

You could start saving cash for another 8 grand vehicle and, this time, pick something smaller/lighter for better mpg. Whatever value is left on the truck can go back in your pocket via private sale, and then you're a hella lot wiser this time around your next purchase. You're able to find something better,nicer condition, and more suited to your needs as you did well sticking it out in the current truck. Win win! 

The hard part is being able to check out a used car, and know how much value it's got left. Once you get good at that and knowing the ins and outs of the specific vehicle you want, the used car market is your oyster! 

In the meantime, you have mostly reliable transportation and no monthly expenses other than fuel and insurance! You're killing it!

Starting the engine and not driving/running it for long enough to warm up particularly in colder climates can cause condensation inside the engine and subsequently increased engine wear. I would recommend changing your oil every 5k miles/6 months instead of 10k miles/1 year. Not much you can do about increased battery/starter wear besides keep a battery charger around or replace them preemptively. I know your struggle my wife and I share a single lane driveway and are constantly switching cars and it‚Äôs one of the main reasons we do a 5k mile oil change intervals on our Toyotas.,Toyota

"Toyota hybrids tend to require much less maintenance. They don‚Äôt have some parts like drive belts, starters, alternator, or torque converters. All of those functions are filled by the transmission and hybrid motors. 

The water pump and A/C compressor are electric, so they only spin when needed and the engine only runs part time, so wear is significantly reduced. 

The brakes are preserved by the regenerative breaking system. My 2012 Camry Hybrid is still on the factory brake pads and they have at least a year of life left. 

The 12 volt battery is minimally used and also lasts a long time. The hybrid battery is designed to last the life of the car and mine still works like it was brand new.

The caveat is that you MUST perform the regular maintenance, especially the oil and coolant changes when directed.",Toyota

"Yeah that's pretty much it and since we just went through a supply shock the normalization of inventory is playing out in real time right now which is why you see softening prices in the used car market generally speaking. Dealers are low-balling offers now. They are not taking anything they can get their hands on anymore. There is a very good reason behind this. They don't know what the price on that vehicle is going to be in 30, 60 or 90 days. Some cars have been dropping rather severely with thousands and thousands of dollars off per 30 days at Manheim. This can be a very bad day if you're a used car dealer",Toyota
"Not good for the starter or battery‚Äôs health if the battery isn‚Äôt getting recharged afterwords (by driving for at least 20 minutes after each start, or by putting on a maintainer afterwords).

"No prius comes with AWD last I heard. Also if you want to save on gas, why are you going for AWD anyway? I get that you live in Canada and want more traction for the snow but AWD effectivity on snow is a myth. You need winter tires for snow.

For that money, you can do one of two things: Save it and get a decent but older used car on marketplace, or spend it on a newer certified used at a dealership. The only reason I mention the latter is because of the warranties. 

If you‚Äôre looking in the $8-10k range, marketplace is ok, but if you have a budget of $18k, you can get into something that has a strong warranty. Sometimes the Certified used warranties are better than the new car warranties. 

You‚Äôre 17, probably working your first job, probably heading off to college. The last thing you need is to be nickel and dimed. Personally, I‚Äôd find an older Camry or Avalon on marketplace and just save the money.
