"I dont mean to scare you, but this generation 2.0tsi 210hp in one of the worst Tsi engines made with poor reliability. In my workshop i have experiences with 3 of them in the last 2 years. Their main problems are: 
- stuck piston rings which lead to seized engine, usually around 150-200k mark
- cracked cylinder walls between nr 2-3 cylinder.
And of course the usuall carbon buildup problems, but you can prevent it by not always driving short journey and being alittle bit more spirited in the gas pedal and ofcourse Tsi specific and Tsi specific engine oil only with 1yr/10k km intervals. :)

"Also. Need to consider that Europe is VW's primary market by a huge margin (Something like 80% Europe, 20% everywhere else if memory serves), everything is made with Europeans laws and regulation in mind first and foremost.

500kg to do campervan stuff while also leaving room for a bigger battery and the ability for the owners to put enough stuff in for a 2 adults + 2 kids trip is quite difficult and would need significant compromises. It's just not worth it, especially when the VW California (Modern Transporter-based Westfalia, not sold in the US) is selling like hotcakes already.

"Diesels in the America became a bad word in the late 70's after the Olds 350 debacle. Oldsmobile took a 350 gasser and converted it to diesel. Needless to say it was a gutless, unreliable boat anchor. The cars they put them in were big, square, inefficient bricks. These cars could barely hit 80 mph (120km). The engines failed a ton, and the dealers would just replace them with a gasoline V8 under warranty.

Also, GM was really bad about how they implemented their diesels in passenger cars. They didn't use lift pumps, meaning the injection pump had to work overtime to pull the fuel from the tank and also feed the injectors. The glow plug circuits were wired to the starter solenoid like an ignition accessory with a relay, which led to a ton of burnout, and malfunctioning plugs. A nightmare in cold states, and a fire hazard in hot states. They used the same internals and cylinder heads as the gasser V8, only *slightly reworked*. So they blew head gaskets, cracked heads, and killed bearings constantly. The transmissions they used were the same units used on gassers. So they were geared wrong, and that didn't help the underpowered engines. GM mostly installed the diesels in their Cadillac, Buick, and Oldsmobile brands. These brands were the more luxurious, or the ""mature brands"" from General Motors. The customers didn't like the smell from the exhaust, and didn't like the soot and black smoke. They compared it to big 18 wheelers. Also, buying diesel fuel was a major pain in the ass. Back then, few gas stations carried diesel. You had to go to a truck stop, or one of these full service gas stations. It was an inconvenience for both the driver of the cars and the driver of trucks. Imagine you're a big 18 wheeler, and some guy in his puny Cadillac is in your blind spot, or blocking you out? And vice versa. Or the soccer mom shows up with 5 kids, tearing the place up, double parking, taking her sweet time. ü§£

Diesel was forced on the public as an emergency after the fuel crisis of 73. After that fiasco, manufacturers scrambled to find a solution, and the easiest one was diesel. They cut a lot of corners, and took shortcuts which proved disastrous. Then by the late 80's, things normalized. Gas was plentiful and cheap again, and most ppl just wanted to forget diesels ever happened. That's pretty much carried on to present day. In the  late 2000's, after the big gasoline price spike, diesels started to make a comeback. But... then VW dieselgate happened, and that was the end of the road for diesel passenger cars in America ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Volkswagen

"Any locksmith should be able to pick your car's lock and cut a new key.

The issue is programming the car to the fob.  The aftermarket fobs are not coded and the dealer can not code the aftermarket keys.  You may be able to code an aftermarket fob but then you need to program your ECU/BCM to the new coded fob.

My Autel IM508 can code an aftermarket fob.  I can also reprogram the unencrypted ECU/BCM to the new coded aftermarket fob....but the coding presents errors that a VCDS scan notes.  The IM 508 costs about $1k.  Supposedly the IM608 works better but it is closer to $3k. 

Save yourself some time, money, frustration, and go to the dealer.  Get a factory fob which is pre-coded and have the dealer reprogram your ECU and BCM to accept the new factory key.

Background....I bought a 2011 Audi A4 with ""All keys lost"".  I was fortunate that model year car had an unencrypted ECU/BCM.  VAG revised their immobilizer and my Autel 508 can not program my 2015 Audi A4....to make matters worse I scrambled my steering module in the process.

"Base on this forum exchange in German about a Passat (3C) previously used as a taxi, I don't think this is the correct answer. I think this is a push-to-talk button for radios installed in commercial vehicles: https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/ehemaliges-taxi-freie-stecker-und-taster-fuer-was-t1895488.html?page=1

If this is correct, ""F"" would stand for ""Funkger√§t"" (""radio"") and ""S"" for ""senden"" (""to send"") or ""sprechen"" (""to speak"").

Update: Someone else solved the mystery: ""FS"" is ""Funktionsschalter"", which is essentially a multifunction switch. It can be wired for different purposes: dome light, radio, search light, etc.",Volkswagen
"The car is probably in limp mode. On VW's (and other cars) the TCM locks itself into 3rd gear and limits the max RPM to 3000 as a failsafe. On these 01M Transmissions, that usually means it's done and needs to either be rebuilt, replaced, or as most VW people do, convert it to a manual. My 01M grenaded at only 28k miles in 2005. Luckily it was replaced under warranty, and I have religiously taken care of it ever since. 

If you want these transmissions to last, I found you should change the fluid and filter about every 50k miles, lock it into sport mode (via VCDS), and be gentle with the downshifts. So far it has worked well for me, and this 2nd 01M is about to drag my Jetta to 200k miles.

The code (P0743) is for the torque converter clutch solenoid circuit in the transmission. I think there is a likely chance that the wiring is bad for that circuit and is open, as the wiring done inside these transmissions is a little fragile. The code itself is what prompted the car to go into limp mode as a failsafe. The only way I think you can solve this issue is by taking it to a shop sadly, unless you want to try it yourself which I find to be too risky on these automatic transmissions.",Volkswagen

"Situations like these are tough because you have no idea how this car was built or how the reliability has been or will be in the future. The damage on the Carfax might not be anything serious.

"Hi, I had to make the same decision and I ended with the multivan. The family -wife and kids- unanimously prefer the multvan as it's more comfortable for passengers. I would say the most important thing to inform your decision is how you plan to use it. What are you buying it for? We mostly use it for the school run and commute. For this driving electric on a car platform is a lot better than driving diesel on a van platform. If you are going to do long trips and road driving rather than city driving I would choose diesel. Also depends how much weight you are planning to move. Passengers with luggage is perfectly fine for the multivan but machinery, construction materials and the like is too much, for that you need a proper van.


If you are going to use it mostly like a big family car, multivan much better. If you are going to use it like a work van, Caravelle much better.

I had it on my hand and accidently touched a faded black plastic piece. When I tried to wipe it off, the piece looked brand new. When I had my 08 Wolfsburg Jetta, it had a back bumper that was half plastic and I used it every like 5 washes. I put it on goopy and let it sit for about 10-15 minutes (if you smoke, have a cigarette and by the time you're done it should be good, that's what I did) and then wipe off all of the excess and rub it in really good. Another thing I would do is make sure I had extra time before doing it and I would let it sit to soak in and ""dry"" (it never really dries) for a while so road stuff didn't stick to it.

If you use this trick, either bring Dawn and a lot of water or wear gloves (or get them and go home to do it). It's super thick and oily, so it's hard to wash off your skin.",Volkswagen

"I'm not arguing that many people drive that far, it's just very much not the norm.  It still seems like for the longer range EVs that would not be a problem, though I understand real world range can vary especially in the cold. But I mean yeah, those people can simply not buy an EV for the time being.  I'm not saying everyone is required to!

And I conceded above that the convenience of an EV assumed you live in a single family home which many don't.  That's something the EV industry is going to have to figure out with a combination of more public charging stations, longer ranger, and faster charging. 

I just think that a lot of people's objections aren't very rational and are based in (1) an emotional connection to ICEs (2) a tribalistic political stance, or (3) general fear of change. If your commute is several hundred miles a day that does not apply to you.",Volkswagen

Don't take my word for it, Google is your friend. Look it up. This has been an issue plaguing these units for years. Especially common on MINI's.

Also, have to disagree about special training and certifications, bla bla bla. The aftermarket has solved more issues on these units than the manufacturer has. Which btw is not VW. These are made by Aisin, and licensed to VW. VW doesn't do jack shit but have the monkeys pull it at the dealer, then ship it to Aisin for refurbishment. That's why the guys at the dealer know fuck all about where to even begin with these.

I cut my teeth at a Volkswagen dealer for almost a decade, then I went independent. What I learned was that I was in a bubble at the dealer. The real ""specialists"" were the guys tackling all the problems these cars give out of warranty that no sane individual would pay dealership rates to R&R many issues which were actually very fixable. Many times for 60-70% less than what the dealer would have charged to wastefully replace.

"Back in 2021 when the vehicle shortage was at an all time high I worked for the biggest scum dealership in the province. I was constantly ripped off on my commissions and management thought it was funny. Our lot only had 12 cars on it.

I finally had enough when I sold 14 cars and made $1900 before taxes. I WAS DONE‚Ä¶ but I wanted revenge. The management has to feel a taste of their own medicine. So I drew up the ultimate gameplan.

My friends father had waited 2 years for his C8 Corvette that he ordered. He was lucky enough to get it 7% under MSRP, basically at dealer invoice. He paid around $78,000 out the door for it.

I called him and said that I can make him some money as those corvettes were selling for way over MSRP. He agreed to sell it, and said he would take $100,000 for it. So I told my GM and Sales manager about it for a buy in. They check that they were selling for $140,000+ and they were LICKING THEIR CHOPS. I had them under the impression he will sell the vehicle to us for 100k


So I spoke with my buddies dad and told him when he shows up with the his brand new car with 100km on it to say he has offers for $130,000.. he said if I can actually get him that he will give me $15,000

Long story short he showed up and put the pressure on my management, and they ended up giving him $130,000‚Ä¶. He gave me my $15,000 and I quit right on the spot.

"Make sure you don't have the oil filter housing leak. When this one leaks, you empty the housing. The oil pump then has to refill the housing with oil, and then the oil continues on to lubricate the top of the engine. There is a lapse of lubrication while the housing is refilling, that means the chain, tensioner, and all the upper valve train will starve for oil provisionally. This results in noise. And accelerated wear of the components.

As it pulled out onto the main road it closed, but opened again as it came to a stop at a junction. Once again after it started moving it closed over again, just to open again as it came to a stop to make a turn, at which point I was no longer behind it.

"Stratified charge engines (the S in TSI actually stands for stratified) such as diesels and direct injected gas engines make more soot than homegeonous charge (port injected) engines. This is due to the size of the fuel droplets as well as the fact that the fuel is injected in discrete streams that don't mix well with the air charge prior to combustion. This poor mixing creates fuel rich areas in which combustion occurs, in spite of the fact that these are technically lean burn engines. More soot during combustion means dirty oil faster",Volkswagen

"I'm well familiar with how it works in Europe because my parents are Spanish and Portuguese. They migrated to America and I was born here. But I still have family over there, and visit frequently. Europe's infrastructure is very different. Smaller, more condensed cities, and distances are shorter. Public transportation is great. In some cities you don't even need a car. A bike or scooter will serve you well.

In America distances are long, cities are spread out and isolated. Public transportation sucks, and in some places doesn't even exist. ü§£

There is definitely politics involved, but I don't think car manufacturers want to ban diesels. It's just that for many, many, decades diesel fuel was relegated for commercial use only. Trucks, tractors, generators, etc. It was always an industrial solution. The few diesel engines car makers had, were mostly big V8's for heavy duty applications that didn't fit in passenger cars. When the big push for cleaner emissions and fuel economy started in the 2010's, many manufacturers were looking at smaller diesels for passenger car use, but the environmental board here got very strict about their use. Diesel emissions were vilified, and owning one became more of a headache than it should be. Needing DEF, and having nanny systems that prevent you from starting it if you run it without DEF for too long. Not to mention these systems add to the complexity of the vehicle, and are very expensive to fix.

The same is happening in Europe. With the emissions and wanting to replace all ICE with EV's. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the world is upside today.",Volkswagen

"That could mean 2 things, service is coming up OR something is up with the trans, try checking for faults using a scanner if you can, also if you have a rough down shift when slowing down, I‚Äôd remove and clean your throttle body assembly, it should fix that issue and the wrench",Volkswagen
"First step will be to remove the valve cover, the condition of the cam will tell you a lot.   Don't be afraid to remove a cap cam, just do one at a time and fully retorque it to spec.    If that all looks good, then go ahead and fix it.  If the cam journals looks scored , kinda looks like stripes running around it, then she's cooked.   That means it was ran without oil pressure. 

You'll have to get the oil pan off and clean out the pan, and pickup screen/tube. (Kind of a biatch on the longitudinal motors). 

After the first 1000km or so, do an oil flush additive, follow the procedure on the bottle and then fresh oil change.   Dramatically shorten up the next few oil changes.    I've been down this road with a 1.8t, you'll notice the oil will turn dark/black almost immediately after the oil change.  But after a few of those 1000 mile /1500km oil changes, oil will actually start to stay clean.

Don't forget to only run the updated larger/ extra capacity oil filter.",Volkswagen

In 2005 VW was looking to invest heavily in the U.S. market. They promised to bring a new plant, and jobs to America. Fast forward to 2008: Chattanooga, TN was announced and completed in 2011. Around that same time, Ford and Dodge had dropped out of the small truck race. Leaving only GM as the sole small truck maker. Well, really The Dakota was never a small truck, but that's a discussion for another Reddit.

VW attempted to take advantage of this and try to have the tariffs on trucks and commercial vehicles lifted. They wanted to introduce the Amarok, as well as the Touran, and Transporter into this market. Things were in talks, but the Big 3 pushed back on this. Unions lobbied congress. See VW was looking to hire a lot of workers from the truck and van plants, some who had been laid off by Ford but had signed non compete  clauses. Things reached stalemate and then dieselgate happened (2015), and that was the end of the talks about VW bringing their commercial arm to America üò¢.",Volkswagen

As the other commenter said, your biggest concern is going to be rodents in the engine compartment. Take a look inside and look for signs of activity like frayed wires, nests, and droppings. 

Check the engine air intake and the cabin air intake for nests. Those are both things you can figure out easily with Google if you have zero experience with this kind of stuff and you won‚Äôt hurt your car. Make sure you don‚Äôt drop any screws from the air intake if it has them and they aren‚Äôt captive. They are captive in my Passat and probably will be for yours. 

The only other thing I‚Äôd be worried about is the tires. They can deform from sitting for too long and develop flat spots (flatspotting). You‚Äôll probably be okay and they‚Äôll go round again but there might be some vibration at the beginning. The tires on my car were permanently flatspotted after six years but I could still drive on them, albeit not comfortably. 

This is up to you, but I would add a can of Liquid Moly gasoline system cleaner to your fuel tank and change the oil.",Volkswagen

It states the following:  The term ‚Äúdry leaks‚Äù in the context of a Volkswagen (VW) warranty likely refers to leaks that are not actively dripping or leaving wet spots, but rather, they show evidence of a past leak, such as stains or residue. These could be from oil, coolant, or other fluids. If a VW warranty specifies that it does not cover dry leaks, it means that the warranty will not cover repairs or replacements for parts that show signs of these non-active leaks.¬†It‚Äôs important to note that warranty coverage can vary, so for the most accurate information, it‚Äôs best to consult the warranty documentation or contact a VW dealer directly1.

I‚Äôll make it clear, I do not like dealers either, but if it‚Äôs between a Indy shop that has no trained mechanics and isn‚Äôt a euro specialist, then the dealer is almost certainly a better option. 

Rebuilt transmissions‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure there are good rebuilt transmissions, but most of them, especially one that a non-specialist shop would install are not up to par to a transmission that Volkswagen, or a qualified actually competent aftermarket rebuilder (like you for example) would rebuild. These transmissions that are rebuilt poorly will almost certainly cause issues, shift wrong, slip, etc and will have to be replaced by a transmission that was rebuilt correctly and installed by a competent trained professional who knows what there doing, whether it be a specialist Indy shop or dealer, and yes there are dealers with brainless monkeys working at them, but atleast the dealers near me have competent overpriced service.

The 09G, is well as you have said definitely not a problem-less transmission, that valve body issue is not super common. If maintenance has been neglected than it‚Äôs a lot more likely that issue will appear, but as OP‚Äôs car has \*only\* 46,000 miles it is highly unlikely that the transmission is the issue in this scenario, as in my original comment, this transmission could survive being redlined, cold, everyday and not go bad at only 46k miles. Maybe if this car had more miles (90k?) it would be a lot more believable that this is a transmission issue but at only 46k, I don‚Äôt think so. side note: while I do like the way this transmission shifts in my Passat, most cars with the 09G have a different shift profile to the Passat and are pretty much written by a Minecraft engineer lol.",Volkswagen

"There is so much truth to this post. It makes me very sad as a life long Volkswagen enthusiast. My life was saved when my mk 5 Rabbit was t-boned by a 4Runner. My mk 6 GTI has been a phenomenal car. The mk 7.5 R I had feel apart in the two years I had it. While I don‚Äôt have anything against electrics, all of Volkswagen‚Äôs current offerings in the USA both electric and not are boring, mundane, poorly built computers on wheels with no souls. The ID. Buzz was going to be exciting. But it will cost far too much, have far too little range, and without the excitement of them not even considering to offer a camper option on it, it will be a flop. The Arteon was gorgeous, but a total flop. The Atlas, Jetta, Taos and Tiguan are all boring unreliable appliances with poor driving dynamics and even poorer build quality. 

It‚Äôs incredibly sad what has become of Volkswagen. I am hoping that this is all just from the poor planning and leadership from the Herbert Diess era, and that once the models that were all in the pipeline during that time have been replaced that things will be better in the Oliver Blume Era. He‚Äôs even said that Volkswagen as a brand is not competitive. Here‚Äôs hoping something happens. But as a result Hyundai and Genesis products have now become my top consideration.",Volkswagen

Or so you guys know another subreddit that is better to ask this?,Volkswagen
"Cause is poor manufacturing processes. Aisin saw a huge quality drop around 2k15 or so. The valve bodies are known to get fit and finish concerns. Most common issue is the selector valve bore going out of spec. Requires milling, and then re-sleeving back to spec. Sonnax is the place to source the re-sleeve kit. This issue can kill the transmission if not addressed quickly. What happens is all the fluid pressure bleeds off between the bore and the valve due to the imperfect tolerances. Since the selector valve is located on the main vein of the fluid feed, the rest of the unit starves for fluid. Will kill the clutches in no time.  Next common issue is the accumulator bore developing fissures. This happens on higher mileage examples. Same process. Requires milling, and then re-sleeve to spec and I also install a new piston. This one causes the annoying delayed engagement when shifting to D or R. Really annoying. You shift then slight pause, and then thump, into gear. Third common issue is the clutch control valve failures. It has 4 control valves. These are like plungers that are spring loaded. With time and heat cycles they start to stick. Cause all sorts of engagement and shifting issues. If one valve is stuck, you might as well do them all. On some earlier valve bodies the valves were insufficiently sized. The aftermarket sells oversized kits. These really improve the shift characteristics of the transmission, but it's an invasive process, and Aisin changed to bigger valves on later valve bodies which supersede the previous versions. Which brings me to my next point. These valve bodies used to cost a pretty penny, so rebuilding them was worth it. I would do them for 2k out the door. But they went down in price, where it's actually worth it to just get a new one and swap it in. Less down time, and for about the same money. Plus it comes with a warranty from Aisin. 

As far as preventive measures go? There ain't much, except don't drive the car üòÇ sadly, not a matter of if but when, and which generation your transmission is. Staying on top of fluid changes and what not will help keep the transmission clutches happy and healthy, but doesn't prevent valve body wear unfortunately. Important route to take is to pay attention to the symptoms and don't ignore them. Even something that happens once in a blue moon. It's NOT normal, it's NOT wear and tear. It's an underlining issue, that will grow and manifest into a bigger problem.",Volkswagen

Somewhere, someone though this was a good idea: ""Hey there's a fault somewhere, I guess just cut the engine without warning, no matter if the car is doing 100 miles per hour"". This is just ridiculous. It's dangerous and should never have been engineered this way.
