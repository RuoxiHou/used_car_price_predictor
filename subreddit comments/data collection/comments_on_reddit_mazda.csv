That shit is beautiful,mazda
Guy at my local dealership said it will be revealed in 2025.,mazda
Yes it is.,mazda
"Yea no problem - Cline Collision in Chambersburg

No affiliation, just a happy customer.",mazda
"Sorry to hear that, as some mentioned that this is the first gen product with either the new inline6, transmission and/or hybrid package and it's reasonable to expect some glitches. 

This is the same reason why some people prefer to wait a year or two after the new model is out to purchase it because by then, we'd all hope the majority of the glitches, if not all, should be figured out and fixed by then.

I waited a few years before I got my 9 as it was the first vehicle to get the turbo engine, so I waited to see how the powertrain package would hold up.

Again, I hope they could fix it quickly for you or provide you with a reasonable solution to your inconvenience.

All the best",mazda
I'm sorry I broke your heart,mazda
"Don't do that, then my daughter will want one.",mazda
"Yes stupid people are stupid apparently, monster what car they drive. Highest selling car in the world will do that I guess.",mazda
Short commute - I got lucky,mazda
"That’s a bit expensive in my opinion. Ask your friends for a recommendation on a trusted mechanic and look on yelp for one near you that has good reviews. 

Parts are a little over $200 before shipping and tax for the powerstop options from rockauto that someone else posted. You can probably get parts at a similar price from your local NAPA but that’s somewhat irrelevant since whatever mechanic you use will need to source the parts themselves to ensure they get the right parts and can warranty their work.",mazda
Are you a drug dealer?,mazda
"Just let insurance handle it, why are you trying to figure all that out on your own?",mazda
Wow. You should make better choices speaking to people.,mazda
There was a post about it being down for an update,mazda
"120 would make me apprehensive but that's not that much money, honestly and from what I've heard you could double that easy. Looks good but who knows. If you like it, go for it",mazda
"There are entire web pages, forums, and YouTube channels devoted exclusively to motor oil.",mazda
If it’s electric count me out Mazda sorry going German or Korean. Stinger GT2 or S5 Sportback.,mazda
Can't see!,mazda
"My screen eventually went about 5 years after I bought it. Mine actually kept beeping and hitting the scan button when I had it on radio like yours did. It’s like I was pressing with my finger in the bottom center of the screen when I wasn’t. Wonder if it’s a coincidence with that screen. I just had them replace it at the dealership, wasn’t about to trust myself to do it myself.",mazda
"Many people believe that 7500 miles is too long an interval. Basically every mechanic I have ever spoken too would say that's a bit optimistic. 2k miles is a bit excessive, but nothing wrong with that. I bet that vehicle will be extremely well maintained throughout this ownership and should provide a long and reliable service life.",mazda
i mean yes but its a small supermini and it's only one model!,mazda
Also no chrome or matte metallic sheen coatings. They look awful if they start to peel. and daily fingerprints ...,mazda
Wagon version please.,mazda
Yup I know about it. Like I said it's getting returned.,mazda
"Which is a fair point, though BMW is slowly losing itself in some of their recent cars. The M3 and M4 look atrocious in the front, M2 now weighs about the same as a Camaro or a Mustang(so you can't make fun of American ponies that much anymore), and the XM... Some things are the best if we pretend they don't exist.

But yeah, I would imagine a 3 series with its FR setup handling better than an FF Mazda. I just don't know if we will see an FR sedan from Mazda.",mazda
Have you considered just not accepting any form of payment that requires fees on your end? So probably just cash and debit?,mazda
"If they’re paying 3% it’s by choice or laziness. CC processing is very competitive. The credit surcharges are acceptable for businesses that do a high volume of low dollar transactions and/or are traditionally cash based. Convenience stores are a great example. Giving a discount for cash would be favorable in this case, like many gas stations.  Processing fees are a cost of doing business. Build them into your pricing.",mazda
"I own a 2023 carbon edition and a 2022 RAV4. I can tell you this the Mazda has a better interior. The Mazda is a little bit more fun to drive. The RAV4 has more cargo space and room. Both transmissions shift perfectly. The Mazda is direct injection prone to carbon buildup. The Mazda also has the useless cylinder deactivation which will cause problems down the road with your lifters. I've had many Toyotas over the years with not one single problem. This is my first Mazda, so we will see. I viewed the Mazda as a short term vehicle, and the Toyota as a long-term vehicle.",mazda
"The USB port in my center console hasn't worked in years, are any of these fuses responsible for that?",mazda
Seeing that red makes me want to change my mind about finding a black one. Looks amazing.,mazda
Fuck ya !!,mazda
"I guess people didn't like our comments lol😆😆 That's okay. Our dealership suffers because nobody buys Mazdas compared to Nissan, Toyota, Honda. Nissan and Toyota have a line wrapped around the building everyday. We're lucky if we work on 12 cars a day lolol",mazda
Nobody tell them it’s the phone.,mazda
"Of course everyone has their own opinion, but a test drive you only have the car for 30 minutes. I was just interested to hear the opinion of someone who has lived with it for some time…",mazda
Mazdaaaaamn,mazda
"No one will repaint the entire car for that damage.

Once you repaint any portion, it will never match perfectly but will be close enough that you just have to live with.

Even if the body shop were to paint the whole car, they will never be able to perfectly match the colors for metal and plastic parts. On top of this, you may end up getting dust here and there.",mazda
"Everyone SAYS they want wagons, but in the US, wagons don't sell in any numbers. That's why they don't bring them here.

With that said, I WANT A WAGON!!!",mazda
Yes it was roughly 90 degrees. I'm wondering if maybe it was modified slightly throughout the production run of the 2.5,mazda
"Look for awd test videos on YouTube. The off road mode is for slow controlled off road situations where you're traction limited or stuck.

Example, when you have one or two wheels in the air and no traction it will pulse the brakes to transfer torque to the tires with traction and it's not very smooth but will get you unstuck.",mazda
"Hmm, small selector next to the shifter…what could it be?!? What happens when you press it? Lol it’s not that complicated. Also read your manual.",mazda
"My first car was a Mitsubishi-built 1979 Plymouth Champ with a twin-stick transmission.  It was an absolute blast to drive, and I loved that car!  Sadly I only had it for two years as it got totaled in a parking lot by an idiot taxi cab driver.  But my other favorite car of that era was the Mitsubishi Cordia.  It’s depressing to see how far that company has fallen.",mazda
"Looks like the MSRP is way lower for a high trim level in Canada so I guess I’m waiting until November when I move. 

My little Jetta is gonna have to come up north with me at first but at least it’ll be cheap to import vs a brand new car.",mazda
"This may be a dumb question on my part

But last I checked the residual on the lease probably wouldn't show you the sales tax that needs to be paid on that residual.

I know mine didn't. But I guess that could vary by state, country. If there is even a sales tax on cars where you are to begin with.",mazda
"I'm still complaining, and I didn't even see your last pics...  That's all I got. I'm  out see ya.",mazda
"GenAI generally takes several seconds for every request and doesn't do a great job of answering questions with just yes/no - it wouldn't be helpful for the sort of question you're describing.

>pardon me for the stupid question. asking as a new user, why do people switch models? Is it like, some kind of power user technique?

This question alone is enough to demonstrate you're absolutely not in the AI field, lol. I can't even believe you're in software, honestly.

To answer your question though, it's *possible* but the cost, scandal, and legal risk of any automaker just streaming audio from your car means that there's 0% chance of any big-name manufacturer doing it.

What's more likely is that you were either talking to someone about this topic, and they Googled it - which resulted it in showing up to you. That or there's other behaviors that made this sort of ad more likely to show up - e.g. looking at running shoes might make you more likely to get ads for treadmills, and vice-versa - and you just noticed it because of something like the Baader-Meinhof effect.",mazda
Makes sense. Thanks. Was worried long term. But Im not flooring it while upshifting but more like keeping the speed so it doesnt lose revs,mazda
"Your deductible….

Stop asking these questions. Cars are too expensive today to not go thru insurance.",mazda
The CX-90 looks like the shipping crate this car came in.,mazda
"Oh for sure, there’s a long list of reasons lol",mazda
Yeah I guess I usually clean with a duster. I'm surprised it scratches that easily. Never noticed.,mazda
"Prob just the dealer. Oil changes arent expensive and are a pretty quick job, so I wouldnt put it passed them to offer just to make a sale. As long as they didnt say its free and then still charge you at some point, Id say its a win win because why not. That said its still dumb if they implied that was like a mazda corporate policy or something.",mazda
"Quite alot of car dealerships in the UK get around this buy absorbing the cost but limiting the amount you can pay on a credit card. When buying my Mazda I had more than enough on a credit card to cover it but they would only let me pay £2k on it, was such a pain.",mazda
This is why you don't buy a new car unless you can afford to get decent insurance.  sorry for your loss. At least $6000-7000 out of pocket at least.,mazda
"No brainer, if you don’t need the space",mazda
The real answer,mazda
I love the color.,mazda
για Skyactiv X είναι καλός κινητήρας?,mazda
"I'm curious if the 2025 CX-70 has better gearbox programming, that alone would fix a lot of issues people had with the 90.",mazda
"Holy moly, that feel expensive even in it were in my local currency, Chinese Yuan. You need to get the hell outta there. Especially with prices ending in .99",mazda
"Eww touch screen. Nothing . Like dirty fingerprints on screens, ans constantly leaning over. Lol",mazda
"I'm glad I gave you some food for thought.

Your feelings are valid but it's time to move forward.

Your car looks amazing, and you're going to have a great time driving it.",mazda
Infotainment software has to be 74.xx.xxx or higher btw. There are many YouTube vids on how to do this yourself (Mazda 2 is a little bit difficult to install the usb hub if you have the armrest. At least it was when I used to install these years ago).,mazda
">I hate that I spent 50k for a lemon that I don’t trust to transport my kids in.

This really sucks to hear, and I hope they make it right for you.",mazda
No joke but I think that car is one of the most beautiful cars currently,mazda
Mazda is positioning itself as a premium brand.  They're not interested in targeting the entry-level economy car market.,mazda
Mazda has the best reds in the game by a wide margin.,mazda
"You seem to have a difficult time understanding the difference between facts and opinions. Your eyes may be unable to distinguish between the CX-60 and CX-70. As you said, they ""look basically the same"". But to other people, the difference is big and they don't like what they see with CX-70. Sorry dude. We don't all love your dream car.",mazda
That's the PHEV version,mazda
"Have your battery tested. That code usually means the battery is on its way out. Battery warranty is 3 years, 36k miles.",mazda
I like it!,mazda
"Wonder if that’s new, a buddy of mine bought out his Honda lease directly from Honda financial in FL a couple years back.",mazda
"Type R > Mazda 3, though.",mazda
Good... I'm sick of having only the 3 and miata to choose from if I hate SUVs.,mazda
It could use a diet. Those are some big love handles.,mazda
"Thai, leg support seats.",mazda
"I mean, if you are *that* concerned, I know of no other way than just buying a used car before all those features were a thing.

I mentioned in another thread, but those software switches could all be placebos anyway, if you are really that concerned. Remember the Ashley Madison data leak. ""But I paid $19.95 to get my data deleted!"" Yeah, no.

I am not against new cars because I am currently driving an older one, but it's just a fact of life you have to accept, IMO. Sure, I can take some of these steps, but at the end of the day, it could just all be placebo switches and I will still sleep okay.",mazda
No parking?,mazda
Mazducci,mazda
I'm so pissed we don't get this in the States.,mazda
"Easy. I have a first gen 3 and miata so not apples but the miata goes every time as much as possible. If I could afford a newer one, especially a RF I'd drive it 100% of the time. You have to drive something why not drive something more fun?",mazda
You... know the CX70 is the exact same size of the CX90 right?,mazda
"https://images.app.goo.gl/TB3NAb7ue2QviiCK6

it looks something like this",mazda
"Go buy a Mercedes, maybe she'll like that. I can tell you one thing, live your life for you. Don't spend money to impress others. That's how a lot of people end up in huge debt keeping up with the Jones's. She's not your wife, or GF. She's not the one living with it. When u need to get somewhere none of that matters.",mazda
"it’s obvious you knew what i meant. it’s obvious it’s a front mid engine car. Please don’t ever compare a FWD car against a RWD car again. lol. The CX90
is big because it was designed to be big. The CX70 is coming which is smaller but with the same chassis setup and superior handling than any other Mazda offering besides the Miata of course. This will appease those concerned with the size of the CX90.",mazda
You’re lucky to live in a place where the CX60 is sold. It’s easily the best looking SUV Mazda’s ever made.,mazda
Do you mind sharing why? Is it because cx30 drives lighter and more like a car?,mazda
"I've also been debating these two, along with the CX5. Nothing is going to handle as well as a BMW but you get to the point where the question is, is the better handling worth the extra money for the driving you do 95% of the time?",mazda
A for effort. F for looks,mazda
"Gledas taj od 21k, a? Stoji na oglasima vec 6 meseci otp, ne moze da ga proda jer trazi previse",mazda
Do you ever drive when it's dark out? Because that will also increase your rates through most insurers using that data.,mazda
Lmao. That's so mean.,mazda
It could be the timing chain or the intake valve is now super dirty.,mazda
"Cool thank you. While you're here, anything specific I need to look out for on these motors. I'm at 195k miles and would like to keep it for the foreseeable future as I love the car and there isn't really anything like it on the market.",mazda
Repu is a cool truck. The battery is in the side of the bed and not in the engine bay,mazda
Whoa....,mazda
Don't bother. 100% chance you hit it again anyway.,mazda
Tell them to design a new mazda6 with the inline6 and benchmark the f80 m3.,mazda
Did the impact set off your ejection seat? Those are expensive if you have to repack the parachute.,mazda
Was kinda looking for more info... :(,mazda
"Depends on how well you want it done. Getting it looking brand new is probably $8-10,000.",mazda
"CX-30 for sure, better overall, more comfy with a better interior and more fun to drive, only get the CX-5 if you need a bit more room in the back seat. Prefer our Cx-30 over our family’s CX-5",mazda
Nope,mazda
Nice apartment.,mazda
"NEVER Valvoline for oil change service. They always overcharge, especially when you’re a girl/woman or uneducated about cars, which I am none of those. Valvoline oil change technicians are also one of the least handy or knowledgeable tech’s about cars because all they do is oil changes and nothing else",mazda
Okay nice. Yeah I do a lot of highway driving too but the roads here in Australia are pretty rough. I guess I’ll just need to see what it’s like. But that’s good to hear there’s no noticeable issue with the transmission over time. Thanks for the info ;),mazda
"Having driven both, and the Q5, nothing beats the CX-50 in driving dynamics, especially at the limit. With the other 2, especially the Q5, the steering is so numb, I literally have to guess at how much grip I have left, it's absurd.

The CX-50 is the closest SUV (or any modern vehicle) I've driven that had the same steering feel as my old Evo. Impressed us enough we bought 2 of them.

I take mine up to 110ish daily if not faster, depending on how empty the highway is on my early morning commute. There's a curved section of interstate that I don't even slow down for, it's like it's on rails at 110. It's rock solid up to about 120ish. Any idiot in any car can hit 100+. The difference is that I've done the same turn at 90+ in the rain and I can actually feel the grip changing in sections where the pavement changes.",mazda
Mazdaratti.,mazda
Nani,mazda
Matsuda?,mazda
"It is not possible to tell you “how much”. Each body shop has its own source of parts, the goal for you is to get the parts from a donor car. If lucky they can source this exact Mazda color, if unlucky the light assembly will come from Mazda and they will have to paint. I’d say somewhere from $4000 to $10,000",mazda
Right. And is the outback still a wagon? Its awful tall...,mazda
"Personally, I don’t think the GLC is worth the price tag. Some of these more “entry” level luxury cars are massively watered down as far as build quality and features but they charge a massive premium for the luxury badge. Is it worth the investment? Absolutely not. A higher trim Mazda will get you a superior product than a GLA/GLB/GLC at a lower price point. 

I think the real question is, how much is it worth to you to to be in a car with a luxury badge?",mazda
"A trainer for MNAO told me to expect a new generation CX-5 for the 2025 model year, to arrive towards the end of this year. No details",mazda
Only if it has a B58 engine,mazda
Dang that's pretty.,mazda
"The under body panel is two screws and two push tabs…… but i digress. If youre so cost conscious why are you having the dealer have anything done on the car? Also a cabin and air filter are scheduled items….. 25k miles.!.!.!.! If you like negotiating and talking to ppl on the phone is a fun pass time, i get it….. but everything you detailed seems like a lot of time, money and effort for no benefits.",mazda
"Yeah, they gonna develop an engine for your country specifically. That totally makes sense /s",mazda
"I can see it in the my mazda phone application and also in the car it shows up automatically if one of them is low, so i guess its possible to navigate to this screen in the car menu as well.
By the way im in Hungary/europe so maybe its different by location.",mazda
"If you scour the webs hard, you’d find the exact engine codes, that are basically confirmed to be problematic, and some are less. I wouldn’t really care who buys what but my friend personally went through the 2.2 hell so I actively remind people to think twice. The Sky-G engines are very good and efficient (if going the non-turbo route) so this is IMO the way. I am glad my bud didn’t curse the brand and went for another Mazda after this fiasco, and now he happily drives a 2.5 litre petrol 6 for couple years.",mazda
Alotnof little things i assumed yea,mazda
💀 bruh no way I meant cx-30 lol,mazda
"Those people aren't very bright. It's almost exactly the same looking except the lower part of the front end. Other than that, the shape/proportions, side profile, color scheme, etc is all EXACTLY the same. The only difference is 5 adults can be comfortable in the CX-70.",mazda
mum says we have an RX7 at home,mazda
I do usually keep the p5 on the street but had just moved them all out to do yard work and thought they looked nice all lined up before [stabling the newer ones.](https://imgur.com/a/mij1GHp),mazda
"We like it, thanks for sharing!",mazda
Good lord it looks wonderful,mazda
"This one has black interior with red stitching. I read something about there being a shortage with the red leather in 2021, so they also released these with black interiors.",mazda
"How I'd think about it : Do you have as much money to burn during your retirement? If you're unsure or the answer is ""no""  then I'd go for a more mainstream Japanese brand like Mazda for reliability reasons and because it costs a ton less to maintain and repair.",mazda
No recall. Just their 6 month service.,mazda
"Like others have said, the dial is actually much nicer than a touchscreen. Takes a while to get used to, but you'll see why other companies are switching back to analog controls rather than the touchscreen",mazda
"That sucks. Part of the reason I went with the 2024 CX-5 instead of waiting on the new generation of 2025 CX-5s. Never buy the first of a new generation of vehicles, no matter how reputable the manufacturer is, there will always be issues that need a couple years to completely resolve.",mazda
I agree 600 mile range would make it feasible for people who don’t have ready access to a charger.,mazda
Cup holders closer to the center console where I can reach them,mazda
I love the red interior on the Carbon editions. I saw a newer used one on the lot soon after I bought my used CX-9 Touring Plus and I almost considered trading it in for those red seats.,mazda
98 Mazda xedos 9  air intake placement to be precise its only the matter with 2.5L engine.,mazda
Mazjestic,mazda
"I’m still waiting for parts but my hood and bumper and grille needs to be replaced along with the headlight. $7000 CAD :( mines way worse though, the whole corner was damaged and cracked, you might be able to get away with just replacing the headlight for now",mazda
Mazda isn't considered luxury?,mazda
No touching! There should be no need to touch the cluster! Lol,mazda
"There’s sources that say they are indeed working on a CX-50 hybrid that would take exactly the same stuff from the RAV4 hybrid, and there are also rumors of possibly an electric Mazda 6(e) in the coming years! A patent was made in Europe for it recently!!",mazda
My last two Mazda leases were through Toyota. https://pressroom.toyota.com/mazda-north-american-operations-renews-agreement-for-toyota-motor-credit-corporation-to-provide-private-label-financing-under-the-mazda-financial-services-brand-name/,mazda
"This. Glossy panel look great before you touch it .It is the evidence that manufacturers don’t care about your experience with the car, they just care about you buying it.",mazda
"I'd rather shove my dick in a toaster than drive a Ford pickup, but maybe I'm just a grumpy Mazda fanboy.",mazda
"Looks like a damaged transformer.

But is it an Autobot or a Decepticon?",mazda
"You don't have to drive like an asshole to have your insurance rates go up. They are measuring hard acceleration, hard braking, and speeding. However, they don't define what they consider hard acceleration or braking. They also don't know why you are doing those things. Maybe you're merging into the highway or passing a truck on the highway. With require short term ""hard"" acceleration, but are not unsafe. Maybe you hit your brakes hard to avoid a car that cuts you off. All of these innocuous actions can be used to raise your insurance rates.",mazda
Hi mate. It's got 44k on the clock. Original clutch yes. The noise is very feint,mazda
How does the space and ride compare? We were thinking about getting my wife a cx50 and we previously had a cx9,mazda
"Toyota and Lexus by me in South FL just did the same
Thing starting April 1st. I’ll find some where else to take my business.",mazda
You agreed to a price that included an oil change.  Service department needs to do the work that was requested.,mazda
"Greek guy here, i pay in germany for my mazda6 2l engine with 165hp 98€/y car tax 😅 But insurance is expensive here mate if you compare it to greece ..",mazda

You get the idea",mazda
That’s gonna be my upgrade whenever our family grows! And that color is just beautiful!,mazda
"But that distinction matters, no? Businesses figured out ages ago they can increase prices AND charge fees, then over the years increase both. Wording matters, and this plays into that.",mazda
Lovely Simply lovely 😍,mazda
It’s because you searched for it. If you’re in the US companies don’t need permission to track you. Use a VPN for an EU country and you will see all of the trackers they put on us without our consent.,mazda
"Nice. Me too. They still make my head turn and I seriously contemplated getting either the sedan or wagon in the anniversary spec. I’ve already had a 2013 Twin turbo Diesel sedan but sold that nearly 6 years ago. 

I hope you enjoy it. It’ll turn heads for sure.",mazda
"At least a few grand so be ready for it. And if you ever get a new car, think about adding solid coverage on it for at least the first couple years in case of something like this.",mazda
"The CX-90 is similar inside to a standard Toyota Highlander (not the Grand Highlander). If all the seats are up, there isn't much room in the back. If you're wanting to put child seats in the third row, I think you'd be better off with the larger competition",mazda
"🤣 hahahah okay bud. Well to paraphrase you, maybe if you work real hard you can own a house with all four walls and a garage that doesn't doublestack. You came in *real freaking cocky about your station* for someone who lives in a \*ahem\* townhouse with a garage the size of stamp.",mazda
Looks like the Terminator.,mazda
"Mazda 3 vs model 3, cx5 vs model y, cx9 vs model X right? I cross shopped Mazda 3 and cx5 with Tesla’s for sure. Second hand model 3s offered insane value.",mazda
It was a really hard decision but I needed to have a higher sitting vehicle to feel safe during our Texas storms and flooded roads. I still have my Mustang so I didn't completely ditch it. Hopefully I can eventually afford to fix it up. I had to replace the transmission at about 80k. Feeling like it's slightly slipping again also. I also just dumped 2k into fixing the A/C.,mazda
"It’s not a big deal, she just doesn’t like it.

And if you like it, fuck em. They don’t have to drive it, you do.

Own up to it too; I’d probably say something like “Yeah, I love my grandma car. It’s great.”",mazda
I had my first two oil changes done at the dealership since I couldn't do them myself. Now that I have a garage I did the first one myself last month. Crawled under my Mazda3 only to realize the oil access panel is missing along with the screws and push pins. Can't trust a stealership to do anything right (besides taking your money).,mazda
"Amati 

This is the actual answer.",mazda
I was lucky enough to find a local shop competent and patient enough to get it right. I’ve used them twice now and am absolutely thrilled with the work they did (southern PA),mazda
Or at least make it harder to accidentally hit the buttons. I accidentally hit the panic button or trunk release about once a month walking around the house with the key in my pocket.,mazda

"BMW warranty is better by a mile, I think 1-2 years or about 15000 miles on top of the Mazda warranty. BMW also throws in free maintenance/service for 4 years. Pretty neat, but from my experience with my 2018 Mazda3, not much maintenance is needed to begin with and zero issues over the last 7 years.",mazda
"Please do not do this. They will give Mazda the auto decline on your warranty, and no, oil changes shouldn't go that long between. 
Currently, the app is trash, do not use the app as a reference for that. Use the details within the car settings (if it was programmed) or do they place a sticker on your windshield?",mazda
Pure sex. I hate living in America for the simple fact that I can’t have one of these.,mazda
"I’m right there with you. I’m going on 2 weeks with my CPO 23 carbon. I have never had such a vehicle “standout”. I liked simple. My previous cars have been white or black with all black interior. Plain Jane but simple to keep clean. I liked that aspect of them ya know? 

I’ve been wanting more room for camping gear and what not but also did not want a huge SUV or truck. Mazda fit perfectly. A little ride height, a lil more leg room.. everything I wanted. HOWEVER, I initially wanted the CX50. I loved how it looked more aggressive. Well, the only one I could find that was decently priced and maintained was way out of my price range. I hadn’t even considered the 30. It always looked “snouty” to me. The front end seemed too sharp. But of course, this was after the sad dealing of the 50. But then I saw a carbon. I liked the sporty black wheels & the blueish grey tone color. And then I opened the door. “Red.. and not even red red” is what I thought. It felt tacky. Not actual texture but appearance. I didn’t even want to drive it. But my good buddy that was with me kept raving about how it looked. I caved and decided to take her for a spin. Drove like a dream. Started loving all the features it had. And slowly I kept telling myself “I actually like the seats aren’t bright red”, “reminds me of wine”.

"It could definitely be the alternator going bad... Check/confirm that both drive belts are in contact and spinning.   

It could also be a dirty throttle body, sticking will cause it to want to stall.

Easy to clean with a can of intake cleaner, a toothbrush, and some patience. (Or, do what I do and pull it off the intake and clean it on the bench.)

If it's the direct injected Skyactiv engine like in mine, it could need the intake valves cleaned.  This is a more involved process, but it does make a big difference.  I first cleaned mine at 155,000 miles.  They were pretty crusty at that point.  The big downside of Direct Injection engines is that there is no fuel washing the back of the intake valves. (Toyota adds a port fuel injector which mitigates this issue and I wish Mazda would too.)

If its NOT the Skyactiv, it could be a bunch of other things.  Is it throwing any codes?  (Check Engine light on?)

I most definitely would not pay 0 mile new prices on a car with 9k miles and an accident, I’m thinking 15k-17k  and I would consider talking.

"What's the year? And do you have service records for it? A well maintained Mazda3 from the third or fourth generation (with Skyactiv motors) can be a 200-300k mile car. My 2014 has 160k, owned from new, and it's been nearly flawless not counting a failed rear brake caliper at 90k and a failed belt tensioner pulley at 140k or so. But I've done every maintenance item Mazda recommends exactly on time, plus a few they don't (transmission fluid exchanges at 60k and 120k). 

On any car over 100k miles, the question of how well it was maintained rises to much more importance than ""how reliable was this car when it was a new model?""  Most importantly, did the original owner(s) change the engine oil at least every 7500 miles? 

If you can't know this, you need to assume it was not well maintained. Owners who maintain their cars well typically keep the paperwork and can show it to you in a private sale. If it's a dealer, most cars will show some (not all) maintenance history on their CarFax. But either way, you should get a prepurchase inspection done if you aren't mechanically skilled yourself. It will be the best $200 you ever spend and you'll know what needs to be done.

Many many people sell cars at around 100k because that's a major maintenance interval. If the following things haven't been done at or around 100k you should budget for doing them -- several thousand dollars if you can't do it yourself: coolant flush, transmission drain and fill, brake fluid flush, serpentine belts and likely tensioner pulley (if a 2013-17, you should replace the OEM pulley with the belts the first time you do them, it will fail before 200k), spark plugs, throttle body and intake cleaning, likely rear shocks and front struts, and possibly other front end hardware depending on how hard it was beaten on, and the usual oil, air filter, etc. 

Facing a $2000+ round of maintenance costs, many people decide ""fuck that"" and sell cars in very good shape at 100-120k (just so they can spend much more on a brand new car's depreciation, people are dumb). 

But that means buyers of cars nearing or recently past 100k should anticipate needing to do this stuff to get another 100k miles out of them, and budget (and negotiate price) accordingly. A person selling a 100k mile car is likely not to have done all the major maintenance needed at that mileage, whereas those of us who keep cars until the wheels fall off are sticklers for scheduled maintenance!

The other thing to check very carefully is for structural rust. Modern era (2013- ) Mazdas have fewer issues with rust than the older ones, but it is one thing that will shorten the life of a car by a lot if it's out of control. And don't assume it isn't an issue because you live in a place without winter conditions -- unless you're buying from a local private seller who's owned the car since new. Used cars travel all over the country these days. Again, your best bet is having a professional mechanic *you're paying* give the whole car a hard look on a lift and with an OBD scanner and tools for a compression test.  And any seller who won't allow you to do that can't be trusted anyway.

And just one more thought: if you're trying to save money and get a reliable car with over 100k miles, the last thing you want to care about is higher-trim ""features."" That's more stuff to break on an older car. 

Well maintained matters way more than higher trim level features. The features are nice to have, and so is pretty paint, but what's under the surface -- the drivetrain, the front end, the structural metal bones of the car -- matter much much more to your getting a good deal.",mazda

"Change from a reliable ice vehicle to a car with a lithium ion battery pack that no matter what you do, will degrade and cost over $10k to replace. 

I don’t know what was so confusing about that. I just switched back to ice after my experience with phev, and won’t be back until solid state batteries are mass produced for the consumer market.

“Emissions!” Lithium strip mining and the manufacturing of the battery itself induces enough emissions where the car won’t be carbon neutral until year 5 (the vast majority of electricity in the us is still coal fired power plants) and cell degradation is all but guaranteed by year 10.

I’m obviously not against ev (I just traded in a phev) but I think it’s being pushed too hard with not enough effort put into mitigating costs of ownership or environmental impact.

Anyhow, both models are good vehicles. I prefer the CX5 myself just because it has larger front seats.

My advice is to try and find a dealer who doesn't play games with fees and financing. In my Markey (Chicagoland), I can get a 2021 CX5 touring for about $24k +++ or a grand touring for about $26k +++.

My recommendation is to scour cars.com, cargurus.com, autotrader, and local dealership websites for used Mazdas. Compile the info like miles, trim, price, vin, and stock number. This will give you a good idea of where your local market is priced. Use those figures to negotiate a fair price. 

Try to avoid unnecessary fees. Check out The Homework Guy on YouTube for advice on the car buying process.

Very great fuel consumption 4-5l/100km

"It’s because they pay fees on the back end for credit card purchases, and they decided to pass them on rather than absorb them.",mazda
"It also ignores the costs associated with cash. Cash is easier to make a mistake counting/making change, theft, misplace, damage, also the added time in truing up cash on hand with your books, trouble of keeping the right denominations on hand, having to do bank runs if you don't pay for a service to exchange/deposit/withdraw, etc. ""Just passing along"" the processing fee is just another excuse to charge even higher prices than what is listed elsewhere.",mazda
"Tesla has some obnoxiously deceptive extra fees.  We stopped taking tesla's in on trade in for this reason because they are rough to sell 2nd hand.  Imagine negotiating a used car deal on a used tesla, then finding out tesla wanted another 10k for themselves to activate all the proprietary software that runs the car in the 2nd hand owners name.  I'd avoid ev cars like the plague.",mazda
"The rule is the merchant (dealer in this case) can’t be making money from charging the fee. But their processor is taking the difference so it is legal. Visa capped the surcharge limit at 3%, if it’s more you can report them. They are not allowed to charge a fee for debit cards. ",mazda

It’s very good. But I feel it’s too complex. Less is more. The 3s deign philosophy revolved around simplicity. Kodo I think they called it. Simplify the body panels so they look like they “fit” in. For example the splitter and the graphics such as the vents for air curtains. I am not a 3d designer at all but I used to be an automotive design enthusiast. I mostly stuck to sketches on photoshop and never done 3d work. But I know it’s not easy so I do have to commend you on the effort.,mazda

"I mean, used and new comparison aside(it's always a bit unfair), the used BEV being cheaper is great for *current* buyers, but imagine if you are the guy who bought it new, especially a year or two back. It would take forever for you to offset the depreciation. My colleague, for example, lost CAN$34k in a year and half and 20k km on his Model Y. That's not much below the out-of-door price of a basic CX-5 GX here, for reference. Pretty hard regret from my colleague. Meanwhile, a loaded CX-5 would have lost maybe CAN$10k in value, plus CAN$4\~5k in gas and maintenance(two oil changes or so) in the same time period.

And don't forget insurance. If insurance companies have to total BEVs due to dents in the batteries(which has happened in Canada a few times), they are gonna jack the insurance rates up, naturally. Even if the dented battery pack might be fine, no one is willing to take the liability risk in the off-chance it isn't fine. And remember, when batteries do catch fire, there is no putting it out. Insurance companies don't tend to like that, either.

What is safer with Tesla? Both CX-5 and Model Y do well in IIHS tests, and if you are talking about the Autopilot, there is no shortage of videos of it messing up, and CX-5 still has enough nannies to keep you safe. I have also already covered the BEV fire points. Maybe Sentry Mode? But security would be a more appropriate word here.

I honestly wouldn't choose a Tesla because of the build quality and the non-zero possibility of Elon running it into the ground, then you are left with a car with zero support and resale value. Again, will cross that bridge if I get there, but right now I think e-Golf, Leaf, or even MX-30 are good for city commuting if I have a garage. Longer trips? I'm taking a manual trans ICE fun car.",mazda
"“Best” for whom?! So you’re going to overpay for half-assed oil changes on your Mazda for 5-years/60,000 miles for the powertrain warranty?!

I took my first Mazda to the dealership for its first oil change ONLY because it was free. HUGE mistake. It took them over two hours and the next day I checked under the car to find that two underbody fasteners were missing. I complained asking the dealership to replace the missing fasteners. They refused. My cars have never been back to the dealership since. I do everything myself and so haven’t lost/broken/forgotten a fastener yet.

"The middle rear seatbelt flaps constantly against the leather seat when driving with the windows down. I have to tuck it into the center armrest to stop it.

The area around the HUD needs some felt or something to prevent it from reflection so much onto the windshield. This does not happen often but when it does it's annoying.

The sensor for the rearview auto dimming isn't sensitive enough. Or having the rear windshield tinted is causing the problem. Maybe some manual button I could press to turn on the dimming feature. Would be awesome if it turned on the side mirror dimming too.

Thanks for asking.

In theory a “last year” vehicle is going to have all the bugs worked out of it versus a first year refresh has potential for issues with the new design (see CX-90). I’m pretty confident I’ll be getting a 2024 Cx-5 precisely because it’s due for a refresh. 🤷‍♂️,mazda
I literally make car reviews and have been in many luxury cars. Mazda is definitely close to luxury brands. They just need to be quieter and a bit more smooth to be on luxury level,mazda
It's basically an automatic with the torque converter replaced by an electric motor powered by the hybrid battery. It's very similar to the skyactiv transimission in design actually.,mazda

"Well that car was is one of two things; it’s either a brush or touch-less and neither are great for your paint. Let’s start with brushes, avoid that shit like the plague it will ruin your paint with scratches and swirls, unless you don’t care about that then I urge you to re-evaluate your priorities in what’s probably the second largest expense in your life. 

Now touch-less seems great right? No swirls and scratches. What’s the issue? Well here’s what happens, your paint is pelted with high pressure reused water that probably has a ton of grit on it followed by a highly acidic soap, more water, and then a highly basic chemical to balance out the acidic wash that was just sprayed on your car. What this does is shock the paint, which is better than having it beat to hell by nylon brushes but it’s still not great. Over time this will cause issues with your paint.",mazda

She knew how you felt about your car and she felt as if she may no longer be getting the same attention, so she had to try and hurt your feeling in order to make herself feel better. This is the personality trait of an insecure female. Delete her from your phone. You do not need people like this in your life. If she was a real friend, she would tell you how awesome she thinks your car is because she knows how it makes you feel. She should want to make you happy regardless of her true feelings.",mazda
"Moreover, painting the whole car will drop its resale value *tremendously.* Because as far as the used market is concerned, that is a car that got hit in every direction—got misused on every panel.

"A few car brands (from memory GM, Hyundai and others- not sure,  google it to confirm) have apps that sell  data about you and how you drive onto insurance brokers. Apps might be opt in, but people often don't know what they are opting in for.

Some people have been denied insurance because insurance companies buy the data and decide that their driving was too risky (e.g. fast breaking, fast acceleration). People didn't realise that the car/ app was taking this data and selling it.

Some car companies are making alot of money from selling this data. So instead of being a customer who buys a car, you become a product.

I don't recall Mazda being part of this, but if they collect your data they can sell it later on with a sneaky change of service agreement.",mazda
"It’s not the month, specifically, it’s just the timing. For whatever reason they wanted to sell a bunch of cx5s, maybe they thought the market was drying up for the cx5 and they needed to purge some inventory. 

Combine the luck with the fact that federal interest rates are taking a bit longer than expected 6 months ago to start dropping so it looks like higher APRs are staying a bit longer for now.",mazda
I meant that’s not that much mileage considering the car’s lasted almost 20 years,mazda
Get the front lower control arm bushing dust covers installed while you can. They can make a weird clunk noise while turning at slow speed. If a mechanic is unaware of the bulletin for it they will be chasing the sound for days and swear on their grave it's coming from the sway bar mounts.,mazda
MazdA,mazda
"I know it's hard with safety and crash standards, but skinnier A, B and C pillars would be nice",mazda
"Fair point! But I think the concern here is that Mazda has been somewhat opaque about it collecting data and how it is directly tied to you and can negatively impact you. Driving at night becomes a negative input to your insurance profile. Hard braking because a kid ran in front of the car becomes a negative input. Not driving far enough can negatively impact your warranty. Driving too much impacts your insurance risk again. All of this isn’t a win for us consumers, but helps marketers, insurance and other business make money.

When you install an app, it usually asks for permissions to your mic, camera, gps, and you can make an informed decision about what it needs. The data is often are used to advertise and profile you, but not with such a poor balance in benefits for the app and user. 

For example, use google maps and you’re sharing your location so Google can gauge traffic (and perhaps see that you have a daily fast food habit). On the iPhone, you can have it set to only share while the app is open, so there is a mutual benefit, Google gets some data, I get traffic and routing. What do we get from Mazda selling your behaviors besides a potential flogging? What’s the upside?",mazda
"It’s really really tough to put my two year old into his car seat without banging his head on the sloping downward rear door frame. 

Heated steering wheel needs to be available as an option with the MT.

I can’t get the damn sidebar to go away on the navigation screen and it makes me so sad to not be able to take advantage of the full screen when navigating. Also why does the reverse camera not take up the whole screen? Add some pixels please.",mazda
"I've had both, they drive the same.",mazda
"At the shitty place I used to work, cash discount meant easy tax evasion, and no discount to the customer.",mazda

Was just comparing that its pretty terrible doing in MT that it might also as well be in AT but glad to know for sure,mazda
What about it???? Its the same sound of my cx5. Ive been driving it for 4 years no problem. They don't sound like mustangs for sure.,mazda
Also I took a picture. This is with where I had my front seat and I sit very far back as I’m 6’1 eith long legs and this is how much room I still had in the back.

"Honestly, these marginal trim differences have become so crazy that I can't keep track of them anymore. From what I remember - Turbo Trim N is equivalent to Turbo S Trim N-1, if that makes sense. Plus the power diff.",mazda
"It's your phone and the car. The phone connects to the car’s system and uses that in addition to its own microphone. You inadvertently agree to this when you purchase the car and there are ways to opt out. But know everything picks up on you for advertising purposes.

Also, someone mentioned someone else was nearby with the same interests; very possible as well.

If you’ve also got linked accounts at the office and at home, of course all the advertising data from your email transfers over on your phone, work and home devices.

It’s marketing; it sucks.",mazda
Tens of millions a year is not small by any stretch.,mazda
Did you say 6k down? Never put down on a lease.,mazda
you think they would bring this to the US as a new cx5?,mazda
"Nope, they're expensive here too. About $160 so very similar.

Tires are one of those things in life where it's worth spending for the best. They are the single most important safety feature on your vehicle, bar none, and make the difference between fun and confident driving and just driving. Tires will last most people 3-5 years, so an extra couple hundred bucks up front works out to a minor cost.",mazda
In Europe for example a lot of the VAG cars are 1.2&1.5L turbo engines. In common every day cars usually just some diesels are 2.0 or bigger. The mazdas 2.0 and 2.5 naturally aspirated petrol engines are a quirk.,mazda
Thank you so much I'll have a look!,mazda
Cool. Yeah thats the next idea is the swap. I saw somewhere where people were swapping a ford focus engine? I dunno. Overall Im all about diy fix&repair before I replace a vehicle.,mazda
"Why can’t someone design a decent 3rd row without weird flaws? 

The CX-90 for as new as it is has air vents by your knees, and chair rails that can probably only fit size 6 shoes. It’s even made worse if you have the center console. And there’s an odd small by the outermost foot that would be great if your foot could go there. 

Bigger cup holders throughout wouldn’t hurt either. Just better storage compartments would benefit greatly. It’s like no one tested how an actual person would use this space.",mazda
Sheesh,mazda

The 24s had wireless CarPlay which wasn’t in the 23s; that was the only notable difference I remember from when I was shopping. Would have been nice but wasn’t worth the ~$2500 difference. ,mazda
"So there's probably not rust underneath, right?",mazda
That's a good problem to have!,mazda
Eunos I guess,mazda
Pretty cuv 🙃 I got the hatchback,mazda
"I have been to enough Autocross and track events to have an idea of how throttle control works, so there is that.

Now, on a 400+ BHP RWD car with LSD, I get that you have to show restraint because it's pretty easy to Mustang it into wall, or worse. On a 250-ish BHP FWD car, it just feels silly to have to show similar levels of restraint, especially considering you have to pay extra for that power, just for it to be pretty useless in the city. Again, personally, if I am already willing to pay extra for a more powerful engine, tacking on another grand for an LSD is nothing.

Rolling start barely helps. I don't launch my cars in daily driving, I am talking about flooring it after it's already rolling. It happened with both cars I talked about.

And again, the puzzling part is that the NA 2.5 version and I believe the diesel variant of Mazda6 in Australia can have AWD. It's the most powerful 2.5T version that doesn't. Same thing with Camries in North America, where the 2.5 can be paired with AWD, but the 3.5? Nope. Why?

BTW, it's not just me. My buddy who owned that 2.5T Mazda6 asked me on a regular basis how to reduce the wheel slip. I pretty much just have to tell him that it is what it is.",mazda
That is the oil control valve. The gasket leaks and causes the valve cover to become saturated. Some mild blow by can occur at that point with no harm done. That being said if the valve cover comes off for any reason a good time to change it.,mazda
Those look slick! Might have to try them on my 2022 😂,mazda
Clean,mazda
"Thanks haha. I did study music and a minor in audio engineering but I am currently working as a software engineer.

In the thread I linked to, somebody mentioned a thread on a Mazda (non-reddit) forum. He mentioned he replaced the drive shaft propeller(?) and it did reduce the noise. I hope it’s not the actual problem as that does sound expensive. Anyway, thanks for stopping by!",mazda
I've only ever heard it in that scenario. Seems I've made a mistake.,mazda
i have a mazda 3,mazda
You know you can clip in the rear seat belts when not in use right? Lol.,mazda
Low mileage use requires an oil change at a much shorter interval as it’s the definition of extreme use. The engine isn’t getting hot enough to boil the contaminants off so your internal should be half the standard or less.,mazda
Mooz,mazda
"doesn't seem to be a issue with the 2013, mines pretty high mile and California dash is flawless",mazda
Oh man I am looking to buy a new car in the next couple of weeks and this one was on the top of my list! Thanks for the info! Will definitely be bringing this post to the dealership with me for my test drive,mazda
"If you really did overfill by 3 or 4 liters then it's likely the rods were dipping into the oil at the bottom of stroke and whipping the oil into a foam while driving it that three hours. The oil pump can't move foam so the crankshaft and rod bearings start to run dry, then overheat and melt. 

It also makes sense that it would come to a grinding halt when going downhill if the oil pickup came completely out of whatever liquid oil there was in the bottom of the pan and was left with only foam to try and feed the bearings.

If that's the case the damage is done, not much you can do. It may last a while still until a bearing spins and blocks oil flow completely, or it might be toast already. Good luck and start looking for a low-miles salvage engine if you really like the car otherwise.",mazda
It looks like some kind of coating from the bottom for the corrosion. Is it possible?,mazda

More rust proofing and thicker paint,mazda
"After debating getting a midsize SUV after having a baby, decided i'm gonna stick my wife with a crossover (maybe cx5) for fam trips and get myself a new lexus sports sedan in a few years.",mazda
"As much as I like my Mazda, I disagree that it’s the equivalent of a proper luxury brand.  There’s a night and day difference between a Toyota and a Lexus.  The price between those two doesn’t necessarily reflect the difference in value but there’s also economy of scale to factor in.  And at the end of the day, mazda still leans towards the economy side of the scale more than the luxury side.",mazda
But you can. Lots of business charge a set amount of let’s say $3.95 for card payments from $5-500,mazda

"I hate slipping tires with a burning passion. If I press the gas pedal, I want my car to move forward, not have the tires screech like whiny children.

Now on an RWD car, I could forgive it a little because RWD burnout looks cool, but FWD one-wheel peel? Miss me with that crap.",mazda
"But how many freedom units is that? 

Seriously though, I have a MK4 golf GTI and I can barely get 500km out of a tank… though, that might be indicative of my driving style :)",mazda
I would kill for a white one in the states,mazda
"Tbh doubling down on it might change their opinion. I would always praise my miata after getting made fun of for it, but when the day came that I got a second car, everyone panicked because they thought I sold it. Over time, they grew to love it. They get happy whenever they see me drive it now.",mazda
"The common step is to swap the coil on cylinder two to another cylinder and check if the code moves to that cylinder. If it does, the coil is the problem. Something similar can be done for the spark plug if the coil isn't the problem.",mazda

"On the contrary (or to clarify), I heard dealership warranties don’t transfer, but manufacturer warranties for brand new cars transfer. That’s why a certified pre-owned warranty would run from the time the brand new manufacturer warranty ends, not from the time the car is originally bought brand new (unless it’s the CPO Powertrain warranty). But oftentimes, the powertrain warranty can be voided for lack of maintenance, but I don’t think the comprehensive 3-year/36k-mile warranty would.",mazda

Did you notice the reduced man-spread?  I test drove the 90 and when I switched to the cx50 afterwards it was immediately apparent.  The cx90 has wider armrests that limit the man spread.,mazda
"Thank you, hard to believe that’s clogged or bad at 15k miles but I’m no Mechanic",mazda

I'm stating the facts. People here have some hate boner for the CX-70. The CX-60 and CX-70 look basically the same and have the same shape/profile. Liking the look of one and not the other is dumb.,mazda
"It's okay, thank god. I would've cried lmao. I just got this 2020 two years ago.",mazda
Skyactiv *X* is 2.0 only. Is there a reason you’re partial to the X over the G? The 1.5L engine is pretty impressive for what it is. Very reliable and efficient. A slightly uptuned version made it into the first gen ND Miata as well.,mazda
Would love to see the skyactiv x engine in a other model that's not the cx30. I heard that the mx5 would get it but hasn't happened yet. I hope mazda goes the phev route with the 6,mazda

"Pretty sure in The Netherlands they only take weight/fuel/location into account. And the CO2 output but most regular gasoline or m-hybrids don't get below 50gr/km so they all get put in the same bracket in terms of CO2 output. So a 1.6L, 2.0L or 3.5L doesn't make any difference if I recall correctly.",mazda
"I'm sure a new one will still last 15+ years like most other new cars. To be honest the thing I worry about with new cars now is the ""smart"" features. Touch screens controlling too many things that could fail.. Apps that lose support or change what you can do post purchase. Things like that. Or the stupid subscription features I heard so much about.

Kind of unavoidable at this point huh? I feel like you'll lose a lot more before rust takes out a vehicle now lol",mazda

V6 so not the most powerful but had some go when romped on. This is why I only wanted the turbo. I still wanted the power when I stepped on it.

"Previous-generation hatches are gorgeous in every color offered, IMO, and manuals should be available on the used market in more trim lines.  Maybe look at those?  If you fancy a road/sea trip, you may be able to get a manual in a lower trim line in Puerto Rico and then drive it to a ferry and then back to the mainland for an extra $1k.  The car should be completely legal and serviceable in the US, but check into that.  Some folks did this to get a new Mazda 2 after they were discontinued in the US market.  Bonus: You'd have a unique vehicle in your city.

I have a 21 year old Mazda hatch (Protege5), and I will replace it with a Mazda 3 hatch, but then I rather like the bulbous style of the new 3 models.  I was wary at first, but it grew on me.  :-)  Also note that the hatch models should still be made in Japan, not Mexico or the US, and will be of higher quality as a result.  Hatches are also a LOT more practical than a sedan as you likely already know.",mazda

"1.  CX-50 needs 40-20-40 rear folding seat. Especially if you want to compete with Outback.  Four people ought to be able to ride with their skis to the trail or hill.

2.  Get rid of the stitched seam running up the middle of the leather seats.

3.  Provide recovery hooks, or at least places to attach them, front and rear. They can double as tie downs for rooftop loads.  Standard on Meridian, optional for others.  This would add credibility to Meridian's off-road positioning.

4. Raise rear trailer hitch receiver and electric connector, incorporating them into rear bumper fascia, improving departure angle.  Even Ford Escape does this.  Current implementation sits too low, scrapes driveways, looks like an afterthought.",mazda
"Yep, SkyDrive is programmed to protect itself in all situations. Yes if you turn TCS off using the button it'll disable the auto-upshift when pushing the accelerator past the kickdown pedal, but it is 100% in control of its own clutches.

You'll get used to the wheel/joystick screen controls in no time. Only problems I had with my 2020 was that the sun at certain angles (like sunrise/sunset) would cause the sensors to think there was a vehicle in front of it at low speeds and it engaged the auto brake feature. This only happened I think three times in the two and a half years I had it.

There should be no other fees, add-ons, BS dealer mark ups, reconditioning costs, or other nonsense. It’s the residual, plus some taxes if applicable, and title work. The warranty is something for you to negotiate separately.",mazda

"I drive a 2017 Subaru Outback base model with the 4 cylinder. (I follow this page because I'm also into Mazda's) I joined a Subaru enthusiast group on Facebook and every other comment was how the 4 cylinder was a slow laggy piece of shit and that a turbo or the 6 cylinder was the way to go. It made me feel insecure about my car because I too don't really enjoy buying cars and going ""cool I have thousands of dollars in debt"" and to top it off I'm in debt to a slow piece of shit? Wtf was I thinking? And all my other friends said I'm an idiot for getting a CVT!


So I left the page, and through driving the car in a city and just not thinking about other people's opinions I learned that the 4 cylinder is good enough. It gets to high way speeds quick enough, if you don't drive like a dip shit and floor it everywhere you go the CVT is fine. I get better gas mileage than my last car and I get to put the cheapest fuel in it.

"Fossil fuel is actually pretty tame compared to lithium-ion batteries, since there is pretty much no putting out lithium-ion battery fires. That stuff burns way hotter than gasoline can ever hope to burn, and there is no stopping it. Fossil fuels are combustible, but once you cut off the oxygen supply, it's actually pretty safe. Batteries come with their own oxidizer, so there is no cutting off the oxygen supply.

This is actually one reason that I doubt batteries can get better. The more energy-dense they are, the more unstable they become and they create bigger fireballs. Simple physics.

Elon has famously sold a ton of Tesla stocks to buy Twitter(now X), of all things. At least X is making Elon some great money... Oh wait. Then there is the fact that other manufacturers are starting to catch up, and they have ICE systems to fall back on if the wind changes direction(Ford, GM and Mercedes all stepped back on their full-EV plans). The risk is still there, much greater than other manufacturers.

(On a side note, you can keep your stock in a company even after you are kicked off the board. That's how Elon got rich from PayPal in the first place. So even if he is kicked off the board, there is still that risk he could just dump them.)

Cars can be perfectly safe after a minor accident and still be written off. Again, it boils down to liability, and the battery fire issue is not something insurance companies want to mess around with. It's cheaper and safer for insurance to write off cars with minor battery damage than to deal with a lawsuit down the road.",mazda

"> CC processing is a cost of being in business

Only because we've treated it that way for a long time. CC processing is actually the cost of using a credit card. Only charging it to the people who incur that cost makes more sense in terms of aligning economic incentives. Part of the reason the transaction fees are so high is that we pretend the fees don't really exist by hiding them in the price. If people are confronted with true cost they will use cards less which will create an incentive to lower the fees until people find the fee to be reasonable. Right now we're all just sending a 3% tariff on massive amounts of economic activity to these leeches for a service that should be a fraction of the current cost.",mazda

In my last 3 Mazdas (protege 5, Mazda 2, CX3) the cup holder is tucked between the front seats - as a short driver who has to pull the seat far forward the cup holder winds up behind me!

"I worked at a major BMW dealer for six years and drove more X3s than I could possibly hope to count - I currently drive a CX50 PFP. 

If you care about driving dynamics, I believe the CX has the better steering feel (in many ways it’s a replica of a first gen X3 but that’s a different story). The Turbo will have comparable horsepower to the B48, and like others have said, reliability is comparable. 

You will absolutely save money on adding features that a lower-trim X3 won’t have (upgraded sound, wheels, the ADAS + systems, etc), and on service/maintenance/gas/insurance

TL;DR - you know how people talk about how the Miata is better pound-for-pound than a lot of more expensive sport cars? It’s sorta the same deal for the CX50.",mazda

"Recently purchased this used 2023 CX-30 Turbo Premium Plus. When I had it transported, it was covered in dust/dirt. After washing and waxing it, it looks good as new. I love the red. Too bad it'll eventually get chipped and/or dinged in a parking lot. I'll enjoy it while it lasts.

I'm the first person in my family to get a Mazda. They all stick to Toyota or Honda. However, I felt like Mazda offered better value when compared with the other brands' obscene ""reliability tax"" markups that dealerships get away with due to religious levels of brand loyalty.

Now that I have the CX-30, my family loves it. Despite the fuel consumption of the turbo (I get around 21.8 MPG with my lead foot), I think it's well worth it so far. Seems like a nice balance between performance, ""luxury"", aesthetic, and hopefully reliability (I have yet to come across any issues). Probably never going to look back at Toyota or Honda at this point, unless we get rid of those dumb franchise laws in most states that prevent consumers in the US from buying directly from manufacturers.",mazda

"That is insane. Cars in USA are way cheaper than they are in South Africa so I am shocked that a 15 year old Mazda 2 is that expensive there. Maybe it’s because they don’t sell them anymore in the USA and that is helping them hold their value.

The CX5 is one of the best purchases we've made, and we were originally in the market for Audi and Lexus. It's remarkable value.",mazda

Not pointing this out to be an asshole, I have a 6 that has the same stuff, other than the steering wheel, which is real leather (and honestly holding up much worse than the “fake” stuff.)

But the distinction is important when talking about it because you need to know what the physical material is. I’m not sure if it can be repaired, but there’s plenty of people who offer interior repairs.

"Brought the car to the dealer today. They just called me and said that the left wheel bearing is shot and needs to be replaced. They quoted 350,- including tax and installing costs.

Bummer. Had hoped the pre-purchase inspection would have pointed this out. So I called the company that did the inspection and explained them what is going on. To my surprise, they offered to wire 100,- to soften the blow. They also advised me to contact the seller (not an official dealer, just a 1-man operation). I have 6 months of warranty on the engine and gearbox there. He offered me to replace it for free! But I had already said yes to the dealer so they are already working on it, and since the seller lives 120kms away, that would have been a logistical challenge. So I asked if he'd be okay with also bringing in 100,- (I told him the inspection company is also doing so) and he immediately agreed. Very nice of both parties- my trust in them is restored. :)

Anyway, as far as the problem goes, I think at least the noise I was noticing around 55-60km/h (unrelated to this thread btw) should be fixed with a new bearing. And the dealer advised me to do things step-by-step, in other words: to check the highway noise again after replacing the bearing.

"Currently the owner of a 2019 CX-9 Grand Touring with 94K miles (I know, I drive a lot). Previously owned a 2015 Mercedes GLK-350. Here's my opinion...The GLK was an absolute dream to drive, quick, tight and just felt ""right"". I loved that aspect of it. The service experience was first class...loaner cars, espresso machines, you name it. The problem was cost. 

Everything about the GLK was expensive. I joke to others, but it's really true, that every time I took that car in for service, it was an $850-1000 bill. ""Luxury"" has a cost.

I test drove the CX-9 because I needed a little more room. I was blown away by how the car drove! I was blown away by the feature set and comforts. I was really blown away by the price (less than $40K). Service wise, aside from tires and brakes, I had one issue. Rear diff needed replaced after 63K miles. It was over a $3k repair, but the dealer only charged me $275, because the car was just out of warranty, and the rear diff should last the lifetime of the car.

4+ years later, I ALMOST bought a CX-90 PHEV. The only reasons I did not were 

a) first model year

b) over $60K out the door.

I will buy a CX-90 PHEV, but in a couple of years.

I traded because I am putting a lot of miles on and worried about maintenance expense as the car got older. The Mazda is different but enjoyable, drives like a smaller car despite similar dimensions. More humane rear seat for passengers, slightly less cargo room but better layout, and to my ears a better sound system. Peppy but not fast. Simple clean interior. Seats aren’t uncomfortable but they are very firm. Feels well planted at speed, fun to toss into turns, but stiff at lower speeds- I wish they hadn’t done 20” wheels. You’ll be happy in either car, just about different things - enjoy!",mazda

And sometimes the cabin and air filter need to be replaced earlier than that, which happened with mine. I noticed the air filter on my own without the dealer",mazda

"What a negative dorky argument to make, especially seeing as you appear to be a CX-50 owner. ""Don't have the money for a *real* luxury car"" just sounds sooo profoundly snobbish.

What do you think you're actually paying for when you buy a *real luxury* car? Theres about a 30-40k price premium for what amounts to badge snobbery/cache. Ive never been compelled or engaged by luxury brands, coming from a family that mostly owns German luxury and American sports cars. Feels like a need to impress strangers.   

*Make poor people believe they bought luxury*

"7500 is still okay, it's really based a lot on your driving habits. A lot of highway driving you can do 7500-10000 without any worry. If it's a lot of stop and go traffic or the car is on and it's just sitting there idling most of the time, you don't want to go more than 7500. Just never go more than 10k miles between oil changes.

My 2013 Mazdaspeed I change the oil every 3k miles, because I do a lot of in-town driving and I do some ""spirited"" driving sometimes, but it's also at 156,000 miles. My 85 RX7 I change it about every 3000 as well or once a year depending on which comes first because I don't drive it as often, plus its a 40 year old car.",mazda

"This whole thing is some sort of bias. Let me ask you, right after you bought your Mazda 3, did you suddenly notice other Mazda 3's on the road? I can't begin to count the number of ads I've seen on YouTube in the last week (it's gotten ridiculous), so the chance that one of those ads is something I've had on my mind recently is pretty good. And if I ever typed something into Google even remotely related, that chance goes up astronomically. So, what we do is that we think about something (a product, a brand, etc) then we are more keenly aware if an ad is presented to us related to that.

So, no, your car is not bugged. But Alphabet (Google) has a file on you that can predict the ads that will make the most impact on you, and they will often coincide with what you're thinking about.",mazda

"Modern turbo engines have gotten a lot better in that regard. In North America, most Mazda 2.5T engines are still running pretty well, bar that 21 batch with bad exhaust valve seals, which are most likely still under warranty anyway.

The problem with most turbo engines is that they don't really save gas unless you drive like a grandma and rarely use boost. Use any significant boost, and your engine runs rich AF to prevent knock, which destroys fuel economy. For reference, my Speed3 can be somewhat more efficient than a V6 of similar power if I take it easy, but I don't(otherwise I would have just got a Skyactiv 2.0). Add that to the premium fuel, and I spend more on gas than a V6 with similar power.

Mazda 2.5T supposedly uses an EGR cooler to help in that regard so your fuel economy is still close to the EPA tests even if you use some boost, but I have also seen people who drive Mazda3 with those engines hard and get *worse* fuel economy than my Speed3. At least they can run on regular gas.",mazda

Great tip,mazda
"A lot, the entire front end of the bumper, hood and headlights needs to be replaced that is given nothing behind the grill is broken - aka radiators etc.....Its hard to tell if anything else is broken without lifting the vehicle and checking underneath. But typical headlights these days goes for at least 2-3K.....The entire housing and compartment will be replaced and these aint cheap. 

Your front fenders might need to be fixed as it looks like its been pushed in. Given how the fenders are usually clipped on to brackets on the frame, the assembly brackets will need to be replaced (usually $20-30). Hood and front grill is relatively cheap if you can find a second hand replacement. If not brand new will cost 2-3K this usually comes with the cost of paint.",mazda

"A specific number of 2021 turbocharged engines were burning oil due to a manufacturing issue. Mazda implemented a repair and most should be fixed by now.  But the non-turbo 2.5L doesn't have any issues with oil consumption.

"I have those in my area, but depending on which ones you go to, a lot of them *technically* don't allow buckets.

Otherwise, you end up being a douche holding up the line while doing something that's not allowed. It's a public space, so you have to consider the courtesy part of it.

And when I go to those places for a relative quick rinse and brush(I rinse the brush before it goes on the car, and even then, paint on my Speed3 is the least of my concerns), I typically still spend about $16, give or take. The brush also doesn't work too well. If you are doing the bucket wash, I don't see it being that much cheaper than just paying someone else for the trouble.

The cx 5 is still a nice drive don’t get me wrong but was noticeably not as fun as the 30. But you get so much more storage. So that’s the main trade off you (and I) are going to have to decide between for those two cars, space v driving fun.

Color is just an opinion based thing she drove a white Forester talk about boring. We worked at a grocery store together and I knew his mother so the next time she came in I was like you see that sexy blue car out in the lot that's my baby. She got all flustered and agreed it looked good. I was like psh.. you can't even stand what you speak on. If someone else doesn't like it that's a them problem. I got the 2024 cx-5 deep crystal blue people on here have shit on the color but they'd rather have a white car or black which is fine just kind of boring if you ask me.

"Check the motor mounts (for noise at idle), focus on how smoothly the transmission is shifting. Ask for maintenance records. Check all the rubber bushings in the control arms (for rot due to age). Ask for the maintenance records. Check the oil, look for discoloration and note the level. Check the drive belts for rot and check the tensioners for leaks. Ask for maintenance records. And check the computer with an OBD2 and look for previous codes for misfires, the coils sometimes go out early and it'll through codes before they do.

Other than that you can ask for maintenance records and if anything seems off you can walk away. IMO the most important thing is maintenance and if they dont I know some basic information about then they probably aren't doing it.

""When do you usually change get your oil?""

""What brand of oil are you using?""

"in a nutshell, yes. I have a 2023 cx5 Kuro which comes with 19 inch wheels. For being such a firm ride, the cx5 has much more body roll than would be expected. Our 2020 CRV corners flatter.  The red leather seats look great but are way too firm for my liking and the nicely stitched steering wheel doesn't telescope enough for me so finding a comfortable position is still ongoing.

Finally if you stomp on it in EV mode, it’s not going to switch on the ICE til you hit the kick down switch which is how it’s supposed to work. 

If you want max power, switch to Sport mode or manually downshift using the paddles and you’ll get the power out of both systems. It’s no different than other cars that need to downshift when you floor it. If you want efficiency, drive it in EV.",mazda

Corolla Cross I sat in and said nope this isn’t for me looking for something a good bit nicer. I actually quite liked the CRV hybrid but the CX-50 turbo was clear winner imo. Really wish Mazda would make a CX-50 hybrid or bring back 6 and make it a hybrid.",mazda

"Mazda could’ve done a quick mix and match from their parts bin to create a limited run of LHD/RHD wagons with the 2.5 turbo, manual transmission and AWD as a sending off present for this venerable 10 year old platform.

"Yeah; normally decent manufacturers actually take vehicles into the wild with Camo on and test the vehicles extensively. And while not entirely will rid the vehicle of problems, it’ll minimize it at the very least, instead of having 38 (yes, another has been added this morning) for a single trim/model. That’s insane and unacceptable, whether that’s a first production year or the last. Plain and simple.",mazda
It’s the CPO that is the problem here. Any Mazda dealer is obligated to help you pay that that residual. It’s a contract. It’s not negotiable. Think of it as a balloon payment. And it’s not to the dealer. It’s to Mazda (well…Toyota). How many more payments do you have to go in your lease?,mazda

"I have one with rear captains chairs.  That is really the way to go with car seats.  My kids are big now, but when they were little we had a Mazda5 with 3 rows and 2nd row captains seats and that was great for car seats and boosters (still have that car, one kid is driving it now!).  But the bench is better for total cargo capacity.  The 3rd row in 40/60 split so you can put the 60 side down and still have decent cargo space.",mazda
"I would definitely get the single owner one. Rental cars you have no idea how they are driving it and the kind of people gets in it each week. 25k additional miles is really not that much, these cars are reliable cars. The single owner would definitely be taking care and driving the car better than the folks in the rental (not saying all the drivers in the rental is bad but the amount of different drivers and unknowns are too much). Te fact it is cheaper makes this a sweeter deal. I would not worry about the extra 25k miles and pick the single owner one right away",mazda

"1. Wider and better padded seats for driver. Fatter folks like me are not comfortable in the seats.

2. Arm rest could be higher.

3. Center tunnel could be padded for the knees, as it is the knees rest on the hard plastic and gets tiring.

4.  Dead rest for left food could be made a little deeper for tall folk as the existing design bends the knee sharply. I find myself stretching my left leg by bypassing the dead rest and stopping on the firewall instead.

5. The soft felt for the A-pillar covers eventually melt off and causes rattling. Fix this.

6, The cables that run above the headlining are not padded and routed well and rattle against the roof. Fix this.

7. Rear seats are upright. Bench is low and does not support thighs enough.

8. Resolve the quality issues pertaining to the phantom touch issue for the head units. Its a global problem and needs to be looked at.",mazda

"I’ll never understand this mindset (not yours specifically, but the point you are raising). Like, is that not just the cost of doing business? I feel like the options should be either ONLY accept cash, or realize that your business having the credit card reader is going to allow you to accept even more business, and so it’s in your best interest to pay the fees and accept the payment. 

I had a family member who owned a local small business and she was CONSTANTLY BITCHING about the credit card fees. I told her “so only accept cash then.” She was like “I can’t do that! I’d lose out on so much business since so few people carry cash anymore!” I said “then i guess the fees are probably worth it if they bring you so much more business then?”",mazda
"Yes I have. The CX-90 is front mid engine, where the engine is located in front of the passenger compartment but behind the front axle. Rear mid engine means the engine is located behind the passenger compartment but ahead of the rear axle, a common layout for exotic sports cars but unheard of in passenger SUVs. Please learn what things mean before saying them.

And from a design standpoint the CX-90 isn't Mazda's best work. It looks overinflated.",mazda
"If you had 59, you had an unofficial hack for Android Auto installed and yes, that one will get wiped when you upgrade. Mazda never officially released Android Auto on 59, 70 is the first version with it. That would also explain freezes and all the problems you had.

"CX-5 is older but has a more sophisticated suspension setup. CX-50 is newer, quieter and looks a touch rustic if that's your thing. Engines and transmissions are going to be identical, so really it comes down to how you find the interior space and which one you prefer to drive.

I know people love them, but I've never found Toyota's crossovers to be compelling. The corolla cross non hybrid isn't worth your time, the hybrid is solid but the CRV hybrid is even better.

I'd personally go for the CX-5 if this is your entire list, but really I would also recommend looking at a lightly used Volvo XC40. 2021 T5 R-Designs and Inscriptions are under $30k on the used market and come well equipped.",mazda

"Oh one more thing, dashboard likely will warp if exposed to sunlight often. Make sure you buy a screen for the windshield - there was a recall that expired few years ago.

Dashboard warping and TCM were my only problems. Dashboard is still warped, but i replaced TCM. You can avoid TCM replacement if you move it away from transmission to a cooler place.",mazda

"Not sure where you are hearing about a potentially new 2025 model. I haven’t heard of anything yet. I do understand that there is a new Mazda CX-5 that is early in development but nothing on other models. For the most part, I expect the 2025 CX-30 to be nearly identical to the 2024. Maybe the only change might a 10 inch infotainment system on the top trims (if that isn’t already offered on the 2024 models).",mazda
"I'd get the tires at a tire discount chain store, not the dealer. It will be cheaper.",mazda

"When I was in my early 20s, I bought a 2006 Mazda5. I LOVED it. There was something about the shape and the interior that I made me determined to buy one. The minute they hit the dealers, I got a test drive and fought some lady (figuratively) to buy the exact one I wanted. My family and friends made fun of me for buying a minivan, as a single guy. But none of them complained when I drove on trips or moved them out of state in it. It was fun to drive and I loved it. So who cares what they think. If they don't like it, they can walk!
Your friend also needs to get with the times; tell me what cars have red leather interiors now... BMWs, F-Line Lexus, XSE Toyotas, Mazdas, etc. Not old people cars at all.",mazda

"For some time in my country, it had the 1.5 liter skyactiv G, which was naturally aspirated, making around 115hp. Honest for a city car it would have sufficed especially being idle on traffic for long. But they ditched that now we have a 2.0 skyactiv G and a mild hybrid 2.0 liter.",mazda
Lol yea it's weird. Nothing has changed for the power train as far as I know so it's definitely weird. I've got the turbo so I'd be even more wary of going 16k km or a full year to change the oil.,mazda

Yes I know but I would have to find a dealer and possibly travel far to find a dealer that will honor the residual + taxes + tag and title.  I also want to activate the cpo and only a dealer can do it,mazda

EU hates combustion cars. They want to you but electric only. Your government is the issue here. 2.0 is small compared to other engine alternatives. Most car makers don't make less than 2.0 as far as I know.,mazda
Standard or automatic? If auto do you use paddles/shifter?,mazda
Probably not. A comparable German car would have been around $1k and Telluride was marked up by 20%.,mazda

All the dealers and most of the independent mechanics around me do the same thing. Credit cards charge an extra 3% so they can give you cash back.,mazda
"I don’t know how you’d put a percentage on it without measuring particulars, but they’re all essentially the same car. Same chassis, same engines, same transmission, ground clearance within an inch or two. They all just have slightly different packaging.

"Yeah, uh, having driven numerous CX-90 dealer loaners for extended periods of time while dealing with my lemon 2022 CX-5 Turbo Signature, they’re nice until you shut the door and the lower cladding rattles like a Daewoo, you notice how uncomfortable the seats are after an extended period of time, and recognize how generally plasticky/hollow/tinny feeling they are.  

Enjoy it, but sorry to say this does not hold a candle to an $80,000 vehicle, and it’s yet another overhyped vehicle.",mazda

"My band had a show and my steering wheel on the CX-5 was getting fixed so the dealer loaned me this instead of the 3 they were going to (needed room for gear). It was a treat for the 10 days we had it. Way too big for two people, but couldn't believe it's not technically a ""luxury vehicle.""

As for the show, having to park three blocks away from the venue because of its size was less than lovely, but the driving experience made up for it.",mazda

"Hmmm... not that bad, I think. For the touchscreen, it is optional. All the options can still be accessed with the physical knob, at least for Mazda, even when the touchscreen is not functioning. Apps don’t lose support because, we are mostly using Apple CarPlay. The subscription thing won't hurt much, it's all about the remote start feature only. (Also, at least for Mazda, can’t say for BMW, lol)",mazda
"From my personal experience, body shops can’t get Soul Red right.",mazda
"I mean, if you really mind it that much, getting an good used car will be your answer.

I get it, some people take it seriously, but IMO once you opt out of those data collection, there is little else you can do.

Also, maybe it's just me, but the whole ""opt out"" thing gives me Ashley Madison ""data deletion"" vibe. At least they aren't charging you for the ""data deletion."" Like, does it *really* do anything?",mazda

"Then the dealership charged you $1,300 for using them instead of just paying MFS the residual.  I don't know if your state is one that mandates it goes through the dealership but in NY the dealership has nothing to do with the transaction if you choose to buyout a lease.",mazda
"Others here have done it, what I've read is you must go to a dealership and ask for it.",mazda
"I think you might want to re-think that; I regularly drive from NC to NY.  Many new electric cars, like the EV6/Ioniq 5 can charge at 250kW.  Their large batteries are good for 300ish miles as it is, but with a 20% to 80% charge in 15 minutes?  Forgetaboutit!  :)  Fast chargers are being rolled out very quickly.  You probably have a lot right near you.",mazda
is this the inline 6 or the phev?,mazda
"Very glad I got to know this indeed. Even though I'm not sure if this will resolve the issue that I've described in the OP - it has to at least resolve the issue I noticed at more moderate speeds (>50kmh) when turning (even slightly).

Thanks again for thinking with me on this!",mazda
To me it seems like Mazda is becoming the luxury car brand and it could use a regular car brand.,mazda
"Less. In the higher trims I believe the google maps directions from your phone can pop up in the HUD in addition to a speed limit indicator but that’s not possible in the PP trim without an SD card. Even with an SD card, the PP doesn’t show directions in the HUD. It only shows the speed limit indicator and stop signs for the road you’re on",mazda
"Not sure why you would be accelerating while changing gears in a manual.

But no, in auto when you up shift you keep your foot down, no issue. You should not be accelerating when downshifting though, that makes zero sense.

Abusing an auto will wear it's plates out though, just like a manual.",mazda
"Glad I helped! My BMW dealer actually shared a parking lot with a Mazda dealership for what I believe was this very reason lmao.

Cool if Mazda declares it doesn’t capture audio. “Phone is listening” is not BS btw. I’ve worked in big tech. I know team mates who have worked on “continuous high frequency listener” components which is originally meant to detect devices nearby. But this can easily be repurposed to snoop on people.,mazda

"But, Mazda had one. It was Eunos. I'm gonna go with Eunos.",mazda
"Yep, I do not have a 360 camera on my Canadian 2019 CX5 signature. I think it was made available in Canada in later model years.",mazda
"Well, Model 3 is more Mazda6-like in size, and Model X 3rd row is very much tacked on since it's designed to be a 2-row SUV. Dunno about Australia, but in North America, Model X is also a lot more expensive than even the CX-90, and Model 3 is more expensive than Mazda3.

That leaves CX-5 and Model Y. Their price gap isn't as massive as the two previous pairs, but it's still there. These are still pretty different cars. Model Y is all about the tech and BEV experience, while CX-5 focuses on more elegant exterior and interior designs, build quality, and value.

In general, I don't see people cross-shopping BEV and ICE-only cars, especially when the two manufacturers are so different. ICE-only/hybrids or BEV/hybrids, sure, but it's not as common to see the major jump.

I feel like I need to do the math in the future to see if those used BEVs are worth it. On one hand, there are gas savings, but on the other hand, older Teslas were even more shoddily built and there is always that battery replacement argument hanging over you, which would effectively total the car. Insurance rate is a big factor as well. Maybe a cheap, fuel-efficient car makes more sense, but I have yet to do the math. Will cross that bridge when I get there.",mazda
Exactly. U poor. My point.,mazda

"How long do you intend to keep it?  

The Beemer will have some major maintenance costs at around 50k miles.  The Mazda will be more reliable especially over the long haul.  

I came to Mazda after three years in a 3 Series wagon I liked a lot.  No repairs in 45k miles but the dashboard lit up like a Christmas tree one night, no fault found but certainly seemed to be a warning of things to come.  

At the time (2019) Mazda had way less turbo lag but perhaps BMW has improved that since. 

BMW is a marvelous drive but frankly the Mazda is right up there.  If you care about appearances, the BMW will impress more.  But the Mazda will say you know value when you see it.",mazda

"The break-in oil will vary heavily between manufacturers. Some GM performance cars like newer Camaro SS and Corvette will recommend you get your first oil change at 500 miles, then again at 1000 miles just to get the metal shavings out. On the other hand, Honda uses a special break-in oil in their newer cars and you are just supposed to let Maintenance Minder do its thing for the first oil change.

You can argue 7.5k miles are fine with modern oil, but there is the oil saying of ""engine oil is cheap, engines aren't."" It's just cheap insurance to do it every 5k miles with synthetic oil, especially with turbocharged engines that's exposed to more heat and pressure.",mazda

"From your list CX-5, it is Mazda's best selling model and despite the CX-50 being sexy and fresh, to me it appears CX-5 more than outsells the CX-50, if you are okay with the aging interior (which is still miles better than a lot of cars), it's solid and reliable.

RAV4, well Toyota in general can't be beat for reliability, but I've been lately just ignoring Toyota, dealer markups are bloody crazy, availability is very bad, multiple years of wait and frankly, the interior, loud interior, engine noise, less legroom than the last generation, I'm a little lost why Toyota did that. 

Out of curiosity, why are you not considering the Tuscon, honestly they are very good cars, the current gen model has everything you can ask for, it's damn quiet inside, legroom is almost best in class, same with the cousin Sportage. You talk about resale value, I had a leased Tuscon in Canada which I traded in 3yrs (2022 model leased for 5yrs), despite having to pay for breaking the lease, I got more than the buyout, resale is there, you just need to negotiate honestly..",mazda

"There is now talk of asking consumers to change their expectations and demands regarding EVs, with industry insiders thinking that some consumers are being too petulant in asking for matching or surpassing the performance of IC engines at low cost with EV hardware using batteries. So the thinking is that the ultra-convenience of IC engine cars has made consumers too pampered, and even if EV chargers are not available everywhere right now, consumers should at least learn how to practice new driving habits like planning ahead of time how long they would drive, and where they can charge.

And these lines of reasoning are some of the reasons why EVs are being mandated in a mad rush, without scaling charging infrastructure, battery materials mining, and battery manufacturing rapidly right this moment.",mazda

I don’t know if this is an unpopular opinion or not but the red interior is just too much for me.

Every maintenance must be done when the display/wrench indication comes on. The display/wrench indication will come on before reaching the maximum interval of 16,000 km (10,000 miles), or 12 months (after the previous maintenance).
If you drive your vehicle under any of the following conditions, follow the Severe Driving Scheduled Maintenance and replace the engine oil and filter every 8,000 km (5,000 miles) or 6 months, whichever comes first.
Otherwise, follow the Normal Driving Scheduled Maintenance intervals:

The vehicle is idled for long periods or driven at low speeds, such as with police cars, taxis, or driver's education school car.

The vehicle is driven mainly unpaved road.

The vehicle is driven mainly on mountain roads or uphill roads.

If you are following the Severe Driving Scheduled Maintenance (8,000 km (5,000 miles) or 6 months oil replacement interval), set the vehicle status monitor manually.

"Let me explain it to you. lol Yes your car is AWD HOWEVER, your engine is transverse mounted. and sits in front of your front shock absorbers. That means your car is a FWD derived AWD vehicle. The majority of the weight is front biased because the entire engine is sitting in front of your shock absorbers. 

That’s why you enjoy longer leg rooms and overall bigger cabins. This is the typical request for the majority of drivers. 

However, the CX90 is a RWD derived AWD front mid-engine car. The engine sits longitudinally and is BEHIND the front shock absorbers. What you get is superior front and rear weight balance distribution and much better handling overall because of it.  This is what the premium brands have. BMW, Mercedes, etc.",mazda

"Superior handling? You're talking about a 4,000+ pound SUV. It's a fine product and all but being RWD doesn't automatically make it an autocross dominator. A 3, FWD or AWD, would make quick work of a CX-70 or a CX-90 through any type of corners, and that's just talking about Mazda's current US lineup. If we dig through the back catalog of quick FWD cars we find some real gems like the R53 Mini, the Megane RS, the GTI, or (almost) anything that ever got a red Honda badge on it.

A 1995 Ford F-150 also has a front-mid engine, rear-drive layout, but no one accuses that of having ""superior handling"" and demands that it never be compared to anything FWD again.

I'm not talking about the size of the CX-90 either. I'm talking about the styling. Whereas past Mazda SUVs have looked sleek and rakish, particularly the CX-5 and to a lesser extent the CX-9, the CX-90 has big puffy ""cheeks"" that look out of place on a current-gen Mazda product. Other similarly configured SUVs like the Q7 have a more refined style than the Mazda, though I'd argue the CX-90 is sold more on the value for money and interior quality.

As far as ""knowing what you meant,"" no, I didn't. You said ""rear mid engine,"" I questioned that, and you doubled down. You didn't know what that meant, and now you're saying more stupid shit about large SUVs out handling compact hatchbacks just because they're RWD, as if that were the only thing that matters.",mazda
"Orange peel is common when the paint is applied unevenly across a surface. For example, this can happen if a layer of paint is too thick and the solvent evaporates too quickly. This effect causes the surface to dry without getting the chance to level out properly.

You don’t think Mazda’s mechanics know about the owners manual?,mazda
Absolutely,mazda
I've only tested the 2.5l here in Canada but I can say that the Mazda 6 felt sportier and more stable in cornering most likely due to being a lower center of gravity and the longer wheelbase. Funny enough the cx5 has a tighter turning radius due to that shorter wheelbase so it might be better at getting in and out of tighter spaces. The cx5 sits higher so it's easier to get in and out if you're older or have mobility concerns. The 6 sits much lower and has sportier driving position. Other than that the fit and finish is very similar. Can't really go wrong with either option.,mazda
"I almost find it scummy to not just offer high end versions of the brand itself. These mirror and puppet games with mostly rebadged vehicles for twice the price is insane just for a ""luxury badge"".
I personally like what Mazda has done making their mainstream cars slight luxury while offering Luxury level high trims. Especially if they keep at the rate they are with the cx90.

All criticism considered, I still think that the 6 is a car that I would pick over the Accord and Camry just based on ""fun"" and character. The Camry and Accord. are much for spacious and functional, though.

I agree that the RWD architecture would make a huge difference. And it would be a unique car even when considering all the other cars. The closest to a RWD 6 would be a BMW or Audi but Mazda still would be 10-25k cheaper and much, much more reliable even in its 1st gen.",mazda

"The first thing to check, because it is a safety issue, is the condition of your wheel bearings.  Don't self-diagnose this without experience. Any mechanic, including even a chain tire store tech, can diagnose this correctly, and you don't want a wheel falling off when you're driving, trust me. 

A failing wheel bearing will have play when it's off the ground, and will often make a droning and pulsing sound at particular speeds (and sometimes you can feel it through steering response, in which case it's an urgent problem). Generally it's going to be one wheel at a time and come from one corner of the car (and will be more common on the front wheels) but it can be hard to tell from the driver's seat.  Sometimes it will be more than one wheel if it's the result of a road hazard you hit straight on.  Wheel bearing replacement should be $200-300 per corner. 

Also make sure your alignment is good. 

The second and most likely issue is your tires, even though you say they're fine.  Why are you running two different tires? I would put two more matching Pirellis on and I'll bet that solves it. It's always best to do all four tires at once. 

Also a professional musician and audio guy here, and an amateur mechanic myself. Good listening is really critical to good mechanical diagnosis. But experience with what problems sound like matters just as much, so I'd go take a test drive with a mechanic. I have a 2014 Mazda3 with 160k very reliable miles on it, and I will say it's just a noisy-assed car. Tons of road and wind noise.  I have found Pirelli Cinturato tires take a lot of the road noise down a few dBs. My stock Bridgestone Ecopias were so loud (and handled so poorly) I replaced them at 12k miles into owning the car from new.  And I've never gone back from Pirellis. 

You want softer rubber, not low rolling resistance, and ideally 16"" wheels help a lot if you've got the 18s now.

Super unlikely it's the drivetrain. Your car has very low mileage for its age.",mazda

It was a fantastic car at the price point (and tremendously well featured) it did not handle as well as the 2015 2.5NA 6 that we traded in for it.

RWD would make a huge difference.  When looking for a 3 row (trading in the 6) we test drove both the CX9 and the Grand Cherokee.  Despite being built by FCA, and being heavier, the Grand handles better by far.  You can really only do so much when the front wheels are doing all the work.  I'm sure the CX90 drives better then the GC now, but I'll keep the 5k lbs towing now that I have it.  We paid $10k more for the car that had fewer features (the 9 has a dedicated rear HVAC) because it had better visibility and didn't feel like we were driving a snail.",mazda

"So basically the material from which the exhaust camshafts were made was problematic, little shavings and particles found their way into the oil and destroyed the turbo (and more).On some model years, this was basically confirmed that this would happen and preventative measures had to be taken, or else catastrophic engine failures would happen. The oil pump was problematic, well the chain driving it would stretch and cause issues in lubrication. Then there was the DPF you mentioned. Mazda has acknowledged these issues, on some of the engine codes. You will find more into when you start browsing the forums, also which engine codes suffered more and which of them were less problematic. I don’t know if the new 3.3 inlines are affected, we will see in some time. However, I don’t see literally any point in going the diesel way, when Mazda, or generally japanese petrol engines exist.

Of course it cant compete with high loaded bmw/audi, but they will cost 90k euro. What you should think and do is compare mazda high trim with german cars poor packages.

Good to hear that you are doing fine, CPO probably helps. I just don't know how comfortable I would be with one of them without an extended warranty of some sort.

I also give BMW credit where credit is due. Valvetronics are brilliant mechanically(though they can have trouble) and some of their engines hold up a lot of power when tuned, but I am more old school, so simple pushrod V8s are my preference when it comes to that level of performance.",mazda

"I mean, I get that you get the cleanliness without having to risk damage to your paint with a hand wash, but encouraging *everyone* to do so just comes off a bit as ""let them eat cake.""

I hand washed before and it's typically a 3~4 hour ordeal, and that's without waxing or anything, just a wash to get the car spotless. You will have to have access to a running water source to connect a compressor(which in itself needs a power source, electricity from an outlet or gasoline).

I used to have time for it and friends I can borrow the compressor from, but that compressor got stolen one day, and none of us see it worthwhile to get another one because yeah, 3 hours for one car is a lot of time out of our day. 3 cars and you are looking at *10 hours*.

I also used to just go to a shop to get hand wash done. Their basic quick wash was CAN$50 or so. Very well done for what it is and no scratches, and I see Porsches and the likes there all the time. They have upgraded hand washes as well but they get more expensive and take more time. But you know, people don't always have CAN$50 they can just fork away every week, and my area isn't know to snow. Where OP lives?

"The BMW is going to be the better car dollar for dollar and are actually pretty reliable these days (all relative). That B48 engine is way more advanced than the Skyactive. Just look at real fuel economy numbers for how much power it makes. The Mazda is fairly pathetic in that regard but you pay for BMW engineering. 

The Mazda does well to look better than other economy brands but that’s what it is under the facade. The BMW is built on a much better architecture for driving dynamics and will be an overall more refined car. 

If you can afford the BMW I’d get it. For what it’s worth I got a CX50 and it’s great and I have no significant regrets. The BMW with the similar options was 10-15k more and not in my range especially with 0% 60mo on the Mazda.

"Hi fellow Mazda6 owner! I have a 2019 Mazda GT as well, and I think I had a family friend who did the labor for only about $200 or $150 cash, if you have any people in your inner or outer circle that know how to change brake pads and rotors, that can be very handy. The types of rotors I got were quite expensive, because I chose to get the high-end performance rotors (drilled & slotted for cooling & max performance) that were Powerstop brand.
The Z23 front and rear brake pads themselves were pretty cheap, knowing it was the higher of the two brake pad models that would fit my Mazda6. I just wanted to get high-end performance brakes and rotors for the sporty and sophisticated look, and to have something somewhat affordable that is “modded” and not stock that wouldn’t lower my gas mileage.
Anyways, I highly suggest the Z23 or even the Z17 (which is slightly less performance quality and slightly more brake dust, but only $8-$10 per pair cheaper than the Z23).

Here is a link from RockAuto which has good processing time and they’re based in California or Nevada, so for me, I had to pay a decent amount in shipping, especially since the rotors are very heavy, especially mine, but if you’re in or close to the west coast, you might have a cheaper shipping cost than I.

https://www.rockauto.com/en/catalog/mazda,2019,6,2.5l+l4+turbocharged,3442857,brake+&+wheel+hub,rotor+&+brake+pad+kit,13824

It breaks it down by kit and brand, and if it’s front or rear or combined (front & rear), but I would choose Powerstop since that’s what I know, and a lot of other people rave about them too. 

(I initially wasn’t going to include the RockAuto link when I was initially writing this comment, but it seems to be cheaper than Carparts.com.)

The Carparts.com listings have a few photos on the link below, describing the different tiers of rotors, and that might be helpful in helping you decide which ones might be best for you, and then you can buy them on RockAuto or Carparts.com if you please.

I assumed after getting a $30 rebate on each axle’s brake & rotors kit that the brake & rotor kits that fit you best would also have a rebate, but I guess the rebate is currently only for the high performance line that I got, so if you feel like spoiling yourself and getting the drilled & slotted rotors w/ Z23 brake pads kit for the rebate, then go you! 
(Btw, if you were to go that route, I would check if buying the ultra performance one in two separate transactions (one for each axle) is cheaper than buying them separately, due to the astronomical shipping cost of the combined front & rear kit.

Unlike Carparts.com, RockAuto doesn’t offer the Coated or OE Replacement brake & rotor kit for both axles combined, so you would have to add them separately. 

Here is a link from carparts.com that has a decent front and rear set of regular (non-slotted) coated rotors that won’t have rust, that seems pretty affordable for a brake and rotor set for both axles. 

https://www.carparts.com/details/Mazda/6/Powerstop/Brake_Disc_and_Pad_Kit/2019/Grand_Touring/4_Cyl_2-dot-5L/P15CRK8618.html

Here’s a slightly cheaper set from Powerstop, that is more closer to OE, which is the lowest level, but only slightly cheaper (I suggest the kit in the above link, but if money is super tight and you could use the extra $35-$50 bucks elsewhere, then the link below might be worth checking out)

https://www.carparts.com/details/Mazda/6/Powerstop/Brake_Disc_and_Pad_Kit/2019/Grand_Touring/4_Cyl_2-dot-5L/P15KOE8618.html

Otherwise, you can search online to find a front and rear combined brake pad & rotor kit online from Autozone or NAPA (I suggest NAPA because my family friend who did my brakes & rotors said the NAPA ones last longer and is more reliable)",mazda

"The Mazda 2 isn’t even sold in the USA. Instead it was rebadged as the “Toyota Yaris” which, in its previous generation, WAS made by Toyota itself. I’ve seen a few older Mazda 2’s here in the USA but that bottom-end of the market isn’t where Mazda wanted to be in the U.S. So when Toyota needed a Yaris update, a partnership was formed  (2016-2020). This car had a Mazda Skyactiv-G 1.5L engine with 106-hp (significantly less power than my 889cc motorcycle).

As far as I’m aware, the Mazda Skyactiv-G 2.0L engine is currently only available in the U.S. in the MX-5 Miata. Other current Mazda vehicles sold in the U.S. all have 2.5L engines along with the 3.3L inline-6 in the CX-90.",mazda

"So where in the hell do you drive 600 miles? That’s absolutely ridiculous. Most ICE vehicles get around 300 miles per tank, give or take. And the only time you hit that limit is when you’re doing a cross country/long drive. And most of the time you hit a gas station and catch a bite to eat, stretch your legs etc, so easy to spend 45-60 mins at a stop. So EVs with around 300 mile range meets 90% of the populations requirements but we’ve all been bamboozled by the ev haters and their mouth pieces in the media that 300 miles isn’t enough range. Sure, there are folks who need more range than that on a regular basis, and we’re not there yet with most EVs, but that’s the exception and not the rule. Placing an unrealistic requirement like this on an EV that you wouldn’t place on an ICE is just some weird justification for wanting to drive a gas powered car. I get it, I’m going to miss the throaty roar of my turbo powered fun box but I won’t miss the carbon spewing oil eating emissions overreach of the rest of it…",mazda

Sometimes an average looking chair might be designed, or the chair will be designed to look sleek and futuristic. Pretty much anything that might seem mundane, there needs to be a design for it. 

I’m guessing op is looking for things like the unlock button is too small and I can’t find it unless I look directly at it. The door handle looks cool but my hand can barely grasp it. I hate the shift knob and want something that looks more upscale. 

Things op is probably not looking for production decisions like “I want Mazda to design a pick up truck”, exterior design like “I want the car to have a rally style spoiler”.

I could be wrong, that’s my best guess.",mazda

"if your car is undriveable, this is a real problem.  Is car electronic power steering?  If so, check fuses, but if fuses blow that means the EPS could have a major fault as well as the SRS.

"It’s more complicated than that. You’ll want 3 buckets. One is a dedicated paint and cladding bucket, one is a dedicated rinse bucket for your towel and one is dedicated for your wheels. Why 3 buckets and not just one? Good question. Cross contamination. What you don’t want to do is drag the metal from your wheels coated in brake dust onto the paint. That’s not good for it. And you don’t want your wash bucket contaminated with the dirt you just removed from the paint/cladding. 

Now this sounds complicated but it’s really not. You can get bucket from Home Depot or Lowe’s for like 5$, they work fine doesn’t have to be something special. Then go on Amazon and get a grit guard for the bottom of the wash bucket, this keeps your rags from getting contaminated with whatever maybe floating around at the bottom of the bucket. Next find a high quality car wash soap, don’t use dawn. Mothers, meguirs and other smaller detail company’s all make pretty good stuff. Next get some high quality microfiber towels, wash them before using them but don’t use a powder detergent, liquid only. Rinse them twice. Then dry them on low heat twice. Take the tags off them before use. If you drop one toss it or move it to a dedicated wheel towel. 

Now fill your buckets. Two with soap and water and one just with water. Spray the car with water, pressure washer if you have one, if not a hose is fine, to loosen the dirt, then wash a section at a time. Do the wheels first, then spray clean, hood and fenders next, then the roof, doors, and hatch. Or reverse the order if you want. Doesn’t matter but wash from the top down, outside of doing the wheels first. Use light pressure. You don’t want to grind the dirt into the paint. You want to just move it away. Rinse your rag often, get that dirt out of the rag and into your rinse bucket. 

Next drying. Get a clean microfiber wet, wring the water out till it’s just damp and if you want to get something like a hydrophobic coating involved it’ll help. Again be gentle with the rag. Light pressure only. 

And you’re done. If you’re a visual learner, ammonyc on YouTube has amazing vids. And for the love of god do this in the shade when the car is cool",mazda

"1) you commented a car was beautiful because it's platform is good. Neither of those things are dependent on each other, there are plenty of beautiful cars who's platforms are garbage, and plenty of ugly ducklings on fantastic chassis. It's like saying a meal was good because it was expensive.

2) Dude we get that you're excited about your CX-90. Lots of people are. In fact some dude in a white one was so excited this weekend that he pulled out into oncoming traffic in a left turn with truly no room in either direction and I had to swerve my Miata to avoid while the oncoming car hit full abs. 

But Mazda built their reputation on not only the RWD Miata and RX models, but on their FWD chassis as well. RWD doesn't Automatically make a car great, there are plenty of boats and trucks mascarading as sports cars from the Americas and Europe, many still with understeer. The Mazda3 and Mazda6 over the years (323 and 626 before that) are prime examples of chassis that handle objectively excellent, and there's a reason those are beloved.

It's ok to be excited about the new platform, as we all are, but right now it's just in a family hauler replacement. Not in the sedans and sports cars we hope it arrives in, or that are actually dynamically rewarding, and not just rewarding compared to other SUVs in its class. What good is a RWD based system and decent front/read weight balance of the center of gravity is a foot higher off the ground? Trying to insinuate RWD is the only thing that makes or breaks a performance car highlights a major lack of automotive experience and expertise, and trying to put down anything that isn't like your purchase is cringy and juvenile.

That makes sense now that you take it to auto cross. I agree I would rather pay more for an LSD but I still think the wheel spin is fun. Plus with upgraded tires it isn’t that bad. That’s interesting your car does that with a rolling start because mine is pretty grippy with a rolling start but I have continentals. Before i put those on rolling start didn’t help much. They should’ve added the AWD tho since it’s in most 2.5 turbo Mazdas. Especially because they don’t offer FWD On the turbo anymore. Now that makes me appreciate it being FWD more because it’s more rare. Not really but since most 2.5 turbos are AWD I like it feeling a little different. I like wheel spin though but sometimes I like to imagine what it would be like with an LSD. Probably do 0-60 in 5.5. I know with continentals it does it in under 6 seconds,mazda

"There was a 1.5L version in 3rd gen Mazda 3s but it was really underpowered.

Moreover, Mazda is allegedly ending the production of the 2 liter Skyactiv-Gs. Dealerships in Hungary are ordering new cars with the 2.5L engine (limited to around 136 HP). That will be the only tier for Skyactiv-G, while the X still remains as-is.",mazda

"I went at the end of the month when they were trying to meet quota.

Here’s my take, go to KBB.com, enter the make and model you want. Enter the mileage you are willing to compromise with (I.e 25k in miles at most for a used). KBB should provide you a range. Now you know what the lowest range and highest range you can get for those miles for a car in good condition. 

I wish I had a diagram to show you of what KBB provides lol So pretend KBB says for a good condition, you can get anywhere from 18k-21k. Obviously, you chose 18k. Print this out and keep with you as you go to dealer to dealer. Don’t show the paper just yet. 

Go to the dealers, and try to get them to beat 18k out the door. Emphasis on out the door when you mention it. See what they say and agree to. 

Let’s say at dealer 1, you come to an agreement of 18970, dealer 2 19890, dealer 3 21k, etc. Tell each dealer to give you a print out or something to show this is what they agreed ( an email conversation is enough between you & salesman). 

Get in contact with them a week or two later, telling them that you came to final amount. Can they beat the price? They will whine and cry telling you … no, no they will lose money. Or come in, let’s negotiate. You stand firm and say, you are only interested if they can come to an agreement with set amount or else you are walking and going with so and so with their guaranteed price.

Alot of this is bickering back and forth. They’ll play mind games. You just have to learn to dissociate, and stand your ground.",mazda

i doubt there are any differences between body part numbers between 23 and 24 as there wasnt any body updates. being this early in the CX30's lifespan parts warehouse may still have already painted parts which may expedite the time but again the body shop involved with your insurance will have the estimate, not randoms on the internet.",mazda

"I doubt contacting corporate will do much, but I’d honestly see if you can leave a report for good measure. I do know Mazda corporate made a concerted effort to improve its dealership experiences as it’s been the achilles heel keeping them from being more successful as a brand.

"I don't know how the CX-90 bench is, but I also have a CX-9 (and a Mazda5...and a 3) and in the 9 you can slide the rear seats up and independently as they are 40/60 bench.  You can slide the captains chairs up and back a bit.  But you can't really get in the back without tilting them.  The dog may be able to get through.

When we took trips in the Mazda5 when the kids were little, we often had one in the 2nd row and one in the 3rd row and my wife or I sat in the other captains chair.  That worked out pretty well.  We did the same with the CX-9 later on, but the bench made it harder to reach back to the rear kid.

Good luck!",mazda
"Your friend did not pay for the car nor is she driving it. So her opinion is worthless.

I like the fact that you admitted that you are generally the more critical/judgemental one. She was obviously having a bad day. Hopefully, she'll shut her mouth ragging on your vehicle, and you can both put this behind you. Let it be a lesson that being critical has a time and a place. It should not be dealt out freely.

About being unsure of the colour. I can relate. I have the worst time deciding which colour I like best. At the end of the day - all Mazda colours are fantastic. You literally can't go wrong with what colour you end up with.

I think the biggest thing hindering your mindset is that your previous vehicle got stolen and your hand was forced to buy a new one. It's unfortunate that it happened this way but you can't control everything in life.

You don't realise it now - but Mazdas are gems. Just take it for it's services on time, and keep up with the maintenance. And you'll hopefully have a reliable vehicle for life. The design language of Mazdas are breathtaking. And they are amazing to drive.",mazda

My friend’s husband makes stupid money as a doctor.

He bought himself a brand new Mercedes all black, inside, outside, rims, and that matte black paint too.

He loved this car and all the details, he was super enjoying his new car and showing it off.

Then a couple weeks later he met up with his brother, who laughed and said “this is the most girly car, only girls get matte black.”

For the next few weeks, he lost all his joy, he was upset, hurt, even embarrassed. No one could convince him his brother was just jealous and trying to get to him. 

He stopped driving his car and instead was driving his wife’s car and then he went to the dealership and traded it in at a significant loss for the most generic car he could think of.

I don’t know how it makes you feel, but to me it makes me mad for him that someone stole his joy and he couldn’t win it back.

I hope you can win back your joy.",mazda

"While true, I also don’t think there is a market for a pricey I6 midsize sedan that doesn’t don a proper luxury badge. How many of these would Mazda be able to sell?

On the other hand, other brands have demonstrated that people don’t mind what the badge on a car is if it’s properly hybridized or electrified. See: Hyundai/Kia being able to commend high prices for their EVs, despite their brands not being premium/luxury.

As much as I hate to say it, I think bringing the Mazda6 back as an EV is the only viable way to bring it back as a midsize sedan and not some frankenstein-ified lifted sedan/CUV mix like all the weird coupe CUVs being sold nowadays.",mazda

If you’re not set on a sedan I’d look at the hatchbacks. Hatchbacks are made in Japan and sedans are made in Mexico. Look at the VIN if it starts with 3MZ it’s a Mexico build. Built in Japan starts with a J. From my experience working at Mazda the Japanese built cars have less problems.,mazda

- I’m surprised that people don’t discuss this issue more but the rear differential in the AWD models have a habit of making a high pitched wineing noise at 75-78 mph. This is apparently a design quirk but honestly I feel like it’s a design flaw… please fix this.

"Yes orange peel is a known issue on many vehicles however there is also such a thing as stone guard paint and it doesn’t flow as smoothly as regular paint when applied.

My 2016 BN Mazda3 had it as did my 2015 DJ Mazda2 on their rocker panels which were both purchased new.

It’s not rust, don’t jump to the worst case assumption and put fear in them. It’s likely just stone guard to protect the rocker panels from rocks and stones flicking up and causing the paint to chip. Even running my hand along mine I can feel that the rocker panel paint feels more dense and almost rubbery like stone guard paint typically feels.

"It works for Tesla because a lot of features are locked behind a software paywall, instead of having hardware differences. I think for Model 3, you technically only really have two versions, RWD and AWD. You can buy an AWD standard range and upgrade it to Performance even after purchasing with relative ease.

But then, that's added cost to the manufacturer because they still have all those unused batteries in the standard range models. Any colour other than that one specified colour also costs a horrendous amount of money. You think Soul Red is expensive? Wait until you try and get a Tesla that's not grey(used to be white). That's why people wrap their Tesla's.

Imagine upgrading a GX/Select Mazda3 to a GT Turbo/Turbo Premium. You are much better off selling the base trim and then getting the top trim model. Building all the features in and then using a software paywall adds manufacturing cost and as BMW has proven, is a PR disaster.

And yes, the cost to the consumer is really the same. Dealers get wholesale prices because they can get a ton of cars at once. Wholesale is generally a lot cheaper than retail since it helps streamline the production process. It also gives manufacturers a buffer so if the market shifts, they don't have to drop the MSRP directly and destroy the resale value of your car(you know, like Tesla did). It's the dealers' problems to figure out how to sell cars.

I think direct sale is a good model to try and add competition to weed out bad dealers, but it requires a lot of things to work.",mazda

"It's not stone guard paint, at least it wasn't stock if this is an American 3d gen Mazda3. It could have been applied aftermarket of course. Mazda  did not ""improve"" it between 2014 and 2017. I've seen plenty of other third Gen cars of all years and never seen or heard of stone guard paint as an OEM feature. I just googled to be sure, no mention of it. 

Mazda happily pushes paint protection film as a solution to  chipping from rocks and stones. It isn't built in to the paint on the US  third generation cars, I don't know if it's an option on 4th generation or in other countries. 

I did *not* say it was definitely rust. But unless it's aftermarket stone guard paint,  it definitely is paint failure and ""orange peel"" is that. That can happen because the paint was poorly applied at the factory, and it can happen because of underlying corrosion. 

Let's wait and see what OP discovers.",mazda
Thats a great argument. Lol. 100% proving me right. You just told us that you used to be poor so you bought a Mazda and now you have money so you have an AMG. Case and point. Thats hilarious.

It’s a good example of “having your cake and eating it too.” I feel like the mindset should be “I can either accept credit cards or not. If I do, I pay a fee, and I’ll need to determine if that fee is worth it for the extra services I’m getting, such as extra business for the people who might go elsewhere if I don’t accept credit cards.”

Instead, most fucking business owners think “I want this service, but it’s not fair that I should have to pay for it myself.”",mazda
"Personally, if I were to get a used car and it’s been in an accident, I would walk away. I don’t want to deal with other problems later that may stem from it.  If it doesn’t bother you, haggle HARD.

"I don't think so. I own a 2014 3, basically the same car as this, and the paint is smooth everywhere.

This is classic ""orange peel,"" it's a flaw, and it means either the paint was improperly applied or there's corrosion and rust underneath it.

"I respect your opinion but don’t really want to get into the tropes of Tesla quality and EV fires. In a crash, a petrol car is more likely to catch fire than an EV. You are riding on top of insanely combustable liquid protected by a thin layer of steel. So if fire safety is a concern, you should probably ride a bicycle.  

Why would the Tesla board let Elon run Tesla into the ground? It’s like worrying if the Mazda ceo will run Mazda into the ground. 

As cars get safer and safer, there are higher chances of cars being written off during minor accidents. 

Most car crash testers have adapted new tests after Tesla introduced their own tests. The last companies to do this were Volvo for example.

Fairly straightforward DIY job if you're patient and take care with each step. Only thing I'd say is when using the ratchet to remove the touchscreen to get behind it, make sure you don't drop the screw removing/reinstalling, I used tape to help keep it on the ratchet while rescrewing.",mazda

"Bare minimum in europe is about 0.9 (Renault) and 1.0/1.2 is usually base model, 1.5/1.6 is a premium version (VAG). All these are mostly turbo/hybrid/both. Mazdas 2.0 and 2.5 NA really stand out in the european market. And we don't get mazdas turbo models at all.",mazda
"Agreed.   Some years back I took a brand-new MX6 (Mystere)  from Vancouver to Calgary, about 950km down the Trans Canada AS the break-in. The trip took 12 hours, with  a lunch stop about half way there.

The little 4-cam V6 purred the whole way.  I did change the oil at the Calagary Mazda dealer while I was there, then about ten days in drove the car back.

We left the Island with 235 or  so Km on the odometer.  Had the car for 6 years, nary a whimper under the hood.

"Model 3 is Mazda 3 size. Mazda 3 fwd 2.5 top spec here in Australia is $5000aud less than rwd model 3. Used prices though obviously fair better for Tesla, where I could pick up a 10,000km dual motor model 3 for the price of a new Mazda 3 sp25 fwd top spec. 

If you drive a lot, you will save a significant amount of money long term on bev. Electricity is so much cheaper than petrol, and knowing how inefficient ICE engines are. Of course buying an insanely cheap used ice car will be cheaper long term than a much more expensive bev. 

Model y has a bigger boot, is cheaper to run, has more features, cheaper to run and service, faster, more efficient, and is safer than cx5 for instance. So it depends on priorities really. I would get the model y everyday over the cx5 as a family car only if I had a garage.

The cx50 is a new model and is still having improvements made to it. If I had to choose, it would be the cx5 for the way it rides and handles. The rav4 I would probably choose as back up, if I can get the xse hybrid. I will not get a rav4 by itself though. Hybrids a must. Cx5 next year may come with hybrid. So I’m waiting on that",mazda

"If you're going base model, I'd lean heavily towards Mazda. Both the CX-5 and CX-50 have AWD on the base models and, as others have mentioned, a non CVT transmission.

My wife and I have been loving our new CX-50. I never gave myself the opportunity to try the CX-5, which I regret because I heard it's a more comfortable ride. Also, ask if you like the head unit and are willing to learn to use the scroll knob. Personally, I love it and can't look back verses my wife, who isn't a big fan.

I mentioned that Toyota uses a CVT transmission. I had a '09 Camry that met its end at 300,000 miles. The transmission is tried and true and is not like the horror stories you hear from Nissans Jabco. You can't go wrong with either Toyota or Mazda, but Mazda offers more value.",mazda

"Had my Master level technician at Lexus say this too. He still swore about changing the first oil at 1000-1500 to rinse the break in residue and small metal particles out. Yes, there's a filter to catch most damaging particles as other comments have said, but there still some fluids and particles from manufacturing that are not caught by the filter. 

For me, and extra $50-70 dollars in coats isn't asking  much to make sure parts cleaner, and machining oil isn't left behind. Every engine assembled is only as the guy doing it, and some people have bad or lazy days...

People will also swear by the manual schedule, and I understand that, but things aren't designed to last forever anymore. Oil being the most important fluid for lubrication and heat removal, I change it more often than recommended especially for Turbo cars that cause more heat and stress. 

There are oils made for better MPG but that's kind of a gimmick. The oil is slightly thinner making it easier for the oil pump to circulate, this needing less engine power, saving you gas. There isn't any real measureable difference, you might save $50 in fuel over 6 months. It doesn't add to much of anything.",mazda
"I would argue for someone who knows they aren't going to keep a car long term its a good way to save a few $'s. In my case; It's a way to affordably get out of a car that I'm not sure is going to last another 20k miles without needing serious work while also keeping the time frame for being in the next one relatively short.

"So... handling on the RAV4 felt more like a pickup truck to me.  Engine was loud as well.  As for CX-5 and CX-50.  Really it comes down to features and where it is built.  I chose CX-5 because I wasn't a fan of the panoramic sunroof.  More glass means if something goes wrong, it is a costlier expense to fix.  But to each their own.  I also liked how the CX-5 handled.  

But, all three are decent cars, I am guessing you two might have a difference of opinion since you are asking about which to choose on Reddit.  You can always go back and re-test drive the three cars.  I felt that helped make the decision for me, but make sure you test drive them back to back so you remember the feeling.

"Ball joints are creaky but the lower control arms are rust welded on and my lease forbids working on cars, so if that goes sideways and it's obvious its in the process of being worked on it'll get towed. So I'm kinda waiting until I have some extra money to take it to a shop. 

Belts have been done twice and water pump once. All the fluids have been changed several times over and oil has been every 5k with the exception of a road trip where it was done at 7k. Only oil leak is from the OCV seal which will be replaced as soon as I get one. Shocks and struts have been done. Plugs every other spring which I know is overkill, but I do brake pads, coolant, and spark plugs every other spring no matter what cause its cheap, I do the serpentine belt on the Miata along with that cause it takes 15 min lol. 

I have had a super intermittent random misfire code in below freezing temps, and while trying to figure that out replaced the ignition coils which did not resolve it but I figure is preventative maintenance at this point, whatever, my spark plugs do seem to have less build up since. While I was failing to replace that seal I also removed the intake mainfold to inspect the valves because I've had a bit of a drop in gas mileage along with the misfire. They had some build up but not anything like the horror stories/pictures I've seen with some GDI motors, so I did a light cleaning to get the big chunks out, and got all the gum out of the throttle body, and replaced the PVC valve since it was right there. It does seem to idle smoother, especially on cold starts now. 

I did notice the old PVC valve, intake manifold, and valves on cylinders 2 and 3 had a very thin layer of oil. I'm consuming less than 1/3rd a quart between oil changes, so I'm assuming this is fairly normal? 

The only other thing that seems amiss is the transmission is weeping fluid. I found a service manual that shows that seal is basically some kind of RTV, so I'm assuming its just old, and as long as it doesn't get worse I'll just wait until the clutch finally needs replaced at which point it'll need taken apart and resealed anyway. 

Anyway thanks for the insight, its appreciated and I'll keep an extra eye on the timing cover :)",mazda

Familiar with the part having replaced it on my old car. There seems to be different names for it. It allows the vehicle to safely vent fumes from fuel.

Plus, they are able to do an inspection of the car, which helps let me know if my cabin air filter needs replacement or so, but I never let them do the rest.",mazda
“Practical” vs fun to drive are IMO two different market demographics. I personally drive a Subaru Sti and an Acura tlx and I’m looking for something bigger that is fun to drive and looks nice with some reliability. Practical gets thrown out the window for me. how often am I going to need that amount of extra space for cargo and if I did they make roof racks or use the trailer hitch. I come from the era where they had so many options of cars and niche trucks and suvs. I’m glad Mazda isn’t following the norm and slapped an inline 6 turbo at lower price. Toyota got a little boring even the CEO admitted they’re trying to fix that. “Don’t call our cars boring anymore” well sir Mazda made your Highlander look boring 😂,mazda
"120,000 miles is nothing.

"This then goes opposite of your ask above to reduce the size. Turbo is now being placed everywhere as a direct result of engines are getting smaller and smaller (and making less power) to meet regulations set by each's government. Sure you can optimize and squeeze *some* extra power while keeping it the same size but not nearly as cheap and quick as slapping in a turbo.

Honestly I can't understand how a 2.0L is considered luxury anyway. Sounds like a money grab from politicians. Soon they'll make 1.6L luxury and we'll all need to buy go carts... or encourage electric which is the true intent. Either way you'll be paying more to drive..",mazda

"I looked at all of these but instead of the CX-50 I had the Tucson on my list (cx-50 wasn’t out yet).

I’m not even mentioning the Tucson because I didn’t like it at all. Now between the cx-5 and the cx-50 I would personally buy the cx5 again for these reasons; cx-5 is made in Japan better overall build quality, the cx-5 has been in production longer (less issues to worry about), and even though the cx-50 has higher ground clearance, it being so low gives me Subaru Outback vibes.

The GLC in 5 years will likely have no issues aside from the usual maintenance, but do you plan to keep it longer? If yes, say 10 years, and it's a daily driver, this is where then I would lean towards the Mazda to avoid issues that comes with age and miles.

Too bad Mazda's new CX-70 didn't turn out to be in the 186"" size too, otherwise that would have been your best option to compare it with.",mazda
Thank you!!,mazda
"New model years typically arrive in September or October. Often changes are announced, even if minor, a month or two before that.",mazda
SHEESH,mazda
"Yes, especially because you have a larger vehicle to use. Daily drove a NB for 4 years before kids. It’s just a blast to drive",mazda

How bout bringing back the last generation Mazda 3's C pillar while keeping the new lights?,mazda
The new transmissions use clutches and torque converters - they handle all that stuff - when you're ready to shift bump it and keep the gas buried - it makes no difference.,mazda

i got my mazda a little over one year ago..?,mazda
"Look up “torsion beam” first, then cross CX-50 off the list.",mazda
"lol, the 60 is a much more cohesive design.",mazda
"Ahh looks like they were two. The last accident was in 2020, I can’t see the details. The one before was in 2018 and it caused cosmetic damage.",mazda
"Lol that's ridiculous. That's probably the biggest car dealer in Melbourne and they can't afford to pay those stupid fees? 

When I was shopping around for my Mazda last year, they were nice but wouldn't really budge on price for a new 3 sedan and the used cars they had were very overpriced.

I ended up going to Orlando and getting a much better deal. Probably because they have 4 Mazda dealers in Orlando.",mazda
Seems you only drive Porsches haha,mazda
"Don't know about price brackets because my CX50 is a turbo and in a different state, but I was also debating between the two. I liked that CX50 was longer because, in my opinion, it offers a bit more safety. You dont get as much bang for your buck with the 50 just because it's a bigger car, but if you're getting the premium, that might not matter. A big selling factor for me about the 50 was the 0% APR deal they have rn. I also liked how the 50 drove a bit more. I went from a pretty big heavy car to the CX50 and appreciated how it felt almost like a sedan while still being a fairly big car. I felt like the 5 was a little less fun to drive.

At the end of the day, it's what you feel comfortable spending and what you prefer driving. Where I lived, the highest trim of the CX5 was the same price as my CX50 Turbo Trim (about the middle trim). Just hit a 1k miles on my CX50, and I am very happy about my purchase!",mazda
"I got a new nd2 rf as my daily and it has been a blast. 

Fantastic gas mileage and insurance was only $15 more a month than my 2010 wrangler. 

The car is definitely a louder than a cx5 for example (More engine, road, wind noise) however, coming from the jeep with the plastic half door windows this thing is so quiet!",mazda
"Ah right, no PHEV, that’s true. I thought they were able to run on just the electric motor, but I was wrong.",mazda
"I have a 2017 mazda 3 hatchback with only 155hp. I was looking to buy another one for a family member this year but they don't have it anymore. 

Personally, i don't need 191HP for a small compact sedan.  I will looking at a corolla or civic at this point.  I don't like low profile tires either since they are worthless and expensive to replace beside just for look.  If you just need a vehicle to drive from point A to point B.. looks is the last thing I care about imo",mazda
More power closer to 200hp,mazda
"I love our PHEV Premium Plus as well. 

I have a couple friends who had dismissed Mazda CX-90 after showing ours and they went with the a base engine Grand Highlander for 54k. The interior is vastly inferior but I have to give them kudos for storage space. Meanwhile, I’ll zoom while getting better mpg, more power, and a big smile 😃.",mazda

"Its a soft top convertible, it comes with the territory. If I'm driving with the top down on the highway I pop in some adjustable ear plugs and then all I hear is a bit of the wind noise and alerts.",mazda
"Thanks for your replying. It's very informative, I appreciate it. To address the safety concern: I should have mentioned in the OP that I already have an appointment at a Mazda dealer come Tuesday to retrofit it with Apple Carplay and to have them test drive it to see if they can diagnose the noise.

I had the car inspected pre-purchase (by an independent mechanic), but this was with the old rear tyres. It was inspected also on a bridge and no weird things were found, so I don't think this car has been in an accident. They were two different rear tyres and I was advised by that mechanic to at least have the rear tyres be replaced. I can imagine that it's always better to have all four be the same, but I was under the impression that at least the tyres on each axle (front/rear) should match. The seller agreed to replace the rears for no extra cost. 

I just checked: it's the Pirelli P7 Cinturato 215/45 R18 (rear) and Bridgestone Turanza T005 (front). I have the 18"" wheels. I have no idea about car tyres, just reading what is on the sidewalls... Are they any good? If I were to replace either the front or rears, which one would you keep?

The dealer said they would test drive it and call me if there's any extra cost (on top of 349,- for Carplay, which is also what the Mazda website quotes). 

Thanks again for replying, really!",mazda
"Pretty much just look for rust. Seems like a good deal. Tires look like they have good tread but maybe look for a date on them too, make sure they are not too old. These are fairly reliable fun and good on gas.",mazda
"I had an accident front right fender, overall it was better than this, costed 6500.",mazda
"Just seeing the comments, I don't think an ice or even a hybrid version of the 6 would sell. They need their own EV to compete with the Model 3. 


People didn't buy the Mazda 6 Turbo. What makes it likely that an rwd inline 6b w/ a manual transmission will turn into sales? The enthusiast crowd is the worst to follow when trying to sell cars. Even the mustang has a ""plain"" turbo 4 cylinder that helps pay for the GT and mach one.",mazda
Not the place...,mazda
I'd say a 2 row vehicle is not comparable to a 3 row vehicle.,mazda
Check your spark plugs. Had a similar issue on my 2013 CX-5 at around 75K miles.,mazda
"Idk if 2 are included.  I got an email when I leased my 21 cx9 that stated 2 oil changes.  When I went for the second the dealer said we don't offer 2, only 1.  I had to find my year old email to get them to do it.",mazda
"I don’t consider there to be any significant differences in drivability. None of them are what I’d call drivable cars to begin with, just economy commuters, and they all drive fine for what they are. You’ve obviously driven them all yourself since you’ve commented on the drivability, so just get whichever one you preferred.",mazda
Sounds like maybe OP has trouble with tasks like this do to his injury unfortunately,mazda

I like EVs but havw not been able to love them. For me, a plug in hybrid with a 50km or more range is the perfect match. Also, OP if you Mazda is gonna be costlier, look at the offering by VW with 1.5 TSI engine, it is on my wife's car and is a great fun engine",mazda
"It could be occupancy sensor, seat belt sensor, open-circuit in the airbag igniter or wiring... kind of anything SRS-related.

You need to get a scan tool that can read mfr-specific codes from the various CAN bus modules (specifically the SRS module) and not just the standard OBD-II codes.

I use a PLX Kiwi^(3) with OBD Fusion and in-app purchase for my specific make/model/year to access all the CAN modules. You might also be able to do it with FORScan or other options.",mazda
Thank you! I appreciate the explanation.,mazda
Does mazda not use the AGM batteries since that's actually for these more modern cars?,mazda
Need to know more info before giving any advice. What trim are both vehicles? If ones a GX and the other is a GT the comparison will be much different. What do you like to do with your vehicles? Do you need extra cargo capacity for going camping or do you live in an area with harsh winters where AWD would really be beneficial?,mazda
Mine seems okay for now... No transmission or engine issues yet. At 220k miles. The rust is consuming it though and it's falling apart underneath 😬 it keeps dropping pieces of rusted metal. Idk.,mazda
That's called orange peel and most commonly means metal is rusting underneath paint,mazda
