"The slip and vdc have to do with wheel sensors. One bad sensor will trigger this.  You also have a low pressure on a tire (TPMS warning).  If the tire is low enough, the diameter of the tire will affect that wheel sensor and possibly cause this fault.  The brake light is likely an adjustment to the cable",infiniti

"The 3.7 V6 Q50 is about as reliable as a stock V6 can get, these days. You may encounter the errant oil consumption issue, maybe a minor leak, but overall the VQ37 is a solid motor. Basic maintenance and preventative care will keep it running to 200k miles, without breaking a sweat or really the bank. Hell, in this sub, alot of the users like to flex how many miles *they've* taken their motors. The 3.7 V6 Q50 is *good* to go.


Now, the twin turbo V6 is generally regarded as reliable, provided again that it's kept up with. You'll definitely hear about turbo failure issues, but that's *going* to happen to any car with a turbocharger. Generally speaking, for a sport-tuned twin turbo V6 sedan, the red sport is pretty up there in reliability. It's the fancy car that can handle being beat on like a sports car. Maybe you don't want a Q50RS; the Kia Stinger is basically the Korean version, and IMO better looking one (sorry, sub).",infiniti
"2010 armada platinum. That thing has been such a great vehicle. Bought it at 5 years old with 70ish k on it. I had originally wanted a QX but couldn‚Äôt find one with the year/mileage I was looking for that had a bench in the middle row, and that was a deal breaker for my wife. 

I did have to have it towed for the first time a couple months back because the alternator went out on it, but other than replacing things that just wear out on cars with that many miles (air bags in the rear suspension had a hole in it. Replaced both front calipers and the lower brake lines at about 200k because one of the pistons wasn‚Äôt releasing and used up a set of pads in like 8k miles) it‚Äôs been years of trouble free ownership. Just did yet another 1100 mile round trip to the in laws. Gonna be a sad day when I have to get rid of that thing.",infiniti

"could also be ball joints. my drivers side front balljoint went out and started with little creaks like this, then eventually made very loud squeals and squeaks. the ball joints are permanently mated to the upper control arm, so you gotta replace em both. try lubing any metal to metal areas and see if it goes away. i prefer graphite lubricant but use whatever",infiniti

"It‚Äôs a common issue, it‚Äôs usually because the rear timing cover seal starts to leak and bleeds back into the motor and burn more oil. The tail tell sign is you‚Äôll get some VVT codes due to the lack of oil pressure in the solenoids. That‚Äôs when you know the leak is bad. There was also a bulletin for excessive oil consumption. Honestly I‚Äôd throw some heavier weight oil in there. The rear timing cover leak will almost always be the main reason for the consumption.",infiniti
"You should get around 17-19 MPG's. Also, remember that Infiniti prefers premium gas. The only problems I've read with the turbo motors were the turbos themselves. If possible, look for a model with a 3.7L V6 to avoid those problems if you don't want to dump money into maintenance.",infiniti

"What year and mileage? What I did first was to get a multi point inspection from an infiniti dealership (make sure you decline all the services to fix) their inspection will give you items that are critical to be addressed or recommend to service soon.

After that, I started changing the fluids. I actually just got my transmission, front&rear differential, and the transfer case changed recently. I already had a coolant flush after the multi point inspection pointed out worn hoses causing a coolant leak.I got it replaced from a local mechanic for a fraction of the cost.",infiniti

I did a DIY drain and fill using Idemitsu fluid and the downshifts got quicker. Followed that with two more drain and fills about 2,000 miles apart. My transmission works great, but I know why the dealer told you what they did. Unknown service history creates doubt and possible problems. If you do a change, use the specific fluid recommended, NOT a universal fluid. You COULD drain and measure, then take half of the old fluid and add an identical amount of new fluid and pour it back in. That way some of old friction material that has worn will be replaced. But usually a drain and fill is safe because you're not replacing ALL of the fluid anyway. Your decision.",infiniti

You should have hot air out of the vents at idle when you are done.  If not, there is still air in the system.  The heater should work even if the thermostat is stuck.

"Props on your search skills. The only vehicle here that was really born a factory ""sport"" model is the sedan. XS Awd sedans don't have sport suspension or Akebono brakes. It's more practical due to 4 doors that open wide and rear headroom for 6 footers (Coupe rear headroom is absolutely non-existent if you're over 5'5""). Priced accordingly since it's in perfect condition assuming meticulous maintenance. 

2 is the best choice since you get a coupe and awd.  $11.4K at a dealership (get a warranty) and it's stock with no accidents. Gotta assume it's unmolested. You can take the $3k saved and buy IPL bumper, springs, paddle shifters, etc yourself. 2013 already has the updated headlights and is pre-wired for the paddle shifters. Polish your oem bumper before removing and resell on ebay. 

3 & 4 were hit and repaired. Usually those cars are in front-end collisions, and owner upgrades to the sport bumper for like $200 over the factory one.

"I dealt with this on my 2007 G35S sedan. 
The honeycomb core separated from the catalytic shell- this happened on passenger side of my G.  
A good sign of this issue is the rattling can be heard at low rpm/idle only. Once RPM is over 1200 it goes away because exhaust pressure pushes the core toward the rear and stops rattling. 
I drilled a couple of holes and used 1 inch screws to hold the honeycomb material in place and all rattling stopped. No exhaust leaks either.

"Thanks for the response here goes:  


It is on a slightly uphill driveway and on some slim ramps (about 5"" lift).  We've tried the revving per the factory procedure a couple of times.  We're using one of those no-leak funnels on the radiator cap.  I originally did the squeeze the first time and we thought it was done.  


I was using the bleed valve at the back of the engine but after loosening and tightening it snapped and I had to replace it.  That was a \*lot\* of fun I didn't think I was gonna be able to re-use the existing hoses/clamps but it worked out.  


I did notice that there was no heat in the interior with the heat all the way up which made me think ""clog"".  I went ahead and shot water through the core from the upper core hose and water came out.  After that I left the hose disconnected so I could see if water came up the pipe to it.  Had him start the car and water came out.  Since I ordered another OEM thermostat I went ahead and drilled out the valve so it was fully open and as the engine got to temperature coolant gushed out of the radiator indicating an overheat.  Even though I saw water being pumped to the heater core I went ahead and ordered an OEM water pump just in case it is partially failing.  


The jiggle valve on the OEM thermostat we removed was working properly.  The new thermo comes today and I'll verify it.  I'll update the thread and try the squeeze technique again as I didn't do that this last attempt.

I personally LOVE Project Mu HC+ (hypercarbon+), but know quite a few isF guys at the track who run carbotechs so im inclined to give them a try because ive watched them turn rotors glowing orange and not fade or melt üòÇ. 

Project Mu hc+ are fantastic, though! For both worlds tbh. Great on the track ( i can run 8 laps hard with O fade), and they are still good on the street when they aren't hot. You dont need to drag your brakes when you leave the driveway in the morning to warm them up.

 If you like spirted street driving with maybe 6 track days a year, go project Mu hc+.  If you looking to shave 10ths off your best lap times and dont feel comfy braking any later, go for the carbotechs.

Edit: i run stock akebono rotors. They last, dont crack, and resist warping really well. Imo stock akebono rotors (that come with g37 sport), and upgraded pads. Save money on rotors imo.",infiniti

"Fluid drain and refill is a lot cheaper than a new transmission. And should be done anyway at that mileage for sure. Also double check that the TCM has the latest software. There was a bulletin on that but they don‚Äôt always check if the owner doesn‚Äôt complain about how it shifts.

In my opinion, you are 100% safe to have the fluid changed. Might even be a little early mileage, but not age wise.

"That‚Äôs not true. But just changing out those speakers on the Bose system probably isn‚Äôt going to sound good. You need speakers with the same sensitivity as what he‚Äôs replacing, at minimum. Even then it‚Äôs going to be hit or miss. These cars have amps and head units that are tuned to get the most sound possible out of those speakers as cheaply as possible. Only replacing a few speakers in the car is going to probably be disappointing. If you want an upgrade from the (I think) 13 speaker system that‚Äôs in there, he needs to get an 8 channel amp/DSP and replace the 8 speakers he will be powering with the amp and disconnect the speakers that aren‚Äôt running off the new amp. As long as he gets decent stuff it will sound a lot better with those 8 speakers than it does now with 13, even more so if he adds a sub and separate sub amp. He needs to plan on spending at least 5k to make that happen though. 

I have a 2017 Infiniti Q50 and my current 6 speaker/sub sounds a hell of a lot better than the factory Bose.

* a successor to the FX37 / QX70, I would be very OK with a plug-in hybrid or even an option for a full drop in VR38 from the GTR¬†


* a really, really highly high trim QX30, but all Nissan; hybrid four cylinder? Straight up VR30TT? Whatever, but make it *worth* the orice tag, with much better quality of materials. This could have been the other ""cool"" Juke, aside from the Nismo.


* a modern G20 would be cool, but I think an update to the Y34 M45 would be more ideal. A hybrid V6, with electronically assisted suspension tuned for passenger comfort a la Lexus 400? A new V6 or V8 specifically made to operate smoothly, efficiently, and quietly. Nissan had the President sedan, we in the US never got anything remotely close to that. This could be Infiniti's chance to re-introduce themselves again as a contender for JDM luxury comfort cruisers.",infiniti

All of the VR30 engines before about 2020 are prone to many issues like turbos going out and coolant seeping into the blocks requiring the entire engine to be changed, many of them are done under warranty by the dealership but it is a pretty big problem. Look up porous block issue VR30. They also have problems with the DAS, direct adaptive steering system in the earlier models that have the tech package. No, the Q60 is not faster, it's actually heavier than your sedan and the 3.0tt makes less power than the VQ37 in your G",infiniti

Basically, it locks and then winds up the belt even tighter, id have turn off the car and restart it for it to release. Its called a seatbelt control module, i believe .

**Please note,** I, nor Infiniti, nor Reddit, endorse the *stand your ground comment* and the contents here are **not** legal advice. If you get in legal trouble for shooting someone, then it is your fault, not /r/infiniti's, not mine, and not CAguns_Burner's. Consult a lawyer, not reddit. That said, the post has good info about stolen Infinitis. 

> .....
> I debated whether or not I should make a post and decided that, ultimately...knowledge is power and this will likely inform more people and do far more good than any harm. I also got really tired of people still asking ""What should I do to prevent my car from getting stolen?"" and most answers not really being sufficient.
> 
> So, here's the main points i'll cover with the Infiniti-theft epidemic:
> 
> ### The methods
>
> 1. Key fob signal relay attack: Many people believe that Infinitis are being stolen using the ""relay"" method where thieves are using a scanner + signal booster in a 2-man team ..... While a viable method on many makes/models, and a method covered extensively on social media, this isn't at all that common since the equipment/man power needed is more than required for the next method, which is THE primary way Infinitis are stolen;
>
> 2. Key fob cloning. Fob cloning works because Infinitis inherently use their own onboard software to pair a key fob in the first place. If you ever have an issue with your key needing to be re-pair'd, this is usually a guaranteed trip to the dealership because they use software called the Nissan Consult, which is run by connecting to the car's OBD port. When a dealership service team uses the Consult, activity is logged so there is a trail of who programmed keys to a specific vehicle. The Consult is also needed because they need the ECU codes to talk to the vehicle to get the vehicle to accept the programming of a new key.
> 
> The fucked up part is...**this Consult software has been cloned en masse onto third party/bootlegged tablet devices** and are readily available to buy if you know what to look for. So, thieves have the same (actually, more) power as a dealership to wipe and reprogram a car's key, so long as they have access to the car's OBD port to hook their tablet up to. These bootlegged Consult devices are the main cause of this heartache due to how accessible they are.
> 
> .....
> 
> The reason tablets are ""allowed"" to be used at all by the software is because it gives a way for legitimate (trained, certified) locksmiths to reset a key without access to a dealership. Yes, technically, any locksmith has the same power to steal an Infiniti as any thief does with a bootlegged Consult module .....
> 
> ### How thieves target cars
> 
> This one doesn't need much explaining but there are known groups that will go to innocuous events like Cars & Coffee, etc, to scope out/case cars and then tail the owner home to assess if the car is being garaged, etc. Others aren't as involved and they're just crimes of opportunity .....
> 
> What do they actually do once they've cased a car/owner?
> 
> Well, the most popular method is to use the sunroof/moonroof to get in the car during the actual theft. Oftentimes these thieves will use a center punch tool to easily shatter the glass. They climb on the car, drop through the moonroof, and voila. As long as they have access to the OBD port, that target car is as good as theirs in under 2 min. They connect their tablet, follow the prompts on it (which are automatic and bypasses codes needed by the ECU to allow the reprogramming of a key) and it's see ya.
> 
> The sunroof/moonroof is often used for two reasons: a) it makes it look less sketchy when a passenger or driver side window is punched out when they're driving a stolen car, and b) breaking the glass there doesn't trigger the alarm.
> 
> ***Ways to defend against getting your car stolen:***
> 
> 1. Garage, garage, garage. I know it's not a realistic option for many people depending on your living situation, but a garage really is the safest way to protect any car that fits inside ..... **I'm also not a lawyer, this is not legal advice**, but pretty much forcing thieves to have to break into your house to go after your car means you can use some method of ""force"" to defend yourself if your life is in danger. What's the fifth Pirates of the Carribean movie called? ""Dead Men Tell No Tales?"" Yeah, i think that's it.
> 
> 2. The other, **near-foolproof way is a kill switch**. This should be a 15 minute job by a competent (and trusted) mechanic with $10-20 worth of equipment. It can be a simple switch that's hidden and interrupts the fuel pump, starter, etc, unless the switch is pressed before the car is started. There are third party kill switches as well (like the Ravelco, which is actually legit despite some Russian propaganda site called ""Ravelco is a joke"" or something that takes an absolute shit on it) where they use a proprietary plug to interrupt multiple circuits and makes it impossible to start the vehicle no matter what without their secondary physical device plugged into the car. It's costly though, at like $800 for the equipment and install. This is personally the route I went, full disclosure, and i've had zero regrets. There are other viable and much cheaper options for sure, i'd encourage everyone to do their own research and make their own informed decisions.
> 
> ### Other ways to at least buy you time:
> 
> 1. A club. Yeah, it's a joke of a device that can be cut within 5 seconds with the proper tool, but maybe **paired with a brake pedal lock** there's a good chance thieves cannot be bothered and will just move on. Honestly I still use a club even with my kill switch depending on where I park my car. Deterrence in layers is always more effective.
> 
> 2. Remove the starter relay under the hood. Most thieves aren't gonna carry an extra relay on them, but this is definitely inconvenient if you have to do this every time you drive the car.
> 
> ### If someone does break into your car but is stopped from stealing it cause you had a kill switch:
> 
> It's still $$$ to fix your likely broken moonroof/your keys will absolutely not work because the thieves still wiped your key during the reprogram attempt/you'll have to have your car towed to the dealership or you call a certified locksmith to reset the key for you.
> 
> You are certainly still out hundreds of dollars, but you still have a car, especially if you're not smart enough to be paying for comprehensive coverage on your insurance.
> 
> ### If someone pulls up and steals your shit using a tow truck/trailer
> 
> GG.
> 
> ## Addendums, since i've received some PM's about these
> 
> ### How useful are AirTags/GPS trackers?
> 
> Honestly - marginally useful. I feel like, if you're at this stage where you're relying on these devices to track your car, you've mostly already lost. And I say that as someone who used his own AirTags (planted on multiple locations on my car) to track their stolen Q. 
> 
> ..... Are they worthwhile? Yeah, to a small degree. But they absolutely shouldn't give you a sense of comfort, cause if your car is already gone you're relying more on luck at that point than any location tracker to help you. 
> 
> I can't speak to a subscription service like LoJack, since i'm just not super familiar with those. But the goal is to NOT have your car moved/stolen in the first place; cause if that's already occurred, you just don't know what condition your car is going to be in even just a block away from where you had last left it.
> 
> .....
> 
> ### What do I do if I have a tracker/my car is found abandoned after being stolen?
> 
> Assuming it's not the cops themselves calling you to tell you they found it, call the cops immediately, so that they can remove your plate from the stolen car database and also immediately call your insurance and take care of that noise (i'm assuming you made initial calls to these places to report your stolen car when it first happened, obviously). Make sure not to move the car until cops arrive, don't even take pictures or video until there's police presence there in case your car is being watched/the area is unsafe.
> 
> I can't deny the number of stories i've heard/read about of people finding their own stolen car themselves then calling the cops to their location to force the issue of recovery. In general I would advise against this unless you feel it's safe for you to do so, but again, not a lawyer so it's up to the individual's risk tolerance here.
> 
> As an aside - Infinitis aren't the only cars susceptible to this. All other make/models of Nissans on the same software are susceptible too. Do a Google search on Nissan GT-R forums where this was being done to GT-Rs all across Texas at one point. Same exact methods as what's used for the Q's. Just don't hear about them as much because people that can afford GT-Rs generally have garages, lol.
> 
> Nissan/Infiniti aren't doing jack shit about this, by the way, even though this is certainly a major software design problem. Dodge had the same issue with Challengers/Chargers but fixed it by offering an option to permanently lock their modules on their cars to only a particular set of keys and can't be reprogrammed without a $1k replacement module that has to come from the dealership. Don't ever expect Infiniti to do the same.
> 
> **TL;DR, keep your car in the garage. Make thieves fuck around and find out, but on YOUR terms. Get a kill switch installed. Those really are your ONLY options. 3d printed OBD locks and relocating the port isn't gonna cut it and it's mildly infuriating seeing people repeatedly suggest this on this sub.**",infiniti

It degrades over time and can be detected by checking the oil pressure at least. Have oil pressure checked by a mechanic before purchasing if you are afraid of that (there are youtube vids of the #s you are looking for psi wise).

 If it does need to be done,it's best  replaced with the revised/upgraded part (available at z1,  and then the issue is pretty much solved for good. Cheap parts, heavy labour. Usually, it can be done  for around 1400-1800 ish american pending on what else is needed/worn when going in there (water pump, guides,worn pulleys,w/e)

 The vq37 is super reliable aside of that one issue ,which can be addressed.  Also the stock rubber rear bushing on the diff tends to go pretty easily (you can easily inspect it), but its not a big deal and you just replace it ( and the others if you wish) with better & stiffer bushings from whiteline which are pretty cheap anyway.

Also its worth getting S since it comes with the bigger akebono brakes (it is a heavy car, so the bigger brakes are nice imo and quite good, especially if you put better pads on them later).

I wanted to do the Infiniti cold air intakes on my Q60 and decided not to after calling a few dealerships and reading this.

Edit: I did have the Infiniti resonated axel back exhaust installed on my car because I wanted it, and it was the least likely to be the cause of some car issue and thus run into warranty issues.

So, I kept driving it. Only once did it actually not run, and that was just because it needed an alternator. 3 1/2 years that thing took me through mountains, coasts and even through the icy winter of Michigan briefly.

"So the hybrid battery is definitely not a DIY repair. Very high and dangerous voltages are involved and quite a bit of disassembly to even get to it. The battery itself from the dealer is around $15k+ not including labor. On this battery though there are individual battery packs that are serviceable, so It would really depend on if you could find a shop experienced enough to service the battery instead of changing the whole thing.

If the hybrid battery dies the car is pretty much dead in the water, to many things run though it to be bypassed. As your first jump into the luxury car market, I feel like this car would be a bad choice. Unless you get a very comprehensive extended warranty that will cover the battery this could get expensive really really fast.

All things considered, I very rarely see a battery failure on these cars. The usual point of failure on this car would be transmission concerns, and being that the transmission has the hybrid controls it is sold as one piece and is not serviceable at a dealer. The transmission alone is $10k-$12k not including labor.

"1st gen G35 sedan came with 260hp. They uprated the base engine after 2005 to 280hp. Only the 6mt coupe sport model came with 298hp. These motors are the DE motors. They are notorious for burning oil. I would avoid unless price/condition/maintenance is perfect. 

The G35hr sedan with G37 body has 306 hp. All G37 sedans have 328 hp. I strongly advise paying extra for the newer body G35/37 sedan or a G37 coupe. Much more moddable platform, and more supply of parts. They are also better built and equipped on the interior vs gen 1. If a car has a bunch of mods, assume it's been abused/clapped out. 

Look out for underbody rust, rattling cats, check engine or warning light, any jerkyness on full lock turns, overheating, fluctuating or high idle, oil leaks. Muffler deletes = owner beat on his car. Most of these cars have seen a body shop at least once, so look out for bumper-to-hood gap or signs the airbags were replaced, mismatched paint, etc. New headlights or bumper conversion sometimes are collision cars.

 Sport models give you like $6K worth of extra upgrades over a base model, it's like a different car. X models are nice, especially with the navigation package. Base models are still decent and well equipped.",infiniti

> Here‚Äôs the rub on ‚Äò16+ Q50 turbos. The factory air boxes and air filters are grossly insufficient for the volume of air that flows through them. They‚Äôll be completely clogged in about 10k miles. Add to that it seems most people, including the techs that work on them, can never seem to get the air boxes closed properly. This leads to massive amounts of dust and sand getting directly pulled into the compressor housing, chewing up the blades. This was easily the most common reason we‚Äôd replace turbos.
>
> Secondly, the factory PCV systems are awful. They‚Äôll dump oil directly into the compressors, and it‚Äôs very common to call it a ‚Äúleaking turbo‚Äù by, let‚Äôs call them, ambitious technicians.
> 
> I‚Äôve seen a few legit blown turbos where I couldn‚Äôt definitively say was either crappy air filter design or PCV system oil residue, but not many.
>
> I had a good customer who had installed the AMS (Infiniti) intakes before delivery and later did a Mishimoto oil catch cans and amazingly he never had a turbo issue (worked on that car regularly for 40k miles, and he‚Äôd go to the Tail of the Dragon at least once a year with it, so not a garage queen).
>
> So, the turbo issue is both overblown but also a legit issue. Totally depends on if the owner was aware of at least the airbox issue. If you‚Äôre looking at one, make sure both the lower tabs on both air boxes are seated properly and not broken and there is no gap around the box housings. If you see aftermarket filters (oem are red), see a gap, or there is a ton of debris/dirt it‚Äôll there, those turbos are probably ‚Äúbad.‚Äù You‚Äôll have to remove the big duct to look directly at the filters to do this (easily removed). Also, when driving one, you‚Äôll hear turbo spooling noise, but it shouldn‚Äôt be a high pitched squealing type noise. Especially shouldn‚Äôt hear it at idle or before full boost, but to the untrained ear that may be difficult to determine.
>
> Aside from turbos, another thing to look at is under the oil cap. Any sign of a whitish residue is a hard pass. I‚Äôve done a couple engines for ‚Äúinternal coolant leaks.‚Äù Never figured out how it happens, but apparently coolant leaks from an internal passage and can destroy the engine. These engines consume coolant normally, so definitely pay attention to the coolant level of whatever car you look at (RH reservoir if looking at the engine from the front). If it needs to be topped off really frequently (like, weekly), it‚Äôs likely a victim of that internal leak. I guess ask the previous owner how often they top off the coolant level.
> 
> The 10k mile oil change is the absolute limit for that engine, and any breakdown of the oil will cause damage (like coolant intrusion). If I had a VR power car, I‚Äôd go right back to the old 5k oil service interval. So be careful of ‚Äúwell maintained‚Äù cars, as the factory recommended service intervals are, in my opinion, too far spaced out.
>
> They are good cars to mod, but also consider doing an aftermarket warranty just in case. It doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôll be throwing AMS turbos and a built bottom end at it any time soon, so for the basic bolt-ons and a tune they make great power, and if you have an issue, most warranty companies will still cover the engine and turbos (if they‚Äôre not super picky, so do some homework on which to get). A good aftermarket warranty is also good in case you get the transmission killing P0720 valve body failure, another common issue with Q50/60s.

If you're insisting, go with the G37. they are mechanically VERY similar with the main differences being in exterior design. I would get a cheaper G37 or even better a V36 G35. The 07-08 G35 has the same body as the G37 but has a VQ35HR and 5AT. While slower, I honestly miss the smoothness of that car, the 7AT feels a lot more clunky.

I stuck with the BF Goodrich Sport Comp 2AS+, or the Bridgestone Potenza 980's. The M37 doesn't need Pzeros or the like.

Most all tire shops can program your TPMS's on the spot, it just requires them to basically do it while the tire is off, so just do it all both at once.¬†

With any kit, the key is protecting your work afterward. It does come with some clear liquid stuff you apply carefully line by line with a little sponge (do not go back over your previous lines, or it will muck up, btw)

 But honestly, the best thing is a nice ppf film over your headlights when done! Can replace it whenever down the road, and you can even get ""self-healing ppf"" that can resolve miner scuffs and scratches just by being in the sun.

For the flex pipes being damaged, mine were clean, 2 years later they were a little damaged. Car was taken care of, no harsh roads. Over time these are prone to fatigue and corrosion due to heat rainwater water and dirt on any car.

There's only been 1 instance where it was so low it didn't even read on the dipstick, that was when the car was still new to me and right before I needed to do my first oil change, I didn't know I needed to check it regularly. 

Other than that, the 08-09 had problems with the dash cracking and bubbling/melting and a couple of small wiring issues which sometimes made the windows, locks or audio/nav stop working.",infiniti

Edit: I've seen Level10 site and valve body needs to be sent to them for them to repair, so that would place me without car for 2-3 weeks :( as I'm not in teh US",infiniti
"For a vital brake component, I feel strongly about OEM and new if available, rebuilt if not. Maybe I‚Äôm the wrong person to ask, but used would make me nervous.  
What‚Äôs the part number for what you need?  
Ask the parts department about their service department parts vs retail.",infiniti

"If you ever like to do the odd lapping day at the track ->
Bridgestone potenza RE71r (RE71rs:new replacement for it). Might be overkill if you dont do occasional track day, though.  

On a lapping day, these will keep gripping harder, while your Michelin 4s will start overheating and letting go after a few laps. Great tire that will keep you doing detours to your favorite offramps on every drive, lol.",infiniti
