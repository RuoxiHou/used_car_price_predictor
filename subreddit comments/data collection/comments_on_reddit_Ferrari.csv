"‚ÄúSimple physics,‚Äù my guy you don‚Äôt know simple physics so it‚Äôs pretty wild for you to double down. Thinking that hitting an oncoming car is worse than a wall means you haven‚Äôt been through the first week of a basic physics course. Also, you literally misquote me, I said the same speed you‚Äôd rather hit another car oncoming than a pole. 

The opposing car vs a pole is because of the length of the time of the impact and the tendency for another car to push away. When two cars strike each other, the cars often bounce off each other (sometimes strike more than one time) and less of the vehicles energy is directed into the vehicles and is instead expended as the vehicles move around. 

A pole is the opposite for many reasons. First, it‚Äôs braced into the ground and if it doesn‚Äôt break that‚Äôs very bad. A vehicle going into a pole is worst case scenario because it efficiently expends all the energy into the vehicle and doesn‚Äôt lose any energy to movement, etc. The collision is shorter in time and the energy is directed to a fine point, both of which do maximum damage to the vehicle with maximum intrusion, often ripping the car apart and going through the passenger cabin. It‚Äôs the same principle as a knife; it cuts because the edge is small which directs all the force to a point, creating extreme pressure at that point. 

Compared to hitting a pole or tree, hitting an oncoming vehicle at the same speed straight on with the full benefit of two objects designed to hit into each other is relatively safe. A pole or tree exploits the weaknesses of the crashworthiness of the vehicles design.",Ferrari

Some seriously rare and valuable cars, it must have been a big time collector. The MC 12 is amazing and so is the sergio and then there's what looks to be a 599GTO and a 599 SA aperta?",Ferrari
"If you drive it daily you‚Äôre going to be stopping for gas every other day. I had 3 FF‚Äôs and they are very thirsty, pretty much have to refill every 150 miles or so. 

If you can afford a 599 just get a cheap daily for convenience and use it when you want. It‚Äôs kind of a hassle to take this on short trips and the engine won‚Äôt even be warm by the time you get there. Like the grocery store is 2 min from my house so how does driving there in a 599 make sense when it won‚Äôt even get past 4k rpm on the way? 

I also agree with whoever said it wants to be driven fast which isn‚Äôt very daily friendly. The FF was a bit lurch-y at low speeds in traffic because it wants you stomp the gas pedal. Haven‚Äôt driven a 599 but imagine it‚Äôs similar.

"That‚Äôs a fair perspective.  Personally by the time I go to a dealership my research is already complete.  To your point for me it‚Äôs more about THAT specific car. 

And my offer will be dependent on that.  My perspective is - the seller should be trying to prove to the buyer that the car is worth the asking price, for me part of that is the drive.  Knocking that out the way first saves a lot of time.  We dont need to go back and forth on logistics if I know from day 1 this isn‚Äôt the car for me based on the drive.

But again I see your point.  Honestly there‚Äôs not a ton of data you ascertain on a short test drive but I like to do them early as a red flag check.  Dealer claims ‚Äújust look at the carfax‚Äù but any experienced buyer should know you can‚Äôt trust the car is good off of that alone.",Ferrari

There were several iterations of the car, with some subtle differences in louvers and such, but the pics don‚Äôt allow for more precise time of production. Value is whatever someone will pay, as a lot of these cars value can come from provenance and race history, so it is hard to say.

"I agree, early Mondials were neglected due to different reasons. 
Mondial 8 lacked power, tarnished probably for many the perception of later model series such as the 3.4L T
On the other side I find easily 
348 for 50 K to 120 K
F355 for 75 K to one for 200 K
F360 for 60 K or 300 K
308 GTS 60 K to 120 K
power wise my 3.4 L Mondial T can easily keep up with the 308, 328 or 348, models from similar years. 
So it boils down to individual taste. I like also the Urracos, Espadas, Lagondas, of the world.

"My approach is a little different. I would only ""test"" drive a car that I've already throughly researched and decided on. The purpose of the short drive is to verify the info I've already acquired and not to try to decided which car to get. If it's preowned, then I would want to drive that particular car to make sure nothing weird is going on with it. If I'm ordering new, I might do a short drive with their demo. 

I think the test drive should be the last step in the vehicle purchase process and not the first.  This is similar to buying a mattress. Folks go to the store and spend 10 minutes trying different ones for an item that they will spend one third of their life on. What kind of insight will 10 minutes of testing provide? 

Just my own POV of course.",Ferrari

"I am not rich and certainly cannot afford any Ferrari. But looking at how the USA is adding about 1 trillion to its national debt every 100 days, the stock market just keeps going up,  and inflation is getting out of control, it might be a better idea to sell what you have now and just wait for the rug to pulled out from under Ferrari and other exotic car dealers. The next major financial crash that's looking to probably start in 2024 sometime, will make 2008-'09 crash look like a stroll in the park on a sunny afternoon. Let them come to you, begging you to please buy their new F250s, Sf90 XX they have on their lots collecting dust.  I know it sucks that they hood-winked you, and made you look like a fool. Screw them.  Flip the script on them and wait until tables have turned because its coming. Its so obvious that the current market is not sustainable. Plus in the future, if this dealer  still won't budge, there will be plenty of other out of area dealers that will gladly give you their F250 allocation.

Doing so allows you to build rapport with the dealership.

came out to be $330K. Not worth it, better to buy another used one. I tried seeing if I could repair it elsewhere but came to the conclusion that it will be at least $100K, with lots of surprises that could shoot this up way more. Ended up selling it as is.",Ferrari

"Going 60 to 0 mph over x distance and y time is the same regardless of what you're hitting if x and y are the same in either case. If your heavy wall is going 60 mph towards you, you're now doing 60 to -60 which is worse. That is similar to going 120 to 0.

"Here's what CHATGPT says btw.

Sure! Let's delve deeper into the physics of both scenarios:

1. **Head-on Collision:**
   - When two cars collide head-on, the kinetic energy of both cars adds up. Kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity, so even a small increase in speed results in a significant increase in kinetic energy.
   - The force experienced by the occupants of the vehicles is directly proportional to the rate of change of momentum, which is the product of mass and velocity. In a head-on collision, both cars experience a rapid change in velocity, resulting in high forces acting on the occupants.
   - The impact forces can cause severe damage to the vehicles and can lead to deformation of the car's structure, potentially compromising the safety of the occupants.

2. **Car Hitting a Stationary Pole:**
   - In this scenario, the car's kinetic energy is solely dependent on its own velocity, as the pole is stationary and does not contribute any kinetic energy to the collision.
   - However, hitting a stationary object like a pole results in a sudden and abrupt deceleration of the car. This rapid change in velocity generates high forces acting on the occupants.
   - The damage to the vehicle can be severe, as the entire force of the impact is absorbed by the car's structure. This can lead to significant deformation and potential intrusion into the passenger compartment, increasing the risk of injury to the occupants.

In summary, while both scenarios involve high forces and energy, a head-on collision between two cars going 60 MPH typically results in more severe damage and higher risk of injury or fatality due to the combined kinetic energy of both vehicles. However, hitting a stationary pole at the same speed can also be extremely dangerous due to the rapid deceleration and high forces experienced by the occupants.",Ferrari

"I own a Portofino M and an 812, and I've extensively driven the F8 both on the track and on the street.

The F8 excels on the track as it is a mid-engine car, whereas the 812, with its front-mounted engine, is heavier and more of a GT car. However, the F8's engine sound is absolute dogshit. Really, really poor sound for a Ferrari car. 

In contrast, the 812 is more practical, and its engine delivers the best sound imaginable. It's truly mesmerizing. With a Novitec exhaust, the sound is absolutely brutal‚Äîunparalleled. The naturally aspirated V12 is the essence of Ferrari. It's the real deal. You simply can't go wrong with a naturally aspirated Ferrari V12 (in contrast with the f8 you get a twin turbo V8). 

Opt for the 812. Remember, you buy a Ferrari for the engine, and the 812's engine embodies the quintessential Ferrari spirit.

"My opinion is thus   tune and modify a ford, audi, VW, SEAT etc but exotic cars like Ferrari, Aston Martin, Lamborghini, Porche  etc have been designed, created and engineered to perfection, therefore its deemed as an insult to redesign, deface or re-tune these cars. In Enzo's eyes, Ferrari is a brand of perfection, and there is no need for anyone to change this . If you should even suggest a change, Enzo and his ""Ferrari"" brand will blacklist you. For example, the life long fall out between Enzo and Ferruccio Lamborghini!! It is a Ferrari purchase agreement of a new Ferrari that you do not modify or change, deface or debadge within the first ex amount of time, or you run the risk of being blscklisted and a cease and desist order.

In automatic mode it shifts like a tractor. In manual mode in normal driving it is like a manual. Driven hard it shifts fast and with a brutality that is missing from the DCT and it feels intense. It has rev matching and some other modern stuff, but it also will roll down a hill if left in neutral, so it is sort of a weird bridge between a manual and a paddle shift gear box. So, it is slower and worse than the unit my 488, but I think it is actually more engaging to drive.",Ferrari

The 812 is totally different to drive than the F8. It's a GT car where the F8 is a sports car. Both are very quick, but I prefer the screaming V12 soundtrack, especially through the open top of the GTS.",Ferrari

I‚Äôm in the process of buying a late 60s 365 GT 2+2 in the same blue as my Mondial (I have a thing for old blue 4 seater Ferrari), but when it comes to proportions, I think the rear of this one is definitely more odd than the Mondial.",Ferrari

Like any situation, it's impossible to describe without knowing the specifics, but odds are also the Ferrari was going faster and was lighter, the other car (if they hit a car) was likely going far slower but was heavier.

"Have you tracked a proper race, street-illegal car like a GT4 clubsport (I ask because I see you tracked the street-legal version, the standard GT4), or a Ferrari challenge? Emotions on pure track oriented cars are unparalleled. 

Road suspensions, road tires, all the added weight, make a road legal car suboptimal for track racing. Cost wise, but also sensations and performance wise. 

Sure, the 812 is a missile in the straight, but while cornering you can feel all the weight bouncing around. 

Also: tires, brake pads AND discs will get worn out quickly if you track it hard enough during a reasonable amount of time. And replacements are expensive. Tracks are made to push: if you don‚Äôt end up on the gravel at some point you are probably not pushing hard enough. A proper track car is just a tool made for that, and fixing it and maintaining it will be orders of magnitude cheaper compared to a street legal 812. 

Finally, consistently tracking a street legal car will make it lose a lot of value. A race, track-only car? Not so much.",Ferrari

It‚Äôs also a matter of what questions you ask. If you‚Äôre there primarily to test drive I can also see why they deny. I went in with specific questions about comparing turbo lag between the 488, Artura, and 720s and they offered without me asking to let me drive all 3 (they had an Artura test drive unit on hand).

"Was it an actual Ferrari dealership?  Alternatively, was it a third-party dealership that just happened to have a Ferrari for sale?

If it's the former, then I'd just visit another dealership.  If it's the latter, then visit an actual Ferrari dealership.

In preparation for a visit, call that dealership in advance to set up an appointment for a viewing.  As well, if you have enough funds to buy a vehicle outright, then either send them or bring a proof-of-funds letter.  Ask the dealership for their wiring instructions.  At the end of the call, casually slip in that you're interested in a test drive.

What all of that does is convey that you're a serious buyer who isn't out to just kick tires.  Calling ahead to schedule an appointment displays a modicum of respect for everyone's time.  The proof-of-funds letter serves to signal that you either have enough or more than enough funds to cover the purchase.  Asking about the wiring instructions reinforces that latter point and provides notice that you're serious about wanting to pursue a sale and thus being prepared to follow through with one.",Ferrari

But I think most/many owners routinely leave their cars connected to the tender as best practice when they're not being driven, particularly since I guess most Ferrari owners will garage them overnight.

When mine goes back in the garage at night it goes on the tender every time.

I don't know whether this is true, but I was told that the battery is used faster than a ""normal"" car because of the tracker that is installed.

"A bit late to the party but perhaps a different perspective since I own and run a supercar dealership. 

It's hard to know who's a serious buyer and who's just trying to get a joyride. People play all sorts of games with us to try and make themselves sound like legitimate buyers only to immediately be disinterested after a test drive. Happened to me just this past weekend. 

Guy acted interested in a f430, asked to see it on the weekend so we set up an appointment. He came in, looked at it for only a minute or 2 then asked to test drive it. Against my gut feeling I agreed. He proceeds to flog the car pretty hard so I take him on the short route. We get back to the shop and he let's me know that ""it's harder to drive than I expected"" and that he'll think about it. I follow up Monday and guess what? He's not interested. 

The other thing is insurance. Do you have a policy that can actually cover the value of the car? Most first time buyers don't. Our insurance is extremely expensive and highly restrictive. One of the owners of the company must be in the car on test drives for example. 

We made it our policy that we only give test drives after we have a non refundable deposit. That pretty much weeds out all the BS. I know other dealerships that do the same. 

I think honesty will get you the furthest. If you've never driven a Ferrari, say so. The seller will appreciate that and understand your situation better. Ask them what their policy is on test drives before scheduling an appointment. Remember, nobody accidentally drives by a Ferrari dealer and suddenly thinks hey, I should buy a Ferrari today. 

I don't really care about proof of funds but having a prospective buyer let me know how they plan to pay is always a good thing. In fact, people who are all too eager to prove they can afford the car are usually tire-kickers. 

Remember these are really expensive assets that are easy to damage so the sellers are going to be very protective. Nobody wants to deal with a wrecked Ferrari. I have, and it's ugly, expensive, and nobody has a good time.",Ferrari

I absolutely love my Roma. However, if you're going to cross shop a front engine v12, then perhaps a F12 would be more your liking. 

  
Either way, good luck and good health on your journey.",Ferrari

"IMO the 458 sound is in a different league when compared to the F8. 

488 was bad, F8 is as bad or worse. 458 was the last Ferrari V8 with a good sound (and it‚Äôs fantastic). The current cars with a NA v12 (812 and Purosangue) are the only modern Ferrari cars with a good sound. 

I still do love my Portofino M for its practicality, comfort and looks. But sound-wise the twin turbo V8 is pathetic for a Ferrari car. It‚Äôs not the engineers fault, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs super difficult to comply with regulations about particle filters etc while giving some character to the engine.",Ferrari

But if that‚Äôs how things work at this level then so be it.  I just wasn‚Äôt aware.",Ferrari
"It's more common than you think in the exotic and sports car arena.  A lot of the advice others shared is sound. There's just a high level of risk and accountability with fast and expensive cars that come in to play and the dealer has the responsibility to go through a vetting process. 

I know this isn't your case,  but if someone is just wanting to test cars out to see if they like it,  I highly recommend seeing if there is one on Turo to rent for a day or 2. Then you get the real sense of the car before dropping that kind of money and having regret later",Ferrari

The gearbox itself is a re-engineered GM unit and when I had one it was bulletproof. Lots of fun if you drove it correctly. It was even user-serviceable with generic GM parts. 

The auto in no way has the drama of a gated manual and I could see that if it was your only Ferrari then it‚Äôd be lacking. But it wasn‚Äôt the extent of the car and a lot of owners tend to have something else in the garage. 

I had a 456MGTA and loved it. Kids in the back. Cruised all day no problems. Usable as a daily - the more you drove it the happier it was.

"Thanks for chiming in!  Your perspective as a dealer is super insightful.  And it‚Äôs understandable that dealers would do everything in their power to minimize risk and protect an inventory of assets that expensive.

But I think your points also highlight that at the end of the day- allowing/disallowing a test drive early in the process is essentially a judgement call.  And again, I understand how that may be a tough call to make for a new buyer prospect given there are so many posers.

With that‚Äôs being said, I‚Äôd argue that it should be on the dealer to tease out the information they need to feel comfortable, while also making the perspective buyer feel comfortable.  

This entire thing from the test drive, to the price, financing, etc is a negotiation.  Just saying ‚Äúno you can‚Äôt do that‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem like a good strategy to me (maybe it is though?).  In my situation, it means the dealer missed out on a potential sale of a unit that has been sitting on their lot for 100+ days.

Ferrari usually has a clause that you have to buy from dealerships that are only a certain distance from your residence. I believe this is to discourage predatory pricing among dealers so that everyone can make more money.

Agreed on all counts. My best friend has one and it has an LM wing on it and it‚Äôs simply breathtaking now matter times I see it. Just amazing,Ferrari
"I said I understand your sentiment, now I say I agree with your sentiment. I always wished cars like the senna gtr, aston valkyrie, essenza v12 and other hypercar-based race cars could actually be used in a series and I wish they would bring back GT1 so these cars could have a home. That being said, I don‚Äôt think that makes them any less of a race car since they‚Äôre built for that purpose. I guess you could call it a track car, but it‚Äôs the same difference to me, just one isn‚Äôt following the rules to get into the series.",Ferrari

Im pretty sure that I can't get an F250 right now as well. I agree it was naive on my part to think I could reach hyper status in 2 years time. I was offered 812 comp at 2M at first. Amazing car and will probably be worth more in the future but I can't justify paying that much in overs. Especially when I won't get a hyper.,Ferrari

"The 458 was my dream car for a while until I drove one. It was a 2015 spider and I was underwhelmed. I owned both a 488 spider and just bought an f8 tributo and they are both superior in all ways except for exhaust note. If you drove an f8 and 458 back to back, it is hard for me to believe you would hold that opinion. I still love the 458, but it would have to be owned in conjunction with my f8 whereas I am totally content with the f8 being my only f-car",Ferrari

"yea of course a track only car is always going to be better than a road car, but being track only makes it more complicated to own (even driving on track could get complicated unfortunately given all the sound restrictions at laguna seca, 812 already needs a 103db+ day). i‚Äôll get there some day, would definitely be great to have something like that for driving on track! but in the meantime driving road cars on track is a good in between. 

as for the value, for me it doesn‚Äôt matter. if i buy a car i want to use it. i think my few times on track will do less to reduce the value of the cars than just the mileage i‚Äôm putting on them. i‚Äôm not doing crazy number of track days, maybe 5 days a year in the GT4? and in the 812 it‚Äôs even less. but either way i‚Äôm not worried about that, just want to enjoy the cars‚Ä¶",Ferrari
