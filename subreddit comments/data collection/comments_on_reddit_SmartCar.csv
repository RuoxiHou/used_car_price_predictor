Thanks.,SmartCar
How do you get the cover off the ignition system with out breaking it? Is it screwed in or clipped in place? Got another link? Thanks.,SmartCar
"it does feel similar to a bearing being loose but only occurs when the car slows or during braking, I'll see what I can do! 

If by pulsating you mean like a vibration, there is a slight amount of that, before I got the brakes replaced it was significantly worse. So if I'm guessing correctly from the information I've gathered, it's an issue with the front brakes? 

As for the clutch actuator I'll give lubrication a shot, I might need help finding what to buy/how to do it. 

Also I'm assuming if I'm reading correctly that you're saying to change the lubricant on the transmission? I'm still slowly learning how to figure all this stuff out, so if you can point me to any helpful YouTube videos or anything I would be super thankful.",SmartCar

"When the roadster came to market in 2003 some owners put together a document on maintenance in german. It‚Äôs called JHWUS - Jetzt helfen wir uns selbst. Latest version was 2.5 I think? You can surely download the PDF document for free somewhere in the internet and use google translate if you don‚Äôt speak german. I have no deeper technical knowledge of cars but this manual is so easy to follow that even I could do many things - as long as you have the space and tools needed. 

Have fun and if you lower the motor first check what maintenance should be done as well (spark plugs)‚Ä¶",SmartCar

"It is very impressive, I'm 6ft (\~1.8m) tall, I never had space issues and it was comfortable for long journeys and roadtrips. The Smartmods arm rest bracket, along with a T4 arm rest, was an essential mod for me. It made a huge difference when cruising.

I would get another if I could have it with a proper gearbox and a faster steering rack. I'm currently enjoying an MX-5.",SmartCar
"No worries thanks either way! After talking with some time shops, one of my local Fountain Tires helped another smart recently by unstaggering the tires in order to get 175s in all four corners for winter tires. Sounds like the front wheel had enough space to fit nice and snug. As they won‚Äôt charge us if they don‚Äôt fit we‚Äôre going to at least give it a shot.",SmartCar

"So I have my dashcams (front and back) wired up to my battery through a fuse tap and they can run for about 2 days without the car being started before I need to start it to recharge the battery. 

Out of my dozen plus times of being hit about 8 of them were with my car parked and me not even near the vehicle. Dashcams caught it all. Out of those 8 hits, 7 of those drivers were uninsured and all 8 ran without leaving a note.

Adapter thickness would depend on the particular wheel. I'd rather use an inflator kit for emergencies to get to the next tyre garage. The adapter idea makes no sense as you will only find rims where you find tyres as well.,SmartCar

"I find you can actually go around bends and turns at quite decent speeds; you can feel when you're approaching the limit quite well through the steering wheel, and the first sign after that is slight understeer. The car will let you know what you can and can't do well in time üòä",SmartCar
"In my previous band I got my long scale bass, 12 inch combo amp, the guitar player, the guitar player's amp, two guitars, and clothes and stage gear, and occasionally the drummer's breakables into my smartcar.

Instead of taking a spare/adapter. Why not just get one of the inflator kits with foam?,SmartCar
Yes there is a market. Especially as we can‚Äôt get them new anymore. I have a spare set in the garage so I can paint and swap them out as I wish.,SmartCar
"On my 2019 ForFour, this happened a few times and then eventually, the car refused to charge at all.   From a layman's view, the charger circuit refused to synchronise with the charge point and gave up.   The failed part is the controller for the charger, and it costs..... a few thousand US$ (note.. quite a bit over 5),  way way too much.   My choices are fix or scrap.  Tough choice.  Still struggling in my mind, the car is still in the workshop.     Lesson #1 on EV repairs: there are few parts in an EV and they are all (very) expensive.",SmartCar

"I've had my smart for about 7 (almost 8) years now I've run into much of the same abuse from truck drivers. I find it's worse in any southern states. 

I've made a few modifications to my smart that have been very rewarding. 

1. Bumper spikes. My smart has been rear-ended more than a dozen times. Usually just little taps from people parking or people on their phones and not noticing their vehicle is still moving when at a light. Since installing the spikes I've only been hit once and they originally tried to pick a fight over the damage to their bumper but they ran when I pointed out that they rear-ended me on camera....

2. Dash cam. Evidence is everything. Front and rear cameras are most preferred. 

3. Highly reflective sheets on the backs of my seats. These reflective sheets bounce back high beams back at the offending vehicle. It may sound dumb but a lot of drivers in modern cars have their lights set to ""Auto"" and their sensors adjust whether the brights are on based on the light they sense. The reflective sheets have made a huge difference in the amount of blinding lights I get hit with. Don't get me wrong I do get a some jerks who still manually blind me but it makes a difference.

You're right though that there are people who purposely go out of their way to bully these cars.",SmartCar
"Retired mechanic/technician and service writer for a National Service Center . It‚Äôs not that they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù do it, it‚Äôs more they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù want too.

"I got the atoto obd2 reader. For the harness I bought a obd2 extension and swapped the perm live and switched live pins on the connector (pinout is on evilution). This turns the obd on and off with ignition and keeps the dongle hidden out the way under the dash. 

I also bought a 4g WiFi dongle paired to the head unit and hid this under the dash on switched live from the fuse box so my head unit always has WiFi.",SmartCar

Your smartcar has lost its memory for the transmission (three lines) - put it in Neutral turn the ignition on and hold the brake pedal until you can see N in the gauge cluster. Without N or P the smartcar will not start.,SmartCar

"we dont have them here, but i doubt its a good **car**

a good car can move stuff along with people. my fortwo has minimal storage space and i trade it to a family member whenever i need to move anything substantial. i can get a saloon, suv, or pickup truck pretty much any time so i can easily buy ""bad cars"". my other car is a 2017 Toyota 86, which arguably has less storage space than my fortwo.

bright side: no one ever asks me for help moving house
down side: no one owes me that favour, lol

my first cars were sedans. they fit 4 (5, technically) people and still had a trunk for stuff. i always suggest a cheaper beater sedan as a first car. they're awesome and can be good fun.

im not sure about the coupe, but my toyota 86 is absolutely horrendous in snow. beyond terrible. im very curious to hear what others say about the coupe in the snow. i find the fortwo to be amazingly stable and planted in the snow. i have snow tires on it.

a pro is that it should indeed hold its value, its made of plastic so it wont dent, and shopping carts can hit it no problem, and it'll be pretty good on gas.",SmartCar

After 20 years the Sam is also suffering now of cold solder joints, if they didn't already you may have to resolder to be sure it will not fail you on the road

Beside the problematic Sam the engine runs very well (mine has nearly 200.000km) if serviced correctly

I dont really see it that difficult to find any parts I need. Most things are readily available. AutohausAZ sells a lot of original smart parts and rock auto also has many options for it.

"It was ridiculously easy, so much so that I was surprised! I just flipped the front brace upside-down and the seats happened to align almost perfectly. Used a vice grip and some elbow grease to bend the rail‚Äôs mounting points until they aligned with the car‚Äôs and used the stock bolts and an impact to re-secure everything :) I used a pair of fuse jacks to wire them in and I believe I used a 15amp mini fuse, maybe 20?

Technically it was up until I made my way back and about 100 km away from my home. The car completely broke down.

No car is ""safe"", it's all a sliding scale. Is the Smart as ""safe"" as a Peterbuilt? Nope. Is it safer than a motorbike? Yes. All vehicles take damage in an accident, and you might find that although a crashed Smart will look like a huge wreck, the reality is that the Tridon cell is *incredibly* strong. It's like driving in a sphere, and we all know how strong a sphere is. 

Smart are proven to be safe vehicles, far beyond what you would expect for such a small car, and we that frequent the sub are satisfied (and impressed) with their safety record. We have done the research, otherwise we wouldn't trust ourselves and our families with these incredible cars.

Note* - There are several different methods and this is one of them. 

‚ÄúIf you get the three bars have you actually re tough the transmission? Just get in the car shifter in park. put your foot on the brake, put key in and turn to on possession. Do not turn the key to the starter position and if you do turn key off wait a few minutes and start again. Ok so in park keep foot on break whole time, turn key to on position dash will light up three bars will flash just sit there brake pressed and do nothing for a few minutes. You should hear some clicking under the car which is the actuators going through the gears. After a few minutes the three bars should return to
""P"" and then you should be able to start the car like normal.

The gearbox is a bit of a compromise, it's slow and not much reactive but you learn to compensate it, the problem is not the gearbox itself but the clutch actuator who needs to be serviced too (remove it from the car, dismount it, clean it and relube it with white grease) making it last a lot longer then you read on it online

"Well actually google the Tridion safety cage, might surprise you...

""One of the major problems with very small, light automobiles is that they can be unsafe in a collision. The Smart solution is the Tridion steel safety shell. This hemispherical steel ""cage"" encloses the interior of the car and also forms the bulk of the Smart's chassis. A small energy-absorbing crumple zone at the front of the car lessens impacts, and the engine lives in the trunk of the car instead of the front. While a 1,500-lb. car will never be as safe for the occupants as a larger vehicle, the Tridion shell holds up remarkably well in crash tests. A 70 mph crash test conducted by British TV show ""Top Gear"" revealed that the Smart Fortwo's body remained mostly intact when compared to that of a conventional subcompact car. A sudden deceleration from 70 mph will cause injury of the occupants in just about any vehicle.""",SmartCar

I noticed your car doesn't have paddles, mine didn't either but I retrofitted the paddle shift wheel. Another mod that really improves the car, you notice the slow gearbox much less when you are just flicking the paddles. I followed the Evilution guide to swap it over and adapt the wiring.

I found that the paddles were a little too small, [3D printable extensions](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3073223) help to make the paddles more usable. If you go this far I would recommend printing them from PETG as they can warp in the sun if printed with PLA - I know this from experience!

"It would be easier to get the tyre replaced on the rim rather than trying to source a new wheel and tyre somewhere regardless of stud count. I believe the only safe way to do it is replace the hub or get a milled adapter however I believe you would need to do both sides if you needed to change the hub for safety so by the time you have got both hubs in storage you would be better off putting a spare tyre behind the driver seat. 

However it‚Äôs not that easy as front and rear tyres are different sizes and widths so you would need 2 spares. Hence why foam is the best option. If you get a larger blowout that foam won‚Äôt help recovery can tow you to a garage to replace the tyre. The only time you would need a new tyre and wheel is if you broke a wheel.

Reach in (under trunk) and rip that sucker out, see if it can be popped open. No orange wires? No high voltage.

Another point: I went and got an iCarSoft MB II scanner for my 2018 Smart Fortwo EV (453) and found it displays a TON of information about the car's systems - including detailed info about the control/status of the onboard charger.

I have seen center caps such as this Italian flag themed [set](https://smartmadness.com/start-shopping/exterior-upgrades-smart?product_id=300015448).,SmartCar
"Q&A time!!

1: About the gearbox: Yes, the gearchanges are slow compared to a Dual clutch, but they're not as bad as it sounds. I never drive my car in automatic mode, because the programming for the gearbox is unpredictable, but if you drive it in manual mode it's fine. Hit shift, it disengages the clutch, and while upshifting takes away throttle, changes gear and then reengages the clutch in less than a second. When downshifting it leaves throttle enabled, so you can rev match. The only thing that sucks is skipping gears, going from 4th to 2nd takes a bit.

This is something that can be changed though. An upgraded clutch actuator and a chip tune will run you about 200 euros, but make a huge difference. I haven't done it yet, and I'm pretty happy with how my car drives, but it's pretty easy to improve.

&#x200B;

2: The two spoke steering wheel is pretty big. I'm 1,77m tall, and I fit well, but my friend who is 1,90 something can't sit comfortably because his knees touch the wheel. 

The tree spoke wheel with paddles is a bit smaller, so that problem is improved with that one. You can also upgrade to a brabus steering wheel, if it isn't brabus branded it's ""only"" 500 euros, and the wheel is even smaller.

&#x200B;

3: All of the roadsters I've seen / driven do have power steering. Considering the car only weighs 800kg it's probably not all that bad without, especially with the large 2 spoke wheel. The power steering is ok, but not super responsive, if you really want that road feel no power steering might even be more to your taste.

4: The oem softtops are prone to shrinking, which leads them to leaking. If you want to upgrade/replace the soft top make sure you don't buy an original smart roof, because those suck. Aftermarket roofs are pretty good though.

If you check the car really well you should be able to find any possible leaks. Generally the roof is only leaky in really terrible sideways rain and car washes. The side mirrors and air intake up front can be unreliable and leaky though.

The SAM is a combo of fuse box and ECU, and it sits above the pedals. If water gets into your dash itll drip down onto the sam and kill it.

Very important to note: the early cars are much worse than the later ones. Mine is a 2015 model, so it came with the fixed mirror holders and better seals.

&#x200B;

I'd look for a car with around 100k, and if you trust the seller then above is ok too. A replacement engine will cost you 1,2k so if your engine blows up it's not the end of the world. 

It's incredibly important in this car that the car was driven calmly when cold, and that the previous owner(s) let it idle for a bit to cool down the turbo after hard driving.",SmartCar

"Dealing with car problems can be extremely frustrating, especially when the model is no longer sold or officially supported in a particular country, solutions seemingly elusive and resources for assistance limited.  But saying ""never seen such a misleading community like I have for the Smart Car"" is as misleading and below the belt as it is just plain naive.  Why aren't you mad at the mechanics that you're talking to?

It's rather simple:  most people who buy Smart cars aren't usually tinkerers themselves.  The Smart brand was designed and built in Europe and meant to be city cars in Europe.  The concept was for customers to take them to official, authorized Smart auto garages (together with Mercedes) and have them maintained there.

Most run-of-the-mill mechanics in the U.S. aren't known to be lovers of tiny, foreign-made cars either, for a whole host of reasons.  But you expecting ""the Smart Car Community"" (whatever that is in your mind, since you're officially a part of it by your logic) to be your go-to error-free mechanical advisor is bullshit.

It's true that some Smart car forums and websites require membership or payment for certain resources.  Why would you expect everyone to do things for you for free? And it's not like the various forums cost thousands a year to join.

Ultimately, every car model can have its quirks and challenges, and it's important to do thorough research and consider potential maintenance and repair issues before purchasing any vehicle.  Personally, I'd never buy another 451, but I've always loved my 453 and still do.

Anywho, I'm sorry to hear you've reached a point where you'd toss your Smart car into a junkyard.  But you won't be the first nor the last to do so.  And there will be plenty of other eleven-year-old cars of OTHER brands there--of manufacturers which still have active operations in that country--when it arrives.

It's always a difficult decision to part with a vehicle, especially after investing time and money. If you do decide to move on from your Smart Car, hopefully, you'll find a more suitable vehicle that meets your needs without causing you as much frustration.",SmartCar
"Ah, we just tried disconnecting the negative terminal and then reconnecting it back up but no dice with the problem unfortunately. Is there another place to check for the grounding? That thick brown wire looks to be in fine condition too.

Steering wheel isn't locked.,SmartCar
"More tips: Even some Professional smart specialists don't know what they're doing, so it might not be worth it to buy one from them over getting one from a private seller.

I got mine for 3.9k, the previous owner took great care of it and changed his own oil regularly.

Try to get one with paddle shifters. Those steering wheels are much smaller, better looking, and an upgrade from a two spoke to a three spoke with paddles will cost you about 400.

There were a bunch of options that were unnecessary too imo. Cruise control can help, but the footwell is so small you don't really have anywhere to put your feet when you are using it.

Don't pay extra for a good standard stereo, they all suck anyway. Invest in a good aftermarket head unit and some decent 13cm speakers instead if you're into audio. The stock stuff sucks anyway.

Check the softtop when buying, they tend to shrink in the sun and stop being waterproof and folding correctly. Don't buy one without having tested the roof.

Feel underneath the carpets in the footwells and behind the seats, if it's wet walk away.

if the stock speakers are still in the doors and they sound rattly that means water has come in through the mirror holders in the doors. Not the end of the world, but definitely something that should be looked at, so it might be a good negotiation tactic.

Sounds like a loose connection somewhere because it works sometimes and others it doesn‚Äôt. You‚Äôve checked the motor and it works the resister is new.

"I have had one for years, great car, lot of fun. My advice is don't get one unless you have a second car and you really, really like working on cars yourself or you've got a mechanic who's geared up to support abandoned MB products. The car itself is a decent car and reliable, but they're getting a bit dated and MB has abandoned them which means parts on an already niche market car as well as maintenance will be harder to get and you may well have to wait a few weeks for parts to arrive from overseas, which is why you'll want the second car.",SmartCar

Failing that part out yours and buy another. Parts for a 451 are becoming harder to find so you should have no problem selling. You will make more if you sell it in parts rather than as a whole.

"Hi!

&#x200B;

My second car is a smart roadster, my first doesn't really count though, as it was a peugeot that never ran.

&#x200B;

These claims about it being impractical are only half correct. I drive my Roadster almost every day, and a lot of the time I have a passenger, but I'm almost never in a situation where I would need to bring another person with me, so a two seater is rarely less practical than a four seater.

The coup√©'s trunk isn't all that small I've gone on a weekend trip with my girlfriend, and the rear trunk wasn't completely full, which left an empty frunk that also  holds a good amount.

&#x200B;

Gas mileage is pretty good, mine gets about 5,8L/100km, but I do drive really aggressively all the time.

&#x200B;

My university is in a very car unfriendly city, so the roadster being so tiny really helps with finding parking spots that work.

&#x200B;

I can definitely recommend getting a hardtop for the winter, because it's more likely to be dry and warm. If you're really lucky you can find one with both. Upgrading a hardtop to a softtop and the other way around is expensive and difficult. Do keep in mind though, that if you have both the softtop will always be taking up space in the trunk when you have the hardtop on it.

&#x200B;

Don't let people mess you up about the engine. Mine is running great at 130000km, I know people on their first engine and gearbox pushing more than 300 000. It's super important that you change the oil regularly, and don't overfill it. More than 50% on the dipstick means you're risking your engine blowing up, more than 100% and it almost definitely will.

&#x200B;

It's a car that requires a bit of attention to be driven regularly, but if you're ok with that it can absolutely be reliable if you buy a good one.

&#x200B;

If you have any questions feel free to dm me. And don't take advice about that car from people who have never owned/driven one, those are the people who talk the most but know the least.

Once you buy one you can also join the international smart roadster club, They've got a telegram group with 700 members who always help out if you have questions, there are big meets a few times a year, and they generally offer each other replacement parts first before putting them on sale online. Definitely worth it imo. 

&#x200B;

After that I will research your links, so thanks for that!I am totally not a car guy. I have no experience with cars and maintaining it myself. I do however want a somewhat sporty, affordable and cheap car. The roadster is very unique and cheap to drive, and I like that. I was looking at a Smart Roadster Coup√© because it looks the best in my opinion.

About these steering wheel paddle shifters. I have heard that switching gears with these will take a second. What is your experience with these? It looks really cool but I have heard that the mechanism isn't for everyone. The fact that you need to wait a second before the system changes gears can be quite annoying.

With regards to the steering wheel, I noticed that the size of the steering wheel is quite big. Is this annoying or is it just a thing you get used to?

I have also read about Smart Roadsters often not having power steering. Is that true? And if so, is this an obstacle? This ofcourse is subjective, but still.

About the hard/softtop. I have heard about leakages going through the roof of the car, mostly with a softtop. I also read about water leaking into the dashboard from outside, water leaking inside the doors and potentially to the SAM (whatever that is). What is your experience with leaks? Do you have less leaks with a hardtop? And how do you test the roof? Just by simply opening and closing it with the button or by pooring some water over it to see if it leaks?

Lastly, what about of kilometers should I look for when buying a Smart Roadster. Is 200K too much? Or more towards 100K?

"First of all - do not open the coolant cap when your engine is hot. Due to the layout of the rear mounted engine you can cause the coolant to boil instantly by releasing pressure and this will cause air in the cylinder head. 

It is normal for the smart to heat up when standing still with a running engine  - the front fan will start at approx 100-105*C to lower the temperature to 90-95*C. 

To be sure that everything is fine with the cooling system, you can bleed the air out of the engine at the hose left handed on the cylinder head - the system is not able to bleed air by itself.

As for the alignment the only real adjustment is toe. Which would happen without braking. The camber and caster doesn‚Äôt really affect the pull to one side. They should have given you a print out of the alignment results? If not then who knows what specs they‚Äôve gotten it to.

It‚Äôs a very simple cable system which spins an adjuster that puts pressure on the shoes on the inside of your rear drums.

Mm, from a private seller at the time. Before my 09, had a 10. Had to replace the muffler to the tune of about $400. Plus tires, batteries, wipers, the usually stuff. Then it died at about 100k(ish).

Also (even though) the transmission is supposed to be filled with lifetime lubricant 75W-90 GL-4, I would see about changing it anyhow. It may be low due to the axle seals leaking. This has been an issue with the lagging in shifting.",SmartCar

"I hate when people who don't know anything about this car start criticizing it.

Yeah, you can get a big comfy sedan as a first car, but if you're driving back and forth to uni a lot generally you don't need the back seats, the gas mileage tends to be pretty bad because they're heavy, and they're hard to park.

The roadster has lots of weight in the back, so I haven't managed to get mine stuck yet. ESP works pretty well, so if it's on you struggle to spin the wheels even when it's really slippery. With it off the thing can drift like crazy though. Mine has some pretty good all season tires on it.

The coupe easily has enough space for day to day stuff, I drive it often with my girlfriend, and our backpacks, jackets and everything else have enough space in the rear. The frunk was designed to hold a crate of beer and a backpack, so there's enough space up there too.

Buying a big car just for the few times you might need it sounds like poor logic to me. My roadster is in the cheapest insurance class, cheapest tax bracket, gets incredible gas mileage, and is super cheap to repair.

For my type of work the Smart has been a blessing. I do lots of driving and parking around the city, where the tiny proportions but big spacious cabin have been great. I also love the split tailgate for perching on during the summer to have a quick picknick.

"2019 EQ ForTwo from the USA here!

To unlock the charge port on the vehicle itself, it's the same unlock button for the doors inside. Right in the middle of the dash, between the air vents, above the Hazard lights button, is where the lock/Unlock button is. It's the full central locking button. It will lock, or unlock the entire car. You can also do it with a door open, to cycle the whole car. It will lock, then unlock the whole vehicle. 

When I return to my car after having locked it, one unlock button press, will only unlock the driver side door, leaving everything else locked still. Two presses will unlock the whole car. 

That said, mine has never paused or stopped charging when either locking or unlocking the car. Maybe yours is slightly different, I am not sure on that. Have you tried using the key to only unlock the driver side door instead of the button?

"If you're in the US, we never got the 3 phase upgrade for charging. Likewise if you're across the pond, many models had it available as an option for a while before eventually becoming more mainstream. The top end of the US and basic models without the added 3 phase charging, is a maximum charging of 7.4Kw. vs 11-22Kw (or more). 

Chances are your Smart doesn't have 3 phase charging. So only the normal ""level 1"" (120-220v) or ""level 2"" (208-240v) charging is all it has. Level 3 is largely considered fast charging

https://www.evchargingcablestore.com/smart-fortwo-charging-cables#:~:text=Charging%20cables%20that%20are%201,that%20your%20vehicle%20can%20accept.

In essence, if the car is charging fine with the included slow charger, then it should be ok using a faster level 2 charger. Which consequently means it working as intended.

Now if you do have the upgraded charging and it's not working, then something is still wrong. 

That said, I for some reason remember hearing that Mercedes has to reset the computer or have it re-learn the new battery when it gets replaced in a Smart. So maybe that is it too.",SmartCar

New wheel will be significantly cheaper than the proper repair and refinishing of the damaged wheel.  Even with the MB tax new wheels will be cheaper.  If you can grab a salvage set of wheels in good condition it‚Äôs an even easier choice.  Good luck!,SmartCar
