"Your first step is to join the Lincoln discord. 

That’s where all the social group planning takes place. 


For example, a group of 20+ of us in the discord group are going to Daffodil tomorrow to celebrate Persian New Year by eating Persian food for lunch, and then a bunch of us are doing a bar crawl for St. Patties day festivities in the afternoon. 

On Sunday we’ve got a potluck at one of our discord members apartments.

"Lord have mercy. There’s so much wrong here.

A 223 bullet does not tumble with impact. Not any more or less than other calibers. That is a myth. Lol. Oh lord I’m going to continue.

The penetration can absolutely cause massive “”””””collateral damage”””””””””””””” since you love quotes. A small 223 can exit through a 4x4

Go outside and shoot an AR and a 12 gauge. 10/10 times you are going to have your ears ringing from the AR. Decibels or not the sound from an AR is chaotic. That’s from tens of thousands of rounds shot from both. Anyone knows this who forgets their ears.

Ok last. Pistol calibers are more often than not going to have higher muzzle velocity. Twist, grain in powder, bullet and case design are the reasons. I need to check my reloading manuals but I bet 95 percent of pistol calibers go below 2800 fps. Some of the big bores that are super hot may go faster with a long barrel.


Bro you bit on this conversation and failed hard. I had a gun range at my property and reloaded for years. I’m not here to make anything up.

To boil it down. If there’s people you love in the house you are going to have a shotgun over an AR. The JM series is a 10 or 11 round semi auto that will send a man to hell before he hits the ground. Way less terminal velocity than a “”””””non-tumbling””@@“” 223.

"I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, I see people all the time befuddled as to why a homeless person is turning down food or gas or what ever it is item that you are giving them, instead of what they are asking for, money.  The reason they are turning it down, is the fact that homeless people have access to food. There are number of emergency food places that homeless can get meals and food at, churches, all kinds of thing. They aren't panhandling to get food money, and they shouldn't be grateful to you for giving them something they didn't ask for.

The houseless person is very likely addicted to something, and that something isn't something they can get at a food bank or soup kitchen.  You are getting dirty looks after offering them things they didn't want, because they aren't hungry, they are in withdrawals and food isn't going to take those withdrawals away.  And look, I understand not wanting to support a junkie or alcoholic with their addiction, but it's not more virtuous to offer them something they don't want instead.  Just tell them no, and walk past them, don't waste their time because you want to feel good about yourself for seeing through the elaborate rouse of ""money for gas"" or ""help an army vet""",lincoln

Bully breeds were bred and inbred for many generations for fighting in pits. Some are still bred for this. Selectively bred for aggression.

These types of sites still track the breeding for fighting except they call fighting ""game"".

https://game-dog.com/threads/smith-waltons-gr-ch-bad-billy.22332/

It's true that you could get a pit fighting dog that is more docile which in the world of dog fighting would be used as a bait dog, would you still be willing to put yourself and your family at risk due to a savior complex and adopt such a dangerous breed? 

Pit breeds make up a small percentage of dog attacks yet over 70% of grave injuries and fatalities.

In my opinion, the dogs have good potential after selectively breeding the bad traits out of them.

Selective breeding works, shepherds are selectively bread to be shepherds the same as Labradors are selectively bred to retrieve. Or how Irish wolfhounds were bred to kill wolves.

We can definitely correct what we did to those poor dogs. It is definitely humans fault that pit bulls and the like are so aggressive and humans should correct that.",lincoln

"De-paywalled:

>The Legislature approved Steve Corsi as the leader of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services on Monday, but debate over the new CEO's work history and social media activity may not be over.  
>  
>Senators affirmed Gov. Jim Pillen's pick to oversee Nebraska's largest state agency on a 28-8 vote that largely fell along political party lines after about one and a half hours of debate.   
>  
>A number of Democrats were present but not voting, as was Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, who is nonpartisan. After the vote, Hunt filed a motion to reconsider the action, but it was unclear if it would be scheduled for further debate.  
>  
>Corsi was appointed by Pillen in August to replace Dannette Smith; he started on the job on Sept. 11.  
>  
>But a handful of senators, led by Omaha Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh, who acknowledged Corsi may be qualified for the position still criticized him for what they described as questionable honesty and professional judgment.  
>  
>Cavanaugh said Corsi's ties to Epiphany Associates -- a Utah-based consulting firm that currently has a $10 million no-bid contract with the state -- run deeper than was originally disclosed.  
>  
>In February, at a hearing of the Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee, Cavanaugh and Sen. Jen Day of Gretna questioned Corsi about his ties to Epiphany, where he worked from January 2023 to days before starting in Nebraska.  
>  
>That information was not included in Corsi's resume, nor was that part of his work history included in the announcement of his appointment from Pillen's office.  
>  
>Cavanaugh said Epiphany — which recommended Corsi to Pillen — was hired in several states where he previously worked, including Wyoming, Missouri and Washington, while he was employed there.  
>  
>She said his financial gain from those connections remained ""unclear and ambiguous.""  
>  
>Cavanaugh also said Corsi had demonstrated ""questionable judgment in his professional capacity"" in at least two of his prior positions, as well as in how he conducted himself on social media.  
>  
>In Missouri, for example, Corsi was receiving paychecks from two departments within the state. Despite pledging to rectify the situation, he continued to receive those payments until the Jefferson City News Tribune brought it to his attention.  
>  
>Corsi was later the director of the Wyoming Department of Family Services when it purchased a restraint chair for the state's boys school. The chair -- a high-backed chair with shoulder, lap, wrist and ankle straps -- received criticism when it was used at Guantanamo Bay in the torture and force-feeding of detainees.  
>  
>According to the Gillette News Record, Corsi claimed to not be aware the chair had been purchased and used during his tenure with the department.  
>  
>And, Corsi had liked or shared several posts on social media in recent years calling race ""preposterous nonsense,"" downplaying slavery, and expressing opposition to same-sex marriages.  
>  
>""It's been one thing after another after another,"" Cavanaugh said on Monday.  
>  
>Other senators, mostly Democrats in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, said the pattern of questionable decisions gave them pause, particularly after the state was still cleaning up the mess left by St. Francis Ministries, which was hired to care for abused and neglected children in the Omaha area.  
>  
>Omaha Sen. John Cavanaugh said that while Pillen had the right to nominate the person he felt would be best for the position, there were clearly problems with Corsi's appointment. He asked committee members to explain their votes in support of Corsi.  
>  
>""I have questions about what it is that got you past these initial concerns,"" Cavanaugh said.  
>  
>Sen. John Fredrickson, also of Omaha, said Corsi's explanations about his work history and social media comments ""left quite a bit to be desired"" when the two met for a face-to-face conversation.  
>  
>Lincoln Sen. Danielle Conrad said the Legislature had the opportunity to provide a check on the executive branch in considering whether or not to ratify Corsi's appointment. She said she was interested in what led Pillen to this decision over someone else who was ""equally qualified but without the political baggage.""  
>  
>Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chairman of the Health and Human Services Committee, told the Legislature he was not concerned about the ""financial end"" of the issues raised by Cavanaugh.  
>  
>Rather, Hansen said he believes in Corsi's ability to lead the HHS department.  
>  
>He also said he found Corsi ""open, accountable and honest,"" which was enough for him to move the appointment to the floor.  
>  
>Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, who in February said he wanted more information before sending Corsi’s confirmation to the floor, said he also believed Pillen’s pick met muster.  
>  
>“I believe the governor deserves to have his team for which he will be accountable,” Riepe said.  
>  
>Other “yes” votes on the committee did not speak on Corsi’s confirmation – nor did any other supporters – before Sen. Steve Erdman of Bayard called the question shortly before noon, forcing a vote and ending debate.  
>  
>While the vote went in Corsi’s favor, Hunt, who did not participate in Monday morning’s floor debate, filed a motion to reconsider the vote.  
>  
>The Legislature did not immediately take up that motion, however. Under the Legislature’s rules, Speaker John Arch does not have to allow the motion to be debated. But if he does, he must schedule it within five days.  
>  
>If it is not scheduled, the motion is considered defeated.  
>  
>Clerk of the Legislature Brandon Metzler said he's only aware of two instances where lawmakers reconsidered a confirmation after it had been adopted.  
>  
>The first happened in the 1970s, according to Metzler, and another in 2023, when senators approved and rejected Jason Hayes as the director of the Nebraska Public Employees Retirement Systems.

You pose the same risk “in the dark” with a shotgun/ pistol/ rock/ or tomahawk or being hard to operate or missing into another room. 2) you talk about the noise of an AR…but you suggested a shotgun?  Shotguns decible level is quite higher than an AR. 3) a pistol, while a great option, has the same issues you showed concern about the AR with.

- Location is great IMO. Right across from a grocery store, the Mill coffee, a yoga studio, and ice cream shop. Also next to Antelope Valley Walking Trail if you like running or walking. 
-Walkable to downtown (either for work, school, or events like Husker football).
- Only utility to pay is electricity. WiFi, water, trash included in base rent.
- No issue with neighbors being loud thus far.
Cons:
- no cats (ESAs are allowed).
- O street can get loud. The fire station is nearby so be prepared for sirens. Not too bad but still.

One of my favorite classes was even a religion elective thanks to a great professor (who's still there!) but unless it's part of the class, religion isn't very present (some ceremonial things with matriculation if I remember right was it). I had great luck with most professors there, and found it academically supportive. Even Greek Life is taking strides there as it takes up a significant portion of the student population, it's worth noting. As far as accepting, I think NWU as a whole would probably be more comfortable than UNL and really most other places in the state. I can't speak to Portland, so I have to imagine it's worse, but depends on your tolerance. For example, when cruising O street is big on the weekends, you can expect to see big trucks with confederate flags on occasion from out of town. I have never witnessed any sort of confrontation from individuals like that at least, they tend to keep to themselves.

Overall, I loved my experience at NWU and lived in Lincoln after. NWU being smaller really does care about each student and I definitely felt more supported there than peers did at other institutions.

"I'm a developmental disability service coordinator with DHHS. From what you're describing, I would strongly recommend looking at the Aged and Disabled (AD) waiver, if they haven't already:

https://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/Medicaid-Aged-and-Disabled-Waiver.aspx

It provides funds for getting paid care givers, among other services. It also comes with a service coordinator (like me!) to help navigate potential services and set them up. The AD waiver is outside of what I do, so I can't really answer questions on eligibility, but it sounds like they may qualify.

It might also be worth checking out Developmental Disability (DD) waivers. I can actually answer specific questions on that as it's what I do, if you want to message me. If they are eligible, that will likely take a bit more time to set up than the AD waiver though, and it also won't provide day services until they're 21 any day LPS is in session, as LPS is considered able to provide care during week day hours. But it does cover residential care.

Modern police serve no purpose for the average citizen. The powers that be just make you think they do.  Police can be charged, found guilty and fired only to be rehired a county away. AT LEAST when a firefighter fucks up (as some LFR people have) they don’t move a city away and start over.  Name one fireman who raped or sexually harassed someone or otherwise broke the law they were sworn to uphold who was fired and went on to be a paid professional elsewhere.

Another crazy thing to think about is how many people apply for certain positions.

"Hello friends!

My name is Vivianne and I am a sophomore English major at UNL. I have a longtime love of furry friends and deep appreciation for animals. I have recently joined Rover, an app that offers bookings for pet care. My schedule is currently wide open and I am looking for work in the Lincoln area! 

Although I am new to Rover, I am experienced in pet-sitting. I grew up around dogs, cats, and fish in my household and frequently pet-sat for neighbors and friends. My current puppy is a 1-year old Cane Corso named Dolly! I have the most experience with dogs, but I can also provide care for cats, rodents, aquatic animals. Since every pet is special, I aim to provide specialized service for every pet. My special skills include administering pills, caring for senior dogs and large breeds.

The services I provide include overnight house sitting, drop-in visits, and dog-walking. For more information, you can visit my profile linked below. I look forward to getting to know your pet!

"I grew up in Beaverton. Lincoln is definitely not Portland, but overall it's a decent place to live. People are pretty live and let live. There are pride flags in people's yards and there are f\*ck Biden signs up too. People are just not in your face either way typically. I've lived in Colorado too and despite being a blue state there were a lot more giant belching trucks with Trump flags than you see here.

Lincoln city politics are somewhat liberal owing to the University and state government here.

One thing (well technically two things) I really miss are the ocean and mountains. I know I'm going to get some downvotes here but there simply isn't as much outdoor stuff to do here compared to the variety the pacific northwest has to offer. And outdoor season is a little shorter here in the sense the winters are quite a bit colder typically. I actually miss the rain too.

I'm afraid I can't speak to NWU. Nor from the perspective of queer/gender non-conforming. Not being religious isn't a problem, but you probably will get some pushback if you are vocal about it (again live and let live).

"HOAs consist of a body of people who have to vote on whether or not to allow/prohibit anything. The amendment process to the covenants is fairly lengthy and difficult, involving attorneys, the county, and, of course, a majority of the board. That, by itself, is pretty difficult! There is no such thing as an HOA ""waking up one day and deciding"" anything, really. If one was concerned about not having a voice in the decisions being made, HOAs are notoriously looking for community member involvement as being on that board is generally not a lot of fun. However, for those interested in protecting their freedoms and avoiding anyone waking up and deciding, as a group, they just don't like dachshunds anymore, it may be a worthwhile expenditure of time and energy.

When in reality there is far more gray area than there is of the solid colors.

"Do you have a realtor?

Here's the dark secret, these realtors know the best homes before they got put on the market and will reserve the good homes from their own realty company for their own employees so the realty company takes all closing fees.

So if you are looking at houses that have already been on the market a few weeks, there are reasons they haven't been snatched up, whether it's because they are a shithole or more likely they are demanding too much money.

Dismissing him as a loser and a weirdo because you decided to look through his comment history to make judgements and bad-faith assumptions about his life— ALL based on a comment he made under a random post suggesting a march to improve the lives of his friends who've been screwed over by a corrupt system— is exactly why so many men in his position end up internalizing what they feel, and either become abusive or kill themselves.

"Step-Up to Quality is the best rating tool for parents looking for quality care. It's run by the Nebraska Department of Education and is entirely voluntary to enroll in*. This self selects out the subpar centers.

Because it is run by DOE and not DHHS, it has higher standards for each step. Any center that is at a step 4 or 5 is going to (for the most part) he high quality. The standards once you get past Step 3 are pretty comprehensive and require conscious effort, upkeep, organization, and planning by teachers and administration. In my opinion, it is a great indicator of quality.

NAEYC accreditation is another thing to look for - however, I've seen claims that their judgements are a bit inequitable and they price out centers that can't afford the fees.

"What you need is get permitting wise is [here](https://outdoornebraska.gov/fish/). At least for most lakes in Nebraska.  There are lakes that have their own fees such as Lake Wanahoo near Wahoo.

Where you can go is [here](https://gismaps.outdoornebraska.gov/portal/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b14f07ac2b7747dbb193fba4b08d2b0b).  That will provide some info on if additional permitting is require and the type of species you might find.

The rules you need to follow is [here](https://outdoornebraska.gov/guides-maps/fishing-guides-reports/fishing-guide/).  It is broken up by lake.  Please review before you show up.  Seeing people using live minnows on a lake that has just recently been restored really irks me.  Invasive species can ruin a lake and it can take years to restore it.  (Wagontrain is just coming back after restoration for example.)  There are lakes that let you use live minnows.  So just read things over before you show up.

Search the stocking schedule [here](https://outdoornebraska.gov/conservation/fisheries-management/fish-stocking-program/fish-stocking-database/) for good information on when a good weekend might present itself.

My personal favorites:

Holmes Lake - Shortly after stocking with Trout (they don't last long) and for its convenience. Its close and doesn't require vehicle permit.

Conestoga - Lots of good shore access points, lots of good sport fish for beginners (Panfish, bass, even some muskies),  bigger fish can be found with a boat and there is a nice boat ramp.

Branched Oak - Big lake for boats, overrun with white perch which isn't great for finding many records but it is great if you want to take a kid and catch fish after fish after fish. The exception for records is trolling for catfish.  Just don't transport live white perch.

Twin Lakes - My favorite for catfish and carp.  Carp is not popular to fish, but pulling in a big carp is still fun even if you just release it. And carp will bite when its hot and nothing else will.  A $1 can of corn out there can entertain all afternoon.

Wildwood - my lake for zen.  Trail that goes all the way around and you can hike out away from everyone else and still find good bites.

Wagontrain - Recently restored, they did a lot of work and should be as good or better than Conestoga eventually.  This may be the year its worth fishing out there even though bigger fish haven't had the chance yet to grow.

Stellantis - Sid Dillion in town is high pressure but otherwise ok.  No room on price.

Toyota - Baxtar in town will push what they have on the lot over what you want. No room for negotiation.  Not much used other than lease returns.

"I did something similar once but not nearly as bad. 

I was trying to find the entrance to a hotel building in Crystal City in Arlington VA, right across from Washington DC and I ended up in the loading dock area behind the hotel instead. When I was backing up to turn around I didn't notice there was like a two foot drop down because there was the beginning of a ramp down to a loading dock so the ass end of the car dropped down and it was quite the shock. 

I stopped before the front end went over to assess the situation and thankfully I wasn't a few feet over where the drop was even worse but then a few feet more there was an actual barrier to prevent drivers from driving off the edge but honestly the barrier should have started right where the pavement split into two elevations. 

So I was looking at my situation feeling pretty stupid and it looked to me like about a foot and a half drop and I kept thinking this thing was just gonna rip my front bumper cover off when I backed the front end of the car off. This was just a compact sedan, there wasn't a lot of clearance and the ledge it was halfway on just looked huge to me. 

After agonizing over it for a couple minutes I resolved to just rip the band-aid off and back the car off the ledge and just accept whatever happened so got back in and reversed the car. There was another big bounce and crunch and then I got out to assess the damage and I was pleasantly surprised to see the car had handled the drop like a champ. The underside of the front bumper did take a scrapping but nothing was knocked loose thankfully.",lincoln

I'll be 40 this year and have been renting since I was 23 and right now is the worst time for consumers. They know they can get away with subpar remodels and flips because if you're desperate enough you will buy or rent. The problem additionally is it seems theres no hope in sight with corporations buying up real estate to then turn into rentals or put it back on the market for astronomical rates.

I'm single and no children, but I've been looking for a home since before covid. I turned my life around started building savings and my credit up and decided it was time to buy a house, realistically speaking I was very close to buying 1 that needed work but was in a great area with a huge yard and multilevel deck. I could have got it for under $200,000 it's like 5 years later and the last I looked it was valued around $375,000. Big ouchie there.

Realistically I don't NEED a house, but I'd like to have my own land and not share a wall with a complete stranger too. While building equity from the property and home as well.

"OH FFS, disingenuous? It's literally in the [description of neighborhood parks from the City of Lincoln:](https://www.lincoln.ne.gov/files/sharedassets/public/v/2/planning/long-range-planning/comprehensive-plan/parks.pdf)

> Neighborhood Parks should generally be located within the center of each mile section with a service area radius of approximately 1/2 mile in the urban area.

All of those parks are within a mile, meaning anyone half a mile from Woods is within half a mile of those other ones.

> Locate Neighborhood Parks close to the center of residential areas and within walking distance of a majority of residents; park sites should be readily accessible by pedestrians and bicyclists

"As a parent of 3 kids and a spouse of a teacher.  Putting kids in early to get them some of head start on school is crazy.  What exactly are you rushing for?  So they can graduate HS at 17 and possibly enter the workforce or even go to college, then graduate college at 21 and then enter the workforce?  Life isn't a race, it's a journey and eventually you end up working the rest of your life anyways.  We have a kid that is a July birthday and will turn 16 before sophomore years of HS and one that was April who was always the youngest.  Looking at how much better things are for the younger kid, makes me realize that it will ild have been so much better for our older kid in middle school and high school having waited.  
To each their own, but as a male, being older in HS makes things so much better.  Not everyone can grow a beard when they are 12, so being a late bloomer isn't an issue if you are 18 entering your senior year.  Plus that extra year of muscle development is huge for success at sports.  There are far more reasons to wait than there are to go early.  Going early is almost always about money and daycare.",lincoln
"Not sure if this is part of the project or not but getting to the pickup point and then getting from the drop point to your destination is part of the reason a service like this would struggle I think. Lincoln has pretty poor public transit, and while it does have a bus system the hub and spoke system isn't very rider friendly, Omaha's works a bit better from my understanding. Both cities are pretty spread out geographically so most people have to travel once they arrive to their final destination. Lincoln's downtown doesn't have that many people working in it either.

Isn't Amtrack more national service and not regional for most lines except a few on the east coast? I see LNK to OMA being more of a light rail regional service.

Time is a big factor too, in many situations I see a lot of these pubic transit options as taking more time than driving your own personal car (assuming you have one), having hours of operation that may not line up with flight schedules, having to grab secondary transit after arriving at the main places etc. To offset that, it needs to be inexpensive (probably subsidized) IMHO. I don't see myself using a service like this at that $40 price range because it's not worth the extra cost or time of driving myself.

I had family that commuted in Chicago from the suburbs to DT via train several days a week. This worked well because they could walk on both ends easily, or when weather was bad their spouse would drop them off at the station on their way to work. They used the time to catch up on emails or do reading. Both traveled a lot for work via O'Hare and it was less expensive and easier (quicker) to take a private car than drive their personal car, pay to park, and the time of parking/getting to the car/terminal, when they could have taken the train, with a couple of transfers and more time.",lincoln

"What's happening (in my limited opinion from what I've seen on tax returns) is that when banking regulations relaxed, and you could get a new mortgage on a newer house while still having an old mortgage on the old house, then a lot of people ""moved up"" and kept their old house and moved into the new one. 

The other factor is that, while it isn't Blackrock, etc., buying up those houses, there are SO MANY LANDLORDS in Lincoln. Especially local landlord management companies and small time investors. Arrow and Kabredlos and some families, etc They have cornered the entire low-end supply and now there is hardly any, and they will outbid you when you try. The bank will happily lend and lend and lend to them whereas 30 years ago, you had to have 50 - 100% cash purchase price if you were getting multiple homes. 

I see A LOT of small time landlords. There are so many here, and while they may not represent the evils of Blackrock, etc., they are an aspect of wrecking the market for first time homebuyers and downsizers, while new builds are all priced out of ""affordable"" range.",lincoln

>if I give a cashier $5 and he gives me two 10's instead of 1's as change and I saw it but didn't say anything, would that be an arrestable offense since he gave it to me even though I knew?

The concept of ""bank error in your favor"" does not exist. It never has. In this hypothetical, the extra $18 you were given is not yours to keep and you would be legally obligated to return it. It doesn't even matter whether or not you knew about the mistake. That money just isn't yours, and it never was. It really is that simple.

That said, when we're talking about amounts this small it's unlikely that as a practical matter anything bad happens to you. Most likely the merchant wouldn't even bother trying to trace down the mistake, and if the police were called, as long as you were willing to give the money back everybody would be very happy to not file any paperwork and go about their day.

Now let's try another thought exercise though, because your scenario only feels like a grey area because the amounts are tiny. Make the amount huge instead and it becomes painfully obvious:

Are you allowed to keep the money if a banker accidentally transfers $100 million into your account instead of $100? No, of course not. It's exactly the same legal reasoning. It doesn't matter if it was mistake. It doesn't matter whose fault it was. That money simply isn't and never was yours. The bank has every right to fix the mistake and claw the money back from your account. In fact, if you learn of this mistake, and take steps to hide the money from the bank in an attempt to keep it, you can actually be charged with fraud yourself. The prosecution has to prove intent here, but that's pretty easy to do in cases where somebody notices an absurd balance in their bank account and then quickly moves to cash out the account and hide the money. There is plenty of legal precedent for this, banks have prosecuted people successfully many times for this.

btw I don't know where you got your info from but Phil Ivey *lost* his case when he was sued by casinos for edge sorting. He appealed it to the highest court he could, which confirmed the original ruling, and he eventually agreed to a settlement after the US Marshalls seized his WSOP winnings. Also that was a civil case and not a criminal case so it's hard to compare that to the free gas scenario in which the woman is being charged criminally.",lincoln

As with all dogwhistles you can't always 100% tell, there's always plausible deniability and the possibility that they just didn't know or were referencing something else.

And just like any dogwhistle, it can be used in earnest by people who then say ""what are you talking about, it's just the number 88 you crazy liberal.""",lincoln

A former LPD investigator has a quote in the journal star saying that he has questions about the handling of the hair but there has been no evidence to suggest it was mishandled or compromised.

The eyewitnesses reported seeing a man with long blonde hair (the suspects hair is light brown) running away from the crime scene but neither witness reported the suspect’s distinctive coke bottle glasses.

> The city will begin replacing lead pipes that connect older Lincoln homes to city water mains this summer as part of an initiative to replace at least 6,000 of them by 2035.
> 
> Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird announced the launch of the initiative Thursday, an effort funded in part by a $32.6 million loan from the federal government.
> 
> The loan is part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which included $145 million to Nebraska for a revolving loan program, said Jim Macy, director of the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy. Hastings, Grand Island and Kearney have also gotten loans for lead pipe replacement.
> 
> Lincoln is eligible to have much of the loan forgiven, and the city will use money it has been set aside in the capital improvement program to repay the remainder of the loan, so Lincoln homeowners will not be responsible for any of the costs.
> 
>The city's Urban Development Department has done inspections on 94 homes and remediated 42 properties using a $3 million grant from the federal Housing and Urban Development, plus another $400,000 grant that allows the city to fix non-lead problems they find during the inspection, said director Peter Hind.
> 
> At an earlier news conference, Elliott stressed that Lincoln's water already falls well below the regulatory limit for lead .
> 
> The city water system itself does not have lead pipes, which means the pipes identified by the city run from private property to city lines. Some homes also have lead fixtures, Elliott said.
> 
> In Lincoln, most of the lead pipes are found in homes built before 1950, mostly from the '20s and '30s.
> 
> The city has identified about 2,000 lead pipes and close to 4,000 galvanized pipes, which run downstream from lead pipes and also need to be replaced. They are still working to identify all the pipes that need to be replaced.
> 
> Because the pipes are on private property, the city will need permission from property owners to replace them.
> 
> Owners of properties that have lead pipes the city plans to replace this year will be contacted by the plumbers the city has contracted with and they'll have to take a photo of their service line, sign an agreement and allow plumbers access to the home.
> 
> For more information, or to look up your own property to see if it has lead or copper pipes, go to the city's Lead Safe Lincoln site.

I would also recommend checking out Southside Boxing. They have a partnership with a local MMA gym (Calculated Violence) and even doing both the cost is half of what you’ll pay at Lincoln BJJ. The big difference IMO is the focus in how they train… Lincoln BJJ is more of a recreational gym (with a competition team) and Southside/Calculated Violence is focused on competition. ",lincoln

"Hey there! 

Strongly recommend going to a physical therapist instead of a chiropractor for a number of reasons. Briefly (and not in total) 1, chiropractic care is not evidence based. 2. There are [health risks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088539240700783X) that come with risks to your health. I’d especially be wary if they were near my [neck](https://www.newsweek.com/woman-left-paralyzed-critical-condition-chiropractor-treatment-georgia-1724376). 3, chiropractors are a bandaid solution, whereas physical therapy can teach you skills to improve your condition with less or no return visits. 

In town, I’ve gone to Complete Physical Therapy for 3 separate conditions over the years. Highly recommend. If your insurance is deductible only, the self pay rate is cheaper.",lincoln

Handle it all over email and I can just forward it each time to whoever I'm talking to.  Walked out every time pretty happy with our price.  Hold off on talk of where your loan is from, and if you are trading and save that for later.  If you have to, get them all to put the trade against one another as well.

It made sense in 2012 when there were lots of homes on the market, if the seller wanted $234,567 for their home and they knew someone willing to pay then they can keep all the fee. It also gives incentive to get a realtor through them so you get inside offers for homes. Lastly, it benefits the seller because they get the home sold at the price they want right away.

The only losers would be smaller realty agencies or independent agents or for sale by owner, which these large realtors don’t care about.",lincoln

"I'd be pretty pissed if you splattered your brains on my car or went through my windshield.

Yes, I'm SUCH a stickler, becuase being responsible for your own life, is totally different than being responsible for the life of an animal, and any other human lives they may interact with.

Five dogs that were poorly trained and poorly contained were just euthanized for escaping and mauling a person who is still in critical condition like last week. This shit gets even worse with nice weather.

And, they were euthanized, because they had already done it once before. I'm sure that person's excuse is the same ""dang my fence broke again those crafty devils!"" 

No, maybe don't own five dogs, or maybe don't own any pets at all, if you can't properly contain them. Sorry not sorry, it's just as disrespectful and dangerous to the animal as it is to other people. An overwhelming amount of people are those who don't have adequate resources to make them truly happy, well behaved, healthy, and safe  other people and pets. If you can't accommodate those necessities, consider getting some plants instead. Skimping on fencing is one of the first corners people cut. 

Sure, your dog could escape out the door, or get off it's leash, but the odds of them jumping, breaking, or digging under your fence while in the yard unattended, are so fucking high with many breeds. 

Saying ""my dog can easily break through my fence and has done it before!"" Is code for ""I don't know how/I don't have the money to properly fence my back yard for the pet I have taken responsibility for.""",lincoln

"I’ve owned six houses in Lincoln. Two had HOA’S. I was even on one of the boards. There are advantages and disadvantages to HOA’S, but I found that most of the problems resulted from someone buying a home without reading and understanding the covenants prior to the purchase. The HOA in the Tierra neighborhood, where I was on the board was responsible for maintaining a lot of commons area, recreational sites and equipment.  There was also snow removal, attorney fees and insurance to pay and sidewalks for exercise away from streets. This all cost a minor yearly fee, but the benefits were substantial and wouldn’t have been available without an HOA. The board there even organized numerous social activities.  That particular neighborhood had an incredible amount to commons area for kids to play. This all seemed like a worthwhile investment to me at the time, and I loved the neighborhood.  But I also understand that this is something that not everyone is looking for, and some may resent HOA’S.  I never found the ones I dealt with to be unreasonable. Each to his own.",lincoln

"Problem is the general perspective on home ownership has become an irrational obsession over it being an “investment,” when homes are anything but. I blame HGTV, the proliferation of flipping propaganda and every Tom, Dick, and Larry doing standardless home DIY.

30 year mortgages and the ease of cash out refis/HELOCs gift people ridiculous credit lines to be indefinitely in debt. I guess owing on a home for your entire working career is more desirable than paying it off at 35.

Plus you have all sorts of gimmicks to keep home prices artificially high. Points buydowns by sellers, which is a backdoor ARM. Gotta give it to people—they will be creative to bend over backwards going into as much debt as possible to live a life they can’t actually afford.

Just when you thought housing prices would crash, the industry invents absurd schemes to get people to pay half a million dollars on a $60k income 😂

I love when people scoff and insist ohhh the Wild West days of the mid-2000s are over. Who are they kidding? You have 7% 30 year mortgage rates on $500,000 homes and buyers/sellers are coordinating point buy downs for 2 years to keep that 7% down to 4-5% because that’s the only way to afford that $500,000 house.

I think some of the nicer apartments in town might do 3-month leases at a premium; you'd need to call around individually to inquire as it might not be openly advertised, but that might run at least $2K/mo these days (extrapolating based on the relative increase in rent, and I know it was clocking in at 130-150% of the longer term rates several years back, anyway).  Also, maybe this isn't even a thing anymore since this town now persists in a moderate housing shortage that likely won't ever recede.

Ah okay I was confused when you first said they buried the temp line as Allo puts their fiber into a mini orange conduit that is about 1/4 inch in diameter so if they had just buried the temp it would not necessarily stand up to the elements and would most likely deteriorate over time. We called burying the line itself a direct bury back in the day. We used to just bury rg6 coax and rg11 for telecoms back when before they started using different conduit pipes to put the cable in to make them last forever.,lincoln

"I mean... I know what you're referring to, but holy cow my man.  Your description is accurate, but I couldn't expect anyone who isn't already familiar with the infrastructure and history of that particular area to decipher all of that or look it up easily.

""Easiest"" access is basically from [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/40.743437,-96.712976), and head southwest ~⅓ mile.  (Yes, there's a railing to crawl through, which isn't explicitly fobidden.)

To elaborate: There are other, ""more proper"" and longer ways to that point through the park, which are much more difficult to describe on Reddit, but are easily determined from maps once you understand what you're gunning for.  (In that event, most commonly you'd start from the Old Cheney trailhead, and taking the correct paths of course, it's maybe a little over 1mi south from there.)",lincoln
"Roper Park has some good views of the city on top of a hill. It's a straight shot toward the capitol from the trail that runs parallel to 180.

Several years ago there were some suicides on parking garages in downtown Lincoln. Anyway, they work for a quick few shots, but if you're doing a time lapse or long exposure, definitely go to a park instead.

"Criticism of ""accident"" terminology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Traffic_collision&action=edit&section=2)\]

Many organizations, companies and government agencies have begun to avoid the term *accident*, instead preferring terms such as *collision*, *crash* or *incident*.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-10) This is because the term *accident* may imply that there is no one to blame or that the collision was unavoidable, whereas most traffic collisions are the result of [driving under the influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence), [excessive speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limit#Excessive_speed), [distractions such as mobile phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distracted_driving), other risky behavior, poor road design, or other preventable factors.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-11)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-13)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-14)

In 1997, George L. Reagle, the Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers of the [Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Motor_Carrier_Safety_Administration) wrote a letter stating that ""A crash is not an accident"", emphasizing that the Department's Research and Special Programs Administration, the [Federal Highway Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Highway_Administration), and the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration) had all declared that ""accident"" should be avoided in their published writings and media communications.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-15) In 2016, the [Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press) updated its style guide to recommend that journalists use ""crash, collision, or other terms"" rather than ""accident"" unless culpability is proven. The AP also recommends avoiding ""accident"" when negligence is proven or claimed because the term ""can be read as exonerating the person responsible.""[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-Crash_Not_Accident-16) In 2021, the [American Automobile Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Automobile_Association) (AAA) passed a resolution to replace ""car accident"" with ""car crash"" in their vocabulary.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-17) In 2022, the traffic management company [INRIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INRIX) announced that ""accident"" would be removed from their lexicon.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-18)

The [Maryland Department of Transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Department_of_Transportation)'s Highway Safety Office emphasizes that ""crashes are no accident"", saying that ""Using the word accident suggests that an incident was unavoidable, but many roadway crashes can be attributed to human error.""[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-19) The [Michigan Department of Transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Department_of_Transportation) states that ""accident"" should be dropped in favor of ""crash"", saying that ""Traffic crashes are fixable problems, caused by inattentive drivers and driver behavior. They are NOT accidents.""[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-Crash_Not_Accident-16) In line with their [Vision Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Zero) commitments, the [Portland Bureau of Transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Bureau_of_Transportation) recommends using ""crash"" rather than ""accident"".[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-20)

On the contrary, some have criticized the use of terminology other than *accident* for holding back safety improvements, based on the idea that such terms perpetuate a [culture of blame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_culture#Arthur_F_Carmazzi) that may discourage the involved parties from fully disclosing the facts, and thus frustrate attempts to address the real [root causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis).[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#cite_note-times69-21)

"That all happened while Fabian Bruskewitz was the bishop of the Lincoln diocese.  He retired in 2012.  He regarded himself a ""maverick"" and was the only ""no"" vote among 285 U.S. bishops at a conference in Dallas in 2002, adopting a zero-tolerance policy.  He said we had it under control here and didn't need any changes.  What a guy...

In 2019, after 7 years under a new bishop, the Lincoln diocese did finally adopt that zero-tolerance policy.  Not sure why it took seven years.  I recall when the new bishop came in, he was asked about it and said he wasn't here to ruffle feathers.  Or, you know, protect people from predators.  Had to be careful not to embarrass Bruskewitz.

Try to reconcile the logic behind not adopting a zero-tolerance policy on sexual abuse.  Still pisses me off.",lincoln

"This is an intuitive take that seems to have formed across many channels.

The interest rates do not ever work like this.  The Fed reduces rates in response to problems.  If there were no problems, they'd leave rates where they were.  A strong economy can handle higher rates, because your wage growth, wealth, and investments would all be growing with the economy.  If the Fed is saying lower rates are needed, they are admitting to lowered growth and stimulus needs.

All that to say... Yes, the Fed has said lower rates are coming.  No, I would not expect inflation unless the government releases spending programs to directly help again.

What is the most likely scenario is that interest rates will be 3% again for mortgages, but banks will not approve those loans for most people, because an economy full of layoffs and job losses will result in a good buyer defaulting in a few years, and they will not want the risk.",lincoln

Unfotunately there is a generation of folks living right now that are just about the ""me"" and could give a shit less about the all the younger generations.

Even if we put our entire profit from our current home into that home, our monthly payment on a new home (including taxes and insurance) would be around 3k/month. 
Not to mention, the erratic home market pricing partially finished homes in the 480k range.  We walked through a new construction home priced at 480k which was fully finished on the main level but only framed in basement....1500ish Sq ft finished for 480k.

If you placed 2 loaves of bread in front of me. One priced at $1.00 and the other for $10,000, you would pick the regularly priced loaf of bread. 

But if you're starving and the 2 loaves of bread are put in front of you priced $10,000 and $10,000.02, and there's 100 people behind you and everyone is starving and everyone starts throwing their money at this bread, two people are eating until the bread is gone. 

This isn't sustainable. Eventually, there are going ro be thousands of people with houses only worth $100k but sitting on a mortgage of $500k. They are going to be screwed.

Future hobby to sign up for: you can learn beekeeping there if you want! 

Head downtown for some book shopping: Francie and Finch is my favorite local bookstore, and A Novel Idea is just down the street from there, with cheaper/used books.

For lunch or dinner: head to Fattoush - the owner is from Turkey I believe. It’s GREAT middle eastern food. We have other knock off versions in town (that I still eat when friends want to go), but this is the real deal. I recommend the borag beef, biryani chicken, and baklava.

If you’re up for some volunteering, get in touch with Lincoln Literacy Council or the Cat House if you’re animal lovers. Those two have a soft spot in my heart!  

If you want to get creative, head to Paint Yourself Silly. You can paint pottery or do a few other crafty things there. Wide range of prices, and special deals on Friday evenings usually…I think one involves wearing your pajamas?!

-Banhwich for their Korean BBQ sandwich
-The Mill for their cold brew coffee (local place with four different locations) 
-402 Creamery for their cinnamon snickerdoodle ice cream 
-Yia Yia’s pizza for the best thin crust pizza around - also a decent beer selection with some fun imports. Pool tables and lots of fun people go there, so could be a cool place to meet people.

"That's a good question.. All previous dental work I had done was with a different provider when I was younger, so I couldn't tell you. However I'm fairly certain i saw him doing fillings or crowns or something on another patient before. I would say just call his office and ask his secretary, Jessica, these questions. 

I would imagine same day extraction could only work if he doesn't have lots of other patients to oversee. Schedules often exist for this reason, of course.

As you say, he may be a top contender. It's hard to say how good any dentist is compared to another. So often the bad experiences are at the hands of the dental hygienists who do the routine stuff. Everyone can also have bad days where a client decides that the entire practice is bad based on one slip up. With that in mind I value my overall experience as well as the attitude and disposition of the professionals. Rick has always been very empathetic while also being very straight with me.

Well, spoiler alert, the Woods Park neighborhood as defined by the city is 33rd Street from O to Capitol Parkway, down to 24th and J, back to O Street. So by that definition, clearly the one Seeing Red wants us to adopt, the people in the Witherbee Neighborhood must not count either.

Our kids went there at that time and we pretty much knew all the teachers, except for the sketchy randoms that were there from time to time.

Like, the kids already have separation anxiety and some of them probably haven’t got the routine settled into them yet of their parents coming back to get them at the end of the day… why do that to them?? 

It’s infuriating. That employee should have been immediately fired on the spot and parents notified of the situation, because it’s likely the rest of the class saw that happen. Why initially give the employee the option of training?

This all isn’t to say bubbles and blocks is bad. We took our kids there for a very long time and the lead teachers were all very good, some of them we hire to personally babysit for us outside of daycare. However, there ARE random, “stragglers” that we used to call them, that would be there from time to time to help watch the kids and sometimes they’d be super sketchy looking… like, we wouldn’t have been comfortable leaving our kids there if there wasn’t a teacher we knew in there.",lincoln

"Some of the companies mentioned here are fine for taking trees down and grinding stumps but I wouldn’t want them anywhere near a tree I intend to keep so I would consider the following when selecting a contractor to take down a tree. 

*They should be “licensed” with the city and on their approved list.  https://www.lincoln.ne.gov/files/sharedassets/public/v/13/parks-amp-rec/lpr-aboristlist.pdf the city’s arborist test is nowhere near as difficult as the ISA or NAA exams and passing it does not require much knowledge of arboriculture. It does mean that they are approved to do tree work in Lincoln and that they are probably insured and may be a fine for a removal. Definitely consider contractors with higher credentials if you are looking for pruning, care and maintenance of a tree. 

*Current insurance to do trimming and removals should be verified. 

*They should be registered as a contractor with the department of labor. 

*Confirm what equipment will be used and how they will be accessing the tree. If they need to drive heavy equipment through your neighbors backyard you might want to consider someone who is an experienced climber and doesn’t need a lift. Another important consideration is root zones of other trees you intend to keep. Heavy equipment and vehicles compact soil and damage tree roots so root zones need to be protected. 

*Confirm that they are licensed to apply pesticides if are using any herbicides to treat a stump (some will do this if they don’t do stump grinding) http://www.kellysolutions.com/ne/Applicators/index.htm

*Confirm that the tree you wish to remove is 100% on your property. There are a lot of shared trees on property lines and you will need permission from the other owner to remove a shared tree. Anything between the sidewalk and the street is a city tree and you will need a permit for removal. 

*Confirm that they will call to have utilities located before stump grinding. Not all utilities are buried to current code and for some reason some contractors neglect their responsibility to call for a locate. 

*Make sure you are provided a copy of a detailed contract that outlines all of the work and any waivers and is signed by both parties.

"I realllyyyyyy dunno what to tell you then, a lot of people swear by the loophole, I mean it does have a literal cult hehe. Hmmmm head scratcher....welp go on cultoffranklin and ask that same question their, ngl you prolly WILL get some hate cause some people there are blockheads that cannot handle a different perspective, however some folks their are more knowledgeable than myself, however here my guesses and its just be taking a shot in the dark and hoping I hit something. 

1. A lot of local flower as I mentioned can be sprayed with distillate and not be 100 percent natural, therefore when you initially take a toke you get a slight buzz because you burnt off the distillate on the top and the rest is literal bunk.

2. This is a LONNGGGG stretch and I promise im not insulting you when I say this like I said, shots in the dark. Maybe a reverse sugar pill effect? In other words in the back of your mind you think ""oh this is legal and I bought it locally so it has to be shitty"" kinda deal, though before you say anything I do realize this ones kinda a goofy guess. 

3. Just bad product, kinda has to do with number 1. A lot of local smoke shops just do not have good product period which is why a lot of people use online vendors such as arete hemp, 8 horses hemp, jk distro, bay smokes etc....as a side note for skeptics id go for arete hemp firstly, because the others are alright but from everything I have personally read on the cult, Arete has very consistent good products.

4. The product is harvested WAY too early in an attempt to comply with the law and in that case their just is not a lot of thc in the product you are getting. 

5. lack of terps, a lot of cult flower (thca flower) is flash frozen to stop the thca from naturally decarbing into delta 9 (not all but a bit) and in doing so that can get rid of a LOT of the terps in the product and leave the high just...very bland unlike full bodied dispo weed where the delta 9 thc content does not matter.  

  
   Those are the best guesses I can come up with, just ya know search around, find what works for you, visit the cult and find vendors that get good reps from others and try those, if you don'\[t wish to mess with all that and would rather rely on a plug, or a road trip that's completely understandable as well, I do not wish to force any product on anyone if they are not satisfied with it. :p",lincoln

“We serve the underserved communities.” Gimme the numbers. How many people served by this plan live in the neighborhoods surrounding the park? How many scholarships are going to what demographics? How many people actually get to access the courts for free?

We extend our sincerest apologies, will remain fully cooperative and assist in any way we can.  You are in our minds first at this time.  We will never move our focus from safety and accountability from here on, we pledge to never hide from this and to take it as a deep and formative lesson.  We know the situation could have easily ended worse, so we are taking a leave of absence to actively re-train our staff, replace management, and adjust our practices and policies to prevent this from ever being possible again in the future.

"Man I disagree. In a home defense scenario, the only reason to not use an AR is if you're worried about over-penetration and live in an apartment. They're the most modular, user friendly, and affordable option. Easy to mount a light on without interrupting the controls, easy to add a suppressor, a tremendous variety of ammunition available, etc. 


Handguns are significantly more difficult to shoot accurately , especially under stress. Adding a light and a red dot only makes them bulky and harder to operate for a novice. Unless you actively carry and train with your handgun regularly, it's a poor option.


Shotguns really shouldn't even be in the running unless you're resigned to using slugs or 00 buck. I wouldn't even bother with anything smaller. None of that scare off an intruder with the noise of a pump action bullshit, that's hollywood. Longer barrels, more difficult to mount a light on, lower capacity, etc.  If you are legitimately in fear of your life enough to pull a gun, shoot to kill and don't play around.",lincoln

"> The defense would argue that by the machine accepting the transaction then that was on the gas station to make sure their systems are up to date

IANAL, but agreed. In isolation (see more below), if this were the use of her own card it wouldn't be much different from having an item ring up for $0 in the self-checkout line. AFAIK, sale price is whatever the merchant completes the transaction at. 

That said, there's this detail:

> Police said Thompson received the card in lieu of payment from a man paying off a car debt.

So she was using someone else's card, which likely violates the card's TOS. Also, it does sound as if the card was a ""master key"" of sorts, probably reserved for technicians doing setup and maintenance. It's a reasonable conclusion that Thompson accepted the card as payment knowing its capability and also knowing that the card was not hers. Thus, the prosecution can prove intent.

The worst part of this for her is if the rewards card backend infrastructure is out of state she could conceivably face additional federal charges.

I doubt she avoids jail time unless she's a 1st time offender.",lincoln

"Exactly my thought. Things were going bad before Covid but when that came along people got so much of their news and social interaction from social media and so many spiraled into these negative feedback loops. The things is most of us in our face to face social interactions feel like people are supportive, kind, thoughtful. We have all had such great experiences with people helping and reaching out. But at the same time so many people have fallen into this trap where we are convinced that there is this large mass of “others” that are dangerous, and crazy, and violent and to be feared. And so much of it is the fault of the media. I have talked to people that genuinely believe that there are people in other countries who don’t care for their children the same way we do, that don’t value life, that actually want to blow themselves up if it means they can kill others. The constant media poisoning has dehumanized others and created this atmosphere of fear and paranoia. It’s ironic that we are having this interchange on social media, I realize, but I feel like if we all got off of these devices except for a few minutes a day we would realize that things really aren’t falling apart as we have been told over and over and that the neighbor with the political sign we don’t agree with is actually a nice guy who will help you when you need it.",lincoln

"Bitcoin, like the Internet, is a network defined by its protocol first and foremost. The Bitcoin network enables peer to peer transactions without a central authority - like the bank. It’s putting power in the hands of the user by providing a network that is both permissionless and censorship resistant - you need not ask to use the network.  

This is very unlike our financial networks today where your transactions are often permissioned, surveilled and censored. Provide one wrong move and the bank has the authority to lock your funds.  

This wasn’t much of a problem during cash days but now that 90% of our payments are digital with most assets stored in a central bank, our ability to be self sovereign and private has been restricted.

Bitcoin is an alternative to our current system that enables some really unique opportunities. Speculating on the value of that asset is 100% gambling. We are not here to gamble. We are here to understand the future of digital economies.

"Hi, welcome.  Good news we have a lot of lakes to choose from... bad news is the fishing isn't the most exciting.  If you are looking at a clock, from 6 to 11 there are about 11 lakes I can think of off the top of my head (many small, Branched Oak being the largest) not too far outside of Lincoln.  I've been fishing most of those lakes for over 20 years and they can be sort of hit and miss.  One year I might do really well at a lake and the next year nothing (I think this is mostly because people are taking whatever they catch out of the lakes and rarely are their game wardens around to check them).  If you like fishing for Crappie though, Branched Oak at least has a size limit on Crappie so if you find a good spot, they are usually decent sized.

Most of the lakes have plenty of access roads around them.  It is almost easiest to just use google maps satellite view and you can pick out the roads coming into them pretty easily.  Wagon Train (straight south) had a rehabilitation project done and was mostly drained last year.  I don't think it is even close to being back to full yet, so best to cross that one off the list for 2024 unless we get a ton of rain and quick.",lincoln

"It has been proposed before but we were never stupid enough to actually advance a bill with it in the legislature. 


For games like Powerball, the state gets half the gross revenue. But there are a lot of expenses that they have to pay out of that money, and 100% of what's left over goes to good causes. The state is required to send a minimum of 22% to the good cause groups too, which limits things.


A tax on lottery doesn't make sense for lots of reasons but the biggest is because it's a tax in the gross sales, not the next benefit to the state. The gross is around $220 million, net is far less. If the legislature wants a piece of the money pie, they should add the unicameral's general fund to the list of beneficiaries. 


If this passes and the 1% sales tax increase goes through making tax rate 6.5% that means the legislature will be taking around $13million per year from the beneficiaries. That equals an entire fiscal quarter's worth of transfers to good causes in any given year.



It may not even be possible to do it either because of the mandated 22% return. It's a giant mess and the senators don't seem to realize the impact of what they're proposing. ",lincoln

It is predicted there will be 3 fed rate cuts which indirectly move mortgage rates down.  Once those cuts actually happen I will be writing multiple offers a week competing with 20 other offers.  

If you are a serious buyer now is the time to buy before every house has multiple offers again and pushes 20k over list.  We are already starting to see it on some houses.

"Spoonraker! How have you been!? I have a different user name now because my last one was the same as my domain and used on a lot of official accounts so it was easy to dox me. We used to work together if the first name isn't enough of a hint.

Anyway, one can't argue intent to steal, but utilizing information or resources I have to make a transaction occur and have machine voluntarily give me gas could be disputed. Like, if I give a cashier $5 and he gives me two 10's instead of 1's as change and I saw it but didn't say anything, would that be an arrestable offense since he gave it to me even though I knew?

I am reminded of Phil Ivey, who cheated at a casino using a technique called ""edge sorting"", which looks at subtle differences of the backs of certain playing cards to know what the next face down card is. There was clear intent because he demanded to use that type of deck and had the sway to make it happen. The casino tried to sue him but since they allowed the deck to be used they had nothing.

I would think they would settle for a lesser charge of some sort because she was given the gas through the exploit, she didn't exactly steal it off the shelves (although not too far off) or hold someone by gunpoint.",lincoln

"KABREDLOS IS THE FUCKING WORST

They tried to screw us over when we moved out of our apartment. I stupidly let them do a walk through before we were done moving out and they claimed we had all of these damages to the apartment. As you might expect, we hadn’t cleaned up properly yet, so it was all based on a lie. They tried to make us pay 1000 DOLLARS in supposed damages to the unit. The only actual damage was a stain on the carpet in one of the bedrooms. 

I called the temporary apartment manager (who was filling in for the usual manager who was on maternity leave) and chewed him the fuck out and he hung up on me. We refused to pay the bill and we haven’t heard from them since that happened like 6 years ago. I don’t know if they forgot about us or they knew their charges were bullshit and dropped it. I’m just glad it wasn’t sent to collections. 

My theory is that they try to take advantage of poor people and immigrants, and trump up as many charges as possible because they may not know better. They are truly scum and overcharge for everything.",lincoln

2. As she was not the original rewards account holder, she would never have been presented with its TOS
3. There is no TOS listed at the gas station
4. Rewards cards aren't valid forms of ID, and so her using the card does not constitute ID theft
5. Gas stations are self-service, and so, just as in a self-checkout line, the user is compelled to accept what the POS says. If the POS at the pump said she owed nothing, then she would have no reason to believe otherwise (see point #1)
6. Because points 1 & 5 above, anyone else she lent the card to would have been subject to the same conclusions. Also, she had reasonable basis to believe the gas was hers to sell",lincoln

We used the ""unused"" spaces nearly every day for kids playtime, picnics, dog training, visiting with friends, etc. There were clubs of people meeting weekly for a free outdoor space to pursue their varied hobbies. The ""unused"" space is so helpful not just for people, but for ecological reasons (ex.- drainage issues cause by large swaths of concrete).

Individual may only drive unsupervised between 12 midnight and 6 a.m. if they are driving to or from home to work or a school activity.

"It all comes down to ""what is your time worth?"" You can learn a bit more about cars and do the work yourself, you can continue to pay for maintenance and upkeep, or you could trade them off.

I learned about cars with my first couple of cars - mechanical, carbureted, no OBD plugs to tell you what's wrong. If I hadn't done that, I probably wouldn't be doing it today. But modern cars can easily go hundreds of thousands of miles and if you're frugal and want to save money, it might be worth your while to learn a bit more and do some of the work yourself. These days, with and OBD reader from Amazon and a Haynes/Chilton manual, it's really pretty straightforward. But it's back to that original point - what is your time worth?

Most Midwest Main lines including this line used to be triple or quad tracked but are now reduced down to 2 tracks to save on costs..    The costs for the 3rd track , stations and rolling stock would probably be around 450-500 million if you look at other proposed midwestern corridor projects.   Ridership would depend on how often you ran the service.   3 seems to be average for a starter service, with a goal of 7-12 roundtrips for most full builds.

"We've been in the market for a new vehicle for a while, and were finally in a place to pull the trigger.  Would rather have waited a couple months, but the old car was giving indications it wanted to go to the farm. . .  so last month we went shopping.

First, went to Baxter.  I wanted a Toyota for several reasons, and aside from both of us having bad history with Baxter, they are the Toyota dealer in town.  We were shopping specifically for a used SUV less than 5 years old; both to get as much as we could for our money, but also because we couldn't spend as much as we'd need to for the new model.  Baxter was. . . different this time.  They weren't rude, didn't use questionable tactics, didn't really give us the ""Ick"" vibe at all.  They just lined up the models we wanted to test drive and then talked about financing.  This is where most everybody agrees in this thread, they didn't negotiate and couldn't offer sub-prime financing in any way.  They offered a good rate if the vehicle was certified used by Toyota, but even that rate was more than we could get through our credit union.  (and due to a weird recall that can't be fixed yet, most newer Toyotas can't be certified because they have an open recall)  They basically told us we could shop anywhere else, because they couldn't meet or beat what we were already approved for.   

We went home, had dinner, thought about what we ""needed"" vs what we ""wanted"" and then saw a RAV4 online with all the bells & whistles (and a hybrid!) in our price range.  It was at the Honda dealer across the street, on their used lot off south 27th street.  We test drove it that night, and had all the paperwork run to pick it up the next day.  They were fucking fantastic, even stayed late to make sure we had time with vehicle and could ask any questions.  They even did additional detailing before we picked it up because we mentioned grease on the window and some other things.  They gave me more than fair trade-in for a car that could only go to auction.  And while they accepted our financing from our credit union, overnight they were able to approve financing through their own lender for half a percent less!  

It is very much a seller's market right now.  But, you can find places that will still work with you as much as possible.  Honda of Lincoln went the extra mile to give good trade-in value, and better financing, even if they couldn't actually lower the price of the car.",lincoln

There are a lot of people who won’t sell because they have 3% interest mortgages, so there’s limited supply. There are a lot of people who don’t want to buy at current rates, so demand is also lower.

If rates drop some, you’ll have more people willing to sell and more supply, but also more pent up demand finally jumping in to buy, which may prevent prices from falling.

"I went to NWU. Graduated in 2007. Yeah it’s a “Christian” college, but not in practice. I did have to take one (?) Bible class, but it was actually more deconstructing the Bible/comparing and contrasting the gospels more than anything. No praying or faith building exercise or whatever. I also took a world religion class, which I believe was also required. They skipped Christianity in that class and we studied things like Jainism, Hinduism, and then some really obscure ancient religions. I always felt like the NWU was very accepting, even in the early 2000s when I went there. However it IS a private/expensive school, so when I was there it was mostly white middle/upper middle class kids bc mom and dad could afford it. So there’s that. I moved to a nearby town outside of Lincoln about 8 years ago and the dynamic of Lincoln has changed DRASTICALLY!!!

"Woods does a lot of good for the community. They give a lot of opportunity to low income kids through scholarships and sponsorships. They provide free lessons for kids that qualify. I am a low income person and my kids benefited from the programs when my family was going through a very rough patch. It helped the morale of my kids greatly. Here is the full disclosure from Woods that clarifies everything: 

As you may know, Friends of Woods Tennis (FOWT) has put forth a proposal to expand the current tennis center with the addition of 4 new indoor courts and 3 additional outdoor courts, along with much-needed classroom, training, and administrative space. Our proposal, including a preliminary/conceptual design (see attached (https://mcusercontent.com/3203d532b2136fc1bc7e3a3e4/files/9187fbc1-809e-b15b-867c-63ac9cfc0c74/Plans.05.pdf) ) has been sent to the Lincoln Parks & Recreation Board for their consideration and approval.

In the interest of transparency, there are certain groups within the surrounding neighborhoods that are opposed to the expansion, citing concern for losing “green space” within Woods Park & Sports Complex. While we respect their opinions, there have been several falsehoods and misrepresentations of our proposal as part of their opposition.

We want to provide you with the facts, along with several avenues you can take to help support our mission of “Taking the Game to The Community.”

Why Expand?

Put simply, we have significant more demand for courts than we have availability at Woods Tennis Center.
* Woods Tennis Center supports more than 12,000 area tennis players each year, from age 3-93, from beginners to national champions.
* Our tennis programming includes youth, adults, wheelchair, adaptive, high school & collegiate tournaments, United State Tennis Association (USTA) leagues and tournaments, as well as Missouri Valley tournaments. Woods Tennis Center is widely recognized as the “crown jewel” of tennis in Nebraska.
* We have over 2,000 junior players in the program. Our current session of youth programming has more than 520 participants—with a waitlist of another 120 junior players who cannot play due to capacity.
* There is currently a waitlist of over 200+ players wanting individual lessons/instruction. The wait is over a year to receive those lessons.
* Each month there are 150-200 court requests that cannot be fulfilled.
* In 2023, we reached indoor capacity 322 of 365 days. Outdoor capacity reached 126 days. Both numbers FAR EXCEED national industry averages.
* We are missing critical opportunities for our local players to participate in more regional and national tournaments without the need or expense of travel.


To summarize, we have an opportunity to bring all the benefits that Woods Tennis Center provides to more of our community and surrounding area…allowing us to further deliver on our mission of “Taking the Game to The Community.”


Why Not Somewhere Else?

Our opposition suggests building another tennis facility in a different part of the city. Why not do that?
* Woods Tennis Center is in Woods Park & Sports Complex, which is officially designated as a “community park (https://mcusercontent.com/3203d532b2136fc1bc7e3a3e4/images/b46bd84a-a2ab-d5f2-18f0-c88b5f088b18.jpg) ” rather than just a “neighborhood park.” This is an important distinction.
* Woods Tennis Center is centrally located within Lincoln, affording easy access for all.
* Woods Tennis Center serves a highly diverse audience, including many players who could simply not afford to travel and play elsewhere. We have provided more than $225,000 in scholarships since 2009, as well as more than 4,000 free racquets to first time players and those who could not afford their own.
* There has been a significant investment in the current location. Adding a second location would double the cost of land acquisition, infrastructure, staffing, insurance, utilities, etc. As a self-sustaining non-profit, building and maintaining a second location is not economically feasible.
* Our current proposal adds the needed indoor and outdoor courts while taking less than 1.5 acres of the current 49 acres of Woods Park. Our proposed expansion would re-orient courts and parking to the South (see attached (https://mcusercontent.com/3203d532b2136fc1bc7e3a3e4/files/3e025ae8-8e6e-32f2-faba-97e5c48ee1d4/Plans.04.pdf) ) while preserving the larger open spaces of the park to the North. Our expansion will not impact any of the many activities currently enjoyed at Woods Park. If approved, we will have a robust plan for water management, landscaping, replacement of trees and other park improvements.


Some Other Important Facts
* Woods Tennis Center is open to all. We are NOT a private club. We do NOT require memberships. Like the Lincoln Children’s Zoo or The Children’s Museum, our patrons use our facilities for a set fee (or through scholarships). These fees help us to remain self sustainable.
* Mayo Clinic research shows that people who play tennis live an average of 10 years longer than those who don’t. Other health data indicates strong positive effects on character development, decreased risky behaviors, better academic outcomes, and increased volunteer rates within the community. The more people we can accommodate, the better for everyone!
* The Woods Park Master Plan already allowed/approved the construction of 4 new indoor courts as part of Phase II. This was approved by the Lincoln City Council in 2016. We are wanting to complete that phase along with the addition of 3 outdoor courts, to meet current demand. (Note: All our outdoor courts are constructed of asphalt and have outlived their useful life. Current industry standards call for outdoor courts to be “post-tension.” Our expansion plan will bring all courts up to accepted standards.)
* If approved, the expansion of Woods Tennis Center will be funded by private donors and will not adversely affect the taxes of Lincoln-area residents. As a self-sustaining non-profit, we actually contribute dollars to the Lincoln Parks and Recreation budget.",lincoln

But the conclusion I’m developing is that each major city/area has its own breed of “bad”.

"They are hardest to move.  We foster, and most of our dogs come from southern Missouri and southern Kansas.  The non-pits move out, get fostered, get adopted, and they end up chock full of pits.

I was very cautious of the breed.  We took in a pair last summer.  Sweet dogs.  One was adopted, still have the other.  Have had several other dogs come and go while he's been here.  He would absolutely be someone's 'soul' dog.  He just loves his human, it's all that matters to him.  He is very submissive to all other dogs, goes into army crawl mode at the first sign of adversity.  But loves to share a chair with his human, or cuddle for a nap.

"I'm going to make a couple of guesses here and there's no judgment here:

1. You don't know much about cars;
2. You pay others for service.
3. Your cars have a few miles on them.

I don't think you're getting scammed or defrauded. I think you're getting the usual, generic treatment folks get at places like this.

Every car should have the oil changed every 3k-10k miles, depending on the car. You should have the serpentine belt replaced every 60-100k miles, the timing belt every 80k-120k, the transmission flushed every 80k, etc.... Again, all of these numbers depend on the vehicle - some say that the transmission is ""maintenance free"" (which is horseshit) and never needs a flush and fill.

What's happening is that you're going in and saying ""hey, I need an oil change and my car has 120k miles on it."" They put that into the computer and it explodes with warnings that you need all of the above services I mentioned and more because of the mileage you gave them. They aren't even looking to see if you just replaced any of these pieces, they just go with what the computer says. And for folks who don't do their own maintenance or know that much about cars, this isn't necessarily a bad practice. Failure to do this routine maintenance can result in catastrophic failure of the vehicle.

Personally, I do all of my own work on my cars but last year I got a certified pre-owned car that came with some oil changes from the dealer. I took the car into the dealer for the oil change and they came back and said ""oh man, you need to check this and replace that and...."" on and on and on. I told them that I'd better not need that since I had just gotten the car CPO six months earlier and I expected that all of those things had been addressed. Sure enough, they're just reading the script the computer gave them since their service computer and sales computer wasn't linked.

On the plus side, I'll bet that what the did was all preventative work. It's cheaper (even with inflated shop prices) to replace a timing belt than to let it snap and blow the motor. 

I don't have a recommendation for a shop for you but a smaller, independent shop will be much better in that they generally won't alienate you with the generic ""sky is falling"" stuff. They'll look at what's needed and say ""well, your serpentine belt should be replaced at 100k but yours looks great; don't worry about it for another 50k."" But if I were you, I would read your owners manual. In there somewhere should be a table or chart or list of times to do certain maintenance. If you go in and a shop says you should replace something, check the maintenance chart. If it's way off time/mileagewise, you'll have an idea to ask some questions.",lincoln

For years that agency downplayed the severity of that illness and tacitly approved the untimely deaths of queer people. Fauci's ""the vulnerable will fall by the wayside"" is blatant eugenics . To be clear, the science is plain. Covid is a disaster that strips your immune system of CD8 cells and causes lymphocytopenia. Meaning you will be more vulnerable to diseases that are modulated by interferon and to secondary infection after a bout of Covid. The mechanisms are not the same as AIDS, but the outcomes are eerily similar. 

If for no other reason, I feel that everyone should be masking around children (because children can't consent to infection or independently obtain vaccination) and in medical settings and other essential places, like grocery stores.

A pack of German Shepherds recently attacked a jogger here in Lincoln. But I still haven't written that breed off because of some others I have encountered. Pitbulls are no different. Cocker Spaniels actually have one of the worst temperaments and were the most likely dog to bite, and yet people get those dogs all the time. The only difference is if you're attacked by a pitbull that has been bred with bulldogs and mastiffs for desired muscle mass, those dogs are just gonna mess you up a lot worse than a cocker spaniel. But these pitbull mixes at the humane society are no different than any other mutt and aren't any more dangerous. If they did indeed bite as often as many of you say, there would be a dog bite epidemic because of the sheer number of these dogs that are over bred and are one of the most common dogs owned in this country. DNA test your dogs and see how many of them have Pitbull DNA. Just some look more pitbull than others. It's been proven that DNA tests on dogs find pitbull DNA more than twice as often as the #2 dog. Surveys with vets and animal control have shown that in at least 21 states, pitbulls are the most commonly owned breed of dog. They're everywhere. And 99.9% ain't biting or bothering anyone. Again, there are 18 MILLION pitties in this country. Even if only 5% of them were biting and making people, that would be over a million. And that just isn't happening.",lincoln

"Hey there. If you want some advice on picking up firearms for a deal and to solid places PM me. 

You don't have to eat yourself up for wanting to own a firearm.

What I will post that people can read is that AR-15's aren't a very practical self defense weapon.

This all depends on your philosophy of use though. This is scenario based. If you are looking for home protection an AR can be clumsy, hard to operate in the dark, and will cause temporary deafness when shot even outside without your ears on.

The tendency to miss in altercations leaves your neighbors or even family vulnerable to collateral damage as well due to such high velocities.

If you insist on using a rifle I would recommend a shot gun. It doesn't eliminate the risk of projectiles entering another room, but the drywall decreases projectile velocities immensely.

Perhaps a pistol with a manageable caliber would be better. Red dot, and tactical light provided it has a rail below the puzzle and optics ready.

"Dude I'm not sure how to continue here. You've identified the issue, but then continue to talk around it. 

This is a thread about somebody who is trying to find store bought cannabis in Nebraska. Your Coloradoan perspective is literally not helpful to anyone in Nebraska. You said it yourself - your market is regulated, ours is not.

Here's a more accurate analogy: you tell me that you sell zebras in Colorado, and that the painted horses being sold in Nebraska are exactly the same as your zebras. 

>what you're buying isn't what it was sold as

Which is exactly why I'm skeptical. I didn't buy THCA in Colorado, it was in Nebraska. All of the head shop reps in town will tell a customer *everything you have said* as if it accurately reflects the products that *they* are selling. Then the customer goes home, lights up, and finds out that the guy in the Hy-Vee parking lot could have sold you stronger stuff. It makes you question everything the head shop bro was pitching to you. 

My main issue is that a frequent argument that gets made is that ""it's basically the exact same as what you can get in [legal state]"". I have been to CO and can absolutely say that I do not agree that, in terms of POWER, NOT CHEMICAL MAKEUP, the THCA in NEBRASKA is anywhere close to the same as that in CO. 

You clearly would have no idea about that since you live in Colorado and not Nebraska. Your arguments for THCA are not helpful for Nebraskans who can only shop in this state. I have no comment about THCA in Colorado because I've never tried it. That is also not relevant to this thread. Because it is for Nebraska THCA. 

And in case you need it explicitly stated: yes, I understand that THCA + heat = THC.

Does that clarify the issue for you at all?",lincoln

I will say that I've never tried HempBoss, so if that truly is all the difference, then so be it. But after trying flower from three different stores in town, I am skeptical.

Never heard of a catholic priest wanting to meet someone before giving Holy Communion. I don’t think you even have to be catholic to receive communion ( I believe orthodox and a few other denominations are allowed). You can attend  Mass and receive Communion anywhere.

It is very hard ( I dare say almost impossible ) to get permission to register at a different parish other than your local one.,lincoln

When I got my new one-bedroom place six months ago, it's through my former rental company. The property manager said they'd push it through since my rent history with them is/was good.

I run a commercial, legal grow in Denver. [Here is a link](https://imgur.com/gallery/WJu7Zvr) to a CoA (certificate of analysis) for one of my batches from our legal testing laboratory. As you might have noticed, ""actual"" THC value is negligible. ***THCa*** value is much, much higher. This is because the THCa *is* THC before it's been decarboxylated (read: applicable for human use). When you apply ~225°F to THCa, the chemical structure changes (to keep this nice and simple), boom it's now THC, which your body can metabolize. 

The shops selling ""THCa"" product in states across the country are selling straight up weed. It's a semantic loophole that's being exploited right now, but that other shoe will drop any day now. 

Any experience you've had that's been lackluster is because it's probably just shitty weed, but it's still your well known friend cannabis at the end of the day.

You would have to follow the procedures in the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act and file a claim with the city first. And I have no idea what the claim would be, but the procedure comes first.",lincoln
I live near 27th and O and I swear I heard gunfire around that same time.,lincoln
"If aTm wants someone, they get it. Nobody can match the oil money they have",lincoln
That's awful in my opinion. Sucks for an area which is already a food desert. ,lincoln

Have lived at Capitol beach for quite a while. The only real travel issue is getting to the east side of town. It’s super quiet and with close proximity to downtown. Highway 77/I80/Highway 2 belt way gets you pretty much anywhere quickly.,lincoln

"I really like Nebraska Gun. He’s super knowledgeable and friendly and he definitely gives off an old conservative vibe but I’ve never had him really comment on politics or randomly toss crazy out. 

He mostly does used guns but you can buy something online and have it sent there for the actual transfer. That’s what I always do.",lincoln

"I don’t have a lot of experience, but we moved from Hartley to Regent Heights (75th and Adams area) because we were looking for a safer neighborhood to raise our family. We absolutely love it. We live a few blocks from Kahoa elementary, which was a huge draw to this neighborhood.",lincoln
Shokunin in the Haymarket or Jinya in Omaha,lincoln
"That is what we were saying. We finally found an overpriced one that was sitting awhile and tossed out a low number, they countered, and made a great deal for us. We looked for 6 weeks",lincoln
Definitely not. I was an anthropology and sociology major and I only ever had 1 class with religion which was anthropology of religion a class I chose to take lol. Unless a class was specifically teaching about religion or was part of the current subject it was really never brought up.,lincoln

"Peak migration is usually mid-March but this year I think it’s now because it’s been so warm recently. The Crane Trust visitor center is worth a stop and the staff can tell you where to go. Rowe Sanctuary is also great. We’ve done the blind tours twice and I absolutely recommend doing it but you usually have to book them when they go on sale in January.  It really is a spectacular sight to see and hear as they’re coming in for the night or leaving the river at dawn.

We’re planning on going next weekend and are going to start near Doniphan and work our way west towards Rowe Sanctuary and then just take the interstate back from Gibbon. Even just from the interstate you should see a ton along that stretch",lincoln
What area? Allo should be available in all of Lincoln. Unless you live around air park.,lincoln
My vehicle was stolen for 3 weeks. I wasn't able to pick it up in the 30minute window the officer allowed me upon retrieving my vehicle before being towed by the same company. I had to pay $50 to get my own stolen vehicle out of the tow yard. No follow up from police about it being stolen. It's been 2 years since this incident.,lincoln
"The deleted commenter did not say that lmao you're misremembering and combining my comments with his. He made a comment saying he thinks it'd be cool for a mens march since courts screw over single fathers in divorces, just suggesting a cool idea before someone else got all heated in his replies for no reason, which is why he deleted it. 

I said *thinks back to every time where men have tried to organize something for themselves and it gets shut down by feminists*, not that ""every single time we do it gets shut down"" lmfao. And I didn't remove that comment, a pussy moderator did. Pay attention. Do you literally not know how to read? At all? It's right there, genius.

You never said ""that's clearly not true"" you said you cant think of a single time where it's happened, which is why I suggested you research some of those times where it has. Because just because you cant think of times where something has happened doesn't mean it never has, so you should do some research. Very straight forward. 

Why the fuck would I suggest you ""research less""? What does that even mean? Is it your first day on planet earth? If someone's telling you to research, that means there is stuff out there for you to go out and learn about. Use your brain. 

I literally said ""you need to do MORE research"" and you somehow walked away from that asking me how you're supposed to ""rEsEaRcH LeSs"" 💀

So again, what the fuck are YOU saying?

It might be time for you to try PAYING ATTENTION to the comments you're replying to instead of skimming through, inevitably missing the point, and jumping to arguing before you even understand what the person you're replying to said in the first place. Might save your little head a lot of confusion you cause for yourself. Just a thought.

Downvoting me will not make me wrong",lincoln
