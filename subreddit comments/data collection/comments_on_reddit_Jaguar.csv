"I'm so sorry to hear this OP. Dealing with it is a headache but breathe and take one day at a time. If you have the plate of the car that the tool fell from, submit it to your insurance and focus on getting it repaired. A windshield is easy to replace and looks like you have the glass roof which good or bad still had to be replaced for an entire new piece and not be repaired so at the end you'll get these new and it will look like it never happened.",Jaguar

"I‚Äôd say go for it. Except for the fuel consumption, the V6 is better in every single way and instead of a boring diesel, you‚Äôre gonna end up with a proper Jaguar engine that allows for a proper Jag experience. Also, all 2.5 a 3.0 V6s have AWD with most of the power going to the rear wheels.",Jaguar
"Worth noting that the UK car market has really poor residuals (or at least compared to European market). Not sure how it stacks up against US though, although I'd be surprised if the residuals were much worse!",Jaguar
Thank you when did you do yours?,Jaguar
"The US is a dead market for Jag. It was when I worked there and it is even more so no. JLR don't give two shits about a market they sell nothing in. 

If you think you know more than the leadership of JLR with their decades of experience, I suggest you apply for a job with them. Get ready for a serious amount of workplace politics.

"Exactly this. Battery, Alternator, and Intake covered. I‚Äôve been detailing at a JLR dealership for 3 years now. I will add we‚Äôve never had a problem with a gentle mist breaking seals or wire connectors provided they‚Äôre in good shape. if you need to wet it down, DO NOT use a power washer at a close distance on a high setting(obviously), and don‚Äôt drench the engine bay. We use an all purpose cleaner that‚Äôs none corrosive. Simple green also works!",Jaguar
thanks,Jaguar
"Apart from documentation/receipts of work done, there are two ways - only one of which is guaranteed. Ask the previous owner if they have had it done and then decide if you trust them, or have a mechanic open the valve cover with a reference image of the upper tensioner handy. 

If you're uncertain and still doubt after this, budget for the tensioner replacement job.",Jaguar
Thank Christ for the mute button. Pretty car.,Jaguar
Superb,Jaguar

"My experience, Jag engines are solid and serve you well, Gearbox holds up, but everything else from the AC and the radio, to the wiper fluid hoses, to wires and electrics, all tear and break down and leave you in shit",Jaguar
This car is low as is. You probably could lower it but it will make it less comfortable.,Jaguar
"Look for a few key things. 

If it‚Äôs supercharged, start the car and run it on a test drive, park it and turn it off. Start the car after a minute and listen for chain slap on the timing chain/tensioners. It‚Äôs a time bomb, but more prevalent in the supercharged. 

Suspension is probably shot. I replaced mine last year. There may be clunks from the sway bar bushings which should be worn down.

Water pump!!!! Check to see *when* it was replaced, not if. There‚Äôs a 0% chance it‚Äôs never had a swap. The plastic coolant pipes will be tied to this service and age. Another thing to look for.",Jaguar
Tbf Mazda and Jaguar during that period were owned by Ford.,Jaguar
I like your wheels.,Jaguar
I absolutely love my I-Pace ‚Äî bring on the electric Jaaaags!,Jaguar
"I love that my 2014 XK is pretty unique. Don‚Äôt let the scarcity of the car fool you. Are there more Fords and Chevrolets and on the road than Bentley‚Äôs or Ferrari‚Äôs? Does that mean that they are better cars? No way! The same goes for Jags. Quantity does not usually align with quality. In fact they are usually mutually exclusive!

Why there are less Jags‚Ä¶. People still worry about Jaguars pre Ford past unreliability reputation (Ford bought Jag in 1999 and spent billions fixing Jags issues). I have owned several jags both pre-Ford and post-Ford. I can attest that pre-Ford Jags were quite unreliable. However, my two most recent Jags (which are now built by Tata Motors), includes a 2005 XK (which ran great for 230,000 miles until it was t-boned) and my current 2014 XK (which now has 50,000 miles) have been quite reliable daily drivers.

This unreliability perception actually provides you with a fantastic benefit. Because of the past above-mentioned reliability issues, the resale value on Jags is not close to the true value of the cars. You should take advantage of this misconception to get in on what I, and most Jag owners, believe to be one of the finest automobiles on the road today.

In addition, you won‚Äôt EVER walk up to the wrong car in the parking lot!",Jaguar
"Hehe, your user name certainly checks out!

That being said, I do like the battery tech. I think they have individually replaceable cells vs having to replace packs.",Jaguar

"I stole the Jaguar, and I‚Äôm scared of bugs.",Jaguar
"Keep in mind that if the trip is 300- 350 one way, you'll need destination charging to keep it to one stop per leg.  My place on the coast is about 150 miles away, but the I Pace is perfect because I can destination charge while I'm there.

The Tesla Superchargers will help with accessibility, but not with speed.  As mentioned before, the I Pace simply won't take more than about 100 kWh/hour max no matter how fast the charger is.  The tradeoff is that the traction battery longevity has been good with the I Pace.  Regular 150+ kWh/hour charging sessions are not good for the battery, even on a Tesla.

Also, if your longer trips are in Summer, that will help with range.  Cold weather kills range on all EVs.  I live in Florida, so I forget  about that sometimes.",Jaguar
"I likte it alot! Sanguinello Orange its called, by Special Vehicle Operations. Too expensive thoüòÖ",Jaguar
"May depend on if the car has been in the dealer network all its life or not been seen in a long time, then they take it there and expect the dealer to work magic. Especially on something like a Discovery 1/2 which tend to be modified by now and be in ‚Äúgod knows what shape‚Äù. Some old boy who‚Äôs had his Jag 20years and been in on the book schedule is a different proposition.",Jaguar
"Yeah, nearly got front ended by a tosser doing an optimistic overtake in an f type on the A92 yesterday. Had to do an emergency stop so he could get back in front of the 3 cars he was trying to take before arriving at the bend I was exiting. Loads of them round here.",Jaguar
"Hello, fellow old XJ owner! Such gorgeous cars, even with some patina. Does it run?",Jaguar
Lower springs or some different wheels,Jaguar
"I've owned two X308 chassis cars, including my current XJR.  Actually, once sorted, they are pretty reliable.  Sorted on my first one meant replacing the fuel pump and sending unit.  A bear of a job since access to the fuel lines is obstructed by the rear differential.  I went to a shop for that one.  

All my XJR has required is repairing the hood latch cable and tracing down an electrical glitch with the third brake light. Also had to undo all of the LED bulbs the previous owner had put in. They were causing all kinds of oddities with fast flashes and constant ""check rear lights"" dash warnings.",Jaguar

"First lesson I learned with my 2017 jag. I had a service engine soon light after I bought it, was just the automatic 60,000 mile regular service indicator. I didn‚Äôt know that. Took it to the local chain auto shop, *just* so they could get some readings with their OBD reader. So they plugged it in, and then the dash lit up like a cherry tree and the car went into limp mode. We literally did not even pop the hood or take it out of the parking lot. Swear I‚Äôll never let anyone plug an OBD reader in if it‚Äôs not my own local mechanic, who knows jags.  Do with that what you will lol.",Jaguar
I own an x308 and it‚Äôs great. Only issue is major repairs since the parts are rare and if you can‚Äôt do it yourself it‚Äôs brutal to the wallet.,Jaguar
"Yes, the code can be used to reference with a list for that engine. I do not know where to source the list but you might try a search. This is essentially what an update to a scanner would do when you download vehicle specific updates.

"Mustang/Challengers have the worst handling! I hate driving them. They are also literally everywhere‚Ä¶ like the corvette.

"Thank you! Haha that is a subject i‚Äôm sort of ignoring right now, but i‚Äôm very interested in acquiring a steel brake system for it in the future. Preferably before the carbon ceramics show any signs of death, but so far they seem ridiculously tolerant to normal driving. As far as records tell, they seem to be all original and pads all measure 8-10mm. First time owning a CC brake system so only time will tell. So far the indication seems to be that they barely wear under normal-ish driving. Oh and like zero brake dust as a bonus.",Jaguar

Prices have droppped and dealerships will definitely negotiate - I had this one reduced nearly 10K from the original listing + 4 new tires - they allowed me an extended test drive and let my private mechanic have the car for nearly a full day before I agreed to make a purchase - allot of variables to work with - downside will be finacing cars of this age not many banks willing so expect to be putting allot $ down or ending up with a high interest rate - use cargurus if in the US doing searches so you can fine tune the car with the specs you want.

They could have dumbed down the brand to bring in lower tiers of customers, where even with the reliability problems they outprice other available speed, or they go full luxury. They cant do #2 because Aston and RR exist there. Audi and Merc cant sell EVs. Jaaaag will go under. They should have broken into the cheap sports car market. Think Nissan Z car or even GTR.

Both also said the coolant pipes would need to be replaced, so I went in with my eyes open on that. Some of the warranty work was just replacing parts because they would pay for it. Carvana also paid to have the car professionally detailed at a cost of $600 after I complained that it wasn't very clean when I picked it up. 

I'm not mad about it and the car is fun as shit. Sometimes it just reminds me that I paid $34,000 for a car that stickered at $86,000 and the repair costs will reflect that.",Jaguar

"I know it‚Äôs particularly concerning seeing a gear box fault message pop up but it does seem quite a large coincidence you found a problem associated to that battery, leaving it to run flat and that GB fault pop up.

As another mentioned, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a completely flat battery is a culprit to a number of errors and with a bit of luck all you require for that is to have a diagnostic machine clear your error codes. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact you‚Äôre stuck in park, most codes clear when driving a couple of minutes.

As for your battery, it sounds like you‚Äôve found a specific fault there. It‚Äôs a little bizarre you‚Äôve found a lose connection but either way, I‚Äôd recommend getting your battery load tested and based on that result, replace your battery if necessary. If your battery isn‚Äôt ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù an alternator test would be my next check, to help determine why your battery is flat.

(It could be as simple as you‚Äôve unknowingly run the battery completely flat due to that loose terminal you found)

I don't think you can damage the shock by compressing it - after all that's what they are there for. But I'd ask the forum. The key thing probably won't work anyway as it only goes soft when you exceed 5 kph I think. Default as you have discovered is hard.

On a Range Rover I had a similar problem without any CATS stuff and I put a jack under the bottom the of the shock absorber and compressed it that way. I think I was able to slide it off the jack into place but I can't recall. It was fiddly and not without risk but I was young and risky.

"Thanks very much for your detailed reply and long list of things to check out! When I reinstalled the SC I did use ‚Äúguide pins‚Äù which were basically bolts of the correct size that screwed into the intake manifold that I cut the head off each and placed the new gaskets through them followed by the SC. I did not have a working torque wrench at the time so snugged up the six bolts once the SC was aligned tight by hand. 

I guess it may be worth removing the air charge cooler and checking the torque on these bolts now that I bought a new torque wrench. 

As for the tune, that was the first thing I thought of too. I emailed Chris who is the technical director at Velocity AP as it is their pulley I installed with their accompanying tune. His response‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthe reason for the fuel ratio imbalance codes is most likely related to an intake air or exhaust leak, potentially a clogged exhaust, or restricted injectors‚Äù and ‚Äúthe codes are stored while cruising and not at WOT. If the file was at fault, you would be seeing freeze frame from the codes above 6000rpm.  If you were to view a freeze frame of your AFR imbalance codes, odds are they are all under 4000rpm and most likely in the 2K range or at idle speeds‚Äù.

"Pretty standard repairs. I‚Äôve had my car 6 years, I‚Äôve had two stuck injectors, did spark plugs myself, did the Y pipes before they cracked, air filters are a DIY project, I‚Äôve replaced 3 O2 sensors I think. Great car.",Jaguar

"The basic Meridian (13 speaker) system in my XJ is actually very good, however, I'd like to take it up a notch and apparently the Reference series (the red speakers) from an Autobiography model is great and it would be so much cheaper to go with a used set rather than going with a high-end new set of speakers. The question is - is it a straight swap and does it need new wiring as I've seen somewhere that the wires for the speakers, which are absent on lower trim cars, are already pre-installed.",Jaguar

"Lovely - it's almost asking for an oily-rag restoration, to capture the patina!

The Series 1 and 2 XJ6s are proper classic Jaguars steeped in the history of Air William and Browns Lane. I just love them.

The big chunk of rubber on the front bumper looks really ugly if you're used to Euro-spec cars, but the chrome trim stripe down the side is very unusual.

The wheels look like after-market add-ons - not sure if I like them or not!

Good luck with it - it's a beauty.",Jaguar
"The transmission is the weak link. On the supercharged versions Daimler super V8 / XJR have the Mercedes AMG trans which is bombproof compared to the ZF in the NA model.

"I'm passively looking at them now, too.  Would love to find a matching Sportbrake S that has my Italian Racing Red paint and black wheels.  I have a 2017 F Type with the 3.0l engine and the Sportbrake 3.0 is subject to the same potential coolant Y-pipe failure that the F-Types face, so you'll want to check to see if that has been replaced as it was (irritatingly) not a warranty recall, but rather was just a TSB.

If it hasn't been replaced, it becomes one of those ""while you're in there"" deals because, to replace the Y-pipe, you have to remove the supercharger.  Perfect time to proactively replace the water pump, belt, and any hoses that could use a refresh.",Jaguar
"

i'm saying the e-type is for an older generation because it was made from the 60-70s. i dont care about cars made back then. the only car i'd ever consider getting from the 70s is a 911.",Jaguar
No I have full coverage though,Jaguar
"I had to change amps because I had to add some other equipment, change subwoofer to make it sound good. I spent about 5k to get it where I want it but I would recommend asking your local car audio specialist if you are not experienced in this and just ask them to take a peek at your speakers and ask if there is a simple upgrade option that won't require major rewiring and could work with the stock setup. 

General advice is upgrade the speakers you have first, see how it sounds, and try to go from there! Everyone has different ears and standards for what sounds good, or good enough.",Jaguar
Common issues are brakes and tyres due to the weight allegedly. Got a 10 plate XF and so far it‚Äôs been perfect.,Jaguar

"While I agree that the MG brand is better used on different vehicles, I simply don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reasonable to call them ‚ÄúChinese junk‚Äù. They are capable and affordable cars.

"I have a 2014 convertible XK. A bit different car but same reasoning might apply. I chose the convertible even though they traditionally cost more than the coupe for a couple of reasons.
(1) I drive with the top down much more than I take a trip
(2) Unlike a coupe, a convertible provides me with two options. I can  drive closed (coup) or open (convertible)
(3) There‚Äôs nothing quite like driving with the wind in your hair on a beautiful sunny day.
I can‚Äôt load up my car with big pieces of luggage but I usually am able to plan smartly and pack accordingly.

I own this exact car and there is nooooo waaaaaay there isnt a HUGE issue for that price,Jaguar

It‚Äôs 2 years or 20k for the first service,Jaguar
"depends on hard, theyre not too bad the 4.2 super is a damn strong engine and this ones been abused horribly. for where i live parts are rare, main dealer didn't even have the air filter in, and for expenses purely depends on where you live, fuel and oil is cheap but parts are expensive in my country though may be opposite for you.

as for whats wrong with it.
here its having its L.P side AC hose replaced as it split. the other things include oil leaks from front and rear main seals, a very intese and horrible rattle when i start it, park sensors not working, rear left window being the only working one, suspension knocks, cd changers, Bluetooth phone module(though not too sure on that) and interior things.

but i bought it in 2020 as purely a fun thing and its a miracle its ran this long.

"Everybody can have bad experiences with X or Y car, that's why there are warranties and lemon laws. But that doesn't mean the Fiat 500 isn't a massively successful car that has clearly struck a chord with the public.

"XJS is an earlier coupe, not a sedan. Do you mean an XJ6?

If so, then I have bad news for you. 90s cars are now at the bottom of their depreciation curve. Chances are that the car will be next to worthless AND hard to move. A quick check on Cars&Bids shows some that went around $5k, but they were nearly pristine and it was 3 years ago. Edmunds shows about the same numbers. It‚Äôs also a bit of a double whammy, because those XJs aren‚Äôt that cheap to run (though not ruinous either).

The smart thing here would probably be to go full bangernomics on the XJ, keep the power train pristine and forget about everything else. With a little bit of luck, it will carry you to a place where you can afford a truck.",Jaguar
You meant F-Type?,Jaguar
Why shouldn't they? And why not? Because you're nostalgic about engines? I am too man but that's a selfish reason to stop progress. There's no reason to use sails just because the old ship captain prefers the nostalgia of using the sails versus a steam engine.,Jaguar

If jag thinks they're going to sell anything at those numbers they're crazy.  They won't have dealers who is going to want the headaches.  Plus they'll kill any value the older models have if you can't get parts or mechanics.,Jaguar
"All depends on what the tech at the dealer is willing to work on. As these cars get older parts are harder to come by, and being a rather low volume brand there isn‚Äôt a lot of jag specific knowledge out there especially with techs new to the industry. 

Another thing about these euro brands(besides the German makes) is that factory support is limited. Even on Italian cars(Maserati, Fiat, Alfa USDM) they just don‚Äôt have easily accessible service data available to the techs. In the eyes of the dealer it simply isn‚Äôt economical/practical to take on a job.",Jaguar

"I made the mistake of putting lower rated tires on my V8 XF and it was not the same driving experience. Traction control kicked in a LOT more, I had to be a bit more careful.  My 2nd-hand F Type has non-factory W rated but when I eventually replace them I'll go with Z-rated. Tires should match the capability of the engine if you want to squeeze out all of its potential.

Just my opinion.",Jaguar
"I am not super creative, just a classic critic. The only think I‚Äôd say that is maybe helpful is that you have very pretty, flowing, and elegant camera shots that just don‚Äôt mix well will abrasive and jarring music in general.",Jaguar
"Yeah, it's not just packaging, there are some strange design decisions in there too. For example, the Front Right CV Axle goes through the transfer case, and if you remove it further than \~7 inches, it ruins all the internal seals in the transfer case. Or the AC lines are routed in front of the bolts, so you need to remove the AC lines to remove the compressor, and you have to remove the compressor to replace the oil pressure sensor (common problem), or alternator (IIRC).",Jaguar
"How do you mean? The company is owned by Tata, but manufactured in Birmingham at the Castle Bromwich plant. The engines are assembled in Wolverhampton. The car was largely designed by a British bloke named Ian Callum. I would say it‚Äôs about as British as a car can possibly be these days.",Jaguar
"That's cool... It doesn't have the stock radio... it's an aftermarket Pioneer AM/FM/Cassette unit from the late 80's... I knew there wasn't room for a double din, but was hoping someone would know of a kit to add a single din unit without destroying the dash... I'm not opposed to trimming it up if it can look nice, but I can see that could be difficult. I wouldn't be opposed to a Bluetooth transmitter, hadn't even thought of that. I have seen several pictures online of interiors where people installed a single DIN unit and either took a newer dash unit and swapped it in or there was an aftermarket kit they used...

The stock alloys will probably get refurbished in time, I don't plan on trashing them, but I would really like to get some larger wheels and some more ""sporty"" tires installed... I know that takes away from the nostalgia aspect of it but I think it would look good. Was just curious if they would fit.

Thanks for the advice!",Jaguar
"Where are you based? Here in the UK ¬£10k will net you a very decent one quite easily. Some go for crazy prices, or at least they try to. Whether they actually sell or not is another thing. If you find one with plenty of history and especially if common things have been recently done like brake lines, fuel straps etc I wouldn't be afraid of relatively high mileage. Imo it's not worth paying way over the odds for a low mileage one. I was gonna say green ones are somewhat rare, but at the minute there are several LWB green ones for sale in the UK and all but one are under 10 grand.",Jaguar

"For ultimate handling in an F-Type, the lighter-nosed P300 4-pot turbo is the champ, objectively. Though widely dissed (usually by those who've never driven one), its 3360 lb weight (3405 for the convertible) lets it navigate twisty roads like a real sports car. And 295 lb-ft torque from 1500 rpm is plenty in the real world, yielding 0-60 times just a fraction of a second behind a 6-pot. Yes, the P300's sound is more subdued but it still pops and burbles on higher-rev shifts, especially in Dynamic/Sport modes.",Jaguar

"Disagree. The F-Type is and will be a timeless classic. The Callum styling, the unadulterated roar at start up, throwing it into a corner and feeling like you‚Äôre almost going to fishtail it before the traction control kicks in.

"1. These cars aren't badged differently for long or short wheel base. If the sale advert doesn't specify, you'll just have to look at the length of the thing. The LWB has noticeably more room for the rear passengers.

2. The supercharged one is considerably faster. It might be technically possible to upgrade an NA one, but it'll probably be a lot cheaper and easier to just buy a supercharged one to begin with if that's what you want.

3. Mileage is not an issue on these as long as they're cared for. As long as it comes with a good service history it's not unusual to see these things go hundreds of thousands of km without major issues. They'll be suffering a lot of generic ""20 year old car problems"" by now, but they're generally robust.

4. X350 refers to any of the first gen of this era, 2003-2006 ish.  
X358 is the facelift model from 2007-2009.  
X356 was a stopgap year, with most of the 350 styling but some under the hood upgrades from the 358.  
Super V8 and XJR are both supercharged, everything else is just trim spec.

5. I don't know about switching drive side on these specifically, but I imagine it's probably more expensive than the value of the car itself if you get a professional to do it. Maybe if you can find a donor car being sold off for scrap it might be feasible, but just be easier to find one that's already on the side you want. They're not that rare yet",Jaguar

I've had it 18 months and do 11,000 miles per year.   


I've only had 3 issues:

\-I've had to replace a wheel hub after the bearing needed replacing but it had rusted into it (very common problem) I think this cost me ¬£650 after finding a used hub on ebay.

\-The underside needed some welding after a hole rusted through it. Cost about ¬£300.

\- My mass air flow sensor needs a clean every 6 months. It causes a ""Restricted performance"" warning.  I can do this myself. Takes 15 minutes.  


I'm a bit on the fence if this car is worth the cost of petrol which is about ¬£3,000 per year.  I'd rather get terrible MPGs driving an Aston Martin.

Unless they can offer something special in an increasingly over saturated market, I don't envision it doing well. My prediction is after 5-10 years of gradual decline in sales numbers, they will get absorbed into Land Rover and.that's it.

"At the age of the car you will want to get it on a lift and remove the plastic undertray to check for coolant leaks from the rear heater crossover pipe.These are sonic welded plastic and they age quickly and tend to split , weeping coolant down the sides of the transmission.If that pipe lets loose, by the time the idiot light comes on you've pretty well killed your motor.

All of the other hard plastic hoses in the cooling system are old enough they should be changed as well as the header tank.Try to look just past the throttle body intake with a slim flashlight , you'll probably see oil and coolant have leaked onto the torx screws holding the oil cooler to the crankcase.Pretty common after three or four years regardless of mileage and it's a bitch to fix as the supercharger has to be pulled to replace all the pipes.I just did it on my 15 XFS, changed all the plastic out for aluminum so it can be made much more robust, you just have to either spend the money to have a good indie shop do it or if you don't mind wrenching do it yourself.

I would not waste your money on any warranty, 3rd party or from Jaguar as they will not cover any of the plastic or rubber wear items ( that's everything) under the hood so better to put that money aside for any fixes .

It's an awesome car, designed to be leased for three years and then auctioned off.They make a killing on servicing these cars since Jaguar won't replace just the little piece that's failed, they will only replace entire assemblies.I am not trying to wreck your day or talk you out of the car, but these thing die if they are not driven daily and maintained religiously.I love Jags, learned to drive on a '72 E-Type and have owned a few of them over the decades, but I go into it eyes wide open.",Jaguar

They are an option yes, the thing is that in the US  most of the cars have a high spec so it‚Äôs kinda normal that you only see them with the xenon headlights.

Super powerful too. I had a 2009 XK before. I loved it but wanted more power. One thing about the XK line is that they are quieter and more easy going. They can still get up any move.",Jaguar

"I think a G-type based on 5.0 V8 with electric supercharging and turbocharging could have done 650 HP+ at $120K+. In addition, all Jaguar really needed to add to sales volume was a second generation F-Pace,  a three-row J-Pace, and a new XJ, which could have been electric.

Instead, they hired a French idiot with zero automotive background. He completely ripped Jaguar's product planning apart in a short tenure, and then got fired. The irony is, Jaguar is still pursuing that fired French idiot's dream, even as all competitors are walking back on their EV plans..",Jaguar
"Tbh I love the car. I only wish they had put more money into the screens (processing power, RAM, or both). They are so, so slow - especially for one of their most expensive vehicles. It is a First Edition (2019) and I know they did some updating in later years, it could be better now. I had a 2024 F-Pace loaner during the H441 recall, and the response of the new screens is incredible compared to my I-Pace. Pivi Pro is a massive upgrade over what I currently have.

Otherwise, the car has never left me stranded. Fast, pulls extremely hard, and extremely comfortable. Absolutely love it. Eats tires though.",Jaguar

"The new stuff will be fine. But consumables for the AJ34S (hoses, seals, clips, etc‚Äîanything rubber or plastic) are already hard to find, and I suspect the AJ133 will follow suit. Hopefully without Jaguar to get in the way, some suppliers will step up.",Jaguar
"To be fair, you could make the same argument about Porsche. Porsche was losing money in the 80s and 90s, and their sports car purist heritage wasn't paying the bills. 928s, 944s, and 911 sales volumes were going stale or sour, and it was facing potential bankruptcy. While the release of Boxster helped initially, the sales slowed again in a few years and Porsche management at that time decided to do the unthinkable: make an SUV with a Porsche badge. While all original Porsche fans cried foul, it was the first generation Cayenne that saved Porsche as a profitable entity.

Did Porsche lose its purist identity by going into soccer mom market of Macans and Cayennes? Sure, but it paid the bills and the consumers didn't look down on Porsche just because they were selling SUVs, a far cry from purist sports car brand for much of its history.

The point is, Jaguar needed a three-row SUV to improve its sales volumes. Jaguar also needed a newer second-gen F-Pace to pay the bills, but the management dropped the ball. Today's Porsche isn't just about 911s, and consumers still buy all sorts of Porsches outside of the sports car base. Surely, Jaguar should not be about just big sedans and big coupes either. They should have gone all-in on SUV craze, and be the sportier and lighter Range Rovers to differentiate.",Jaguar
This is the most jaguar owner thing I‚Äôve ever seen,Jaguar
"The previous comments have already given you the primer you need, I just thought I‚Äôd address the manual gearbox thing. 

Likely someone told you that you could get one, or you read it somewhere. And indeed for many years, you could get a manual XJ from Jaguar, but the last model to be offered was the X300.  It ceased production in 1997, being replaced by the X308.  

The S-Type and X-Type could be had with a manual in their lesser engine offerings. But as far as I know, it was limited to the the six cylinder diesels and small petrol sixes. The 3.0L V6 was the  biggest petrol engine that got a manual from the factory. 

None of the juicy V8s ever got them, other then some technical exercises or custom work.",Jaguar

"I bought mine at  Caravana and took it to the dealership during the he warranty period. The service writer at Jaguar said he had never had a warranty claim rejected by Silverlake, the warranty company Carvana uses. They did over $7000 in work to the car in the first 90 days and then the car was great for a year.

Took it on a drive in the mountains and a coolant pipe cracked. Managed to get it home and got aluminum coolant pipes installed at a cost of $2200.  A couple months later I took it for a drive in the mountains and an injector stuck open. I was out of cell range and had to limp to a gas station. Tow was $700 and 3 new injectors, spark plugs and an oil change was $2200 at my mechanic. Three weeks an injector in the other bank failed closed - replaced those three for $1300 - I supplied the parts. Latest issue will cost me about $1200 for a new thermostat housing, and another $1800 for a transmission service (pan/filter and fluid), diff service, AC charge, new air filters (the cost of this is robbery), and fixing an exhaust leak.  And I supplied all the parts ($375ish).  My son and I will do the oil change which luckily is easy to do from the top with an extractor. Oil and a filter is $125.

"I never get why all that fear of some makers or newer cars. It is just an older car and there will be suspension and related stuff wear. That is more or less the same on all cars. Except they use some unobtanium parts like arms with integrated ball joints what are no longer available. 
Same with that fear of ‚Äúmodern‚Äù engines and transmissions. It is just a lump of metal. Seals will go bad over time and cause problems. People used to realize it but as old mechanic are scared of wires and new ones relying solely on diagnostic what tends to be totally confused when things like vacuum leaks started. Older modern cars have a big problem. 
I know that from my S Type. Seals around injections were bad causing all sorts of problems. Diagnostic show misfiring and throttle body malfunction. Guess what will 99% of services do.

Ultimately, with Jaguar completely changing their product lineup, distribution network, and pricing/marketing strategy in the next 2 years, don't expect them to go back up in numbers in the near-term.

"At that age/mileage, the viability of the engine will greatly depend on the unknown of how well the previous owner(s) treated it. It could have had a common coolant system failure from the plastic pipes bursting, and depending on how the previous owner handled it, the owner could have driven it all the way home overheating and the heads could have been warped and they filled the coolant system with head gasket leak goop to get it to last long enough to sell. Or the owner could have immediately pulled over and shut down the engine and had it towed and repaired before any engine damage. Or the owner could have been really on top of it, and had the plastic proactively replaced before those bits gave out. But very unlikely the original plastic pipes would have lasted all this time/mileage.

I turn it off and 30 minutes later no fault but it is some time later it may appear. I had booked it in today for a local service but when I rang no answer and went to see them later, he couldn't help and have to wait another month. It is intermittent so I have no idea. I am hoping it's a faulty sensor so I am curious if people have a similar experience.

"The most important thing is to go in and have fun. They aren‚Äôt mechanically that different from their Deutsch counterparts, so there will be no nasty surprises. Maintaining them can be a bit tricky, but not overly so. My advice would be to find a good Indy, but if you buy with warranty, you should be golden for the foreseeable future anyway.

The rest depends on what kind of engine you put in it. The P300 in my opinion is an inferior choice simply due to the Volkswagenesque noise that it makes. The V8 has a lot more theatre. On the other hand, the spicier versions can be a little tail happy under acceleration, so make sure that you‚Äôre a good enough driver if you go for one of those.

My pick of the bunch would be a P380 (if available) or a P450. 

Afterwards, you need to find a good twisting mountain road, drive there, and hammer the throttle.",Jaguar
"A combination of brand awareness and identity. Jaguars originally were old-fashioned luxury cars for old people. Ford changed their image to more modern luxury cars with some old traits. Also, Jaguars were less expensive than its competitors, but still seen as luxury and with a strong identity.

Tata made them just bland (besides the F Type) and has not put any effort to market them in an efficient way. Now they want to move to an all electric lineup, so they have even less incentive to promote their current range. Also, people have moved from sedans to SUV's.",Jaguar

"I wouldn't say that. Actually Tata has been pretty good with it. Quality is improved, designs have actually been quite good.  At least in the first 8-10 years of Tata ownership.  Jag/LR worldwide revenues were highest in 2018, 10 years into Tata ownership. So I'm hesitant to just pin it on India.

That said, the big picture strategy is changing dramatically. That's been known externally for the last 3yrs at least. Internally, probably longer than that. And since that strategy has started creeping into decisions over the last, call it 3-5yrs, Jaguar has been allowed to kind of go stale and shrink.  Whether the new strategy will be successful remains to be seen with the new models (very little publicly released about that). I personally think it's a doomed strategy that Jaguar won't survive a decade+. But my take on that has a much to do with further adoption of EVs and government regulations, as it does with anything specifically Jaguar.  We'll see what Mardell can do with it.",Jaguar

"It sucks to see, especially with the death of some wonderful engines, and some playful cars, be it the XF, the F Type, or the F Pace SVR. Even the I Pace I thought was pretty cool. 

They've been a niche brand for a while, something I'd feel you'd cross shop with something like Alfa or even Maserati. They have about as much personality. But neither Ford nor Tata seemed to know how to sell them. I'm not sure if going more upmarket will be a good move. There is some historical precedence, back when they were an expensive but still cost effective alternative to Bentley and Aston. But I'm not sure Jaguar still carries that one time prestige. They don't really have that old world money/luxury vibe either that was unique, and they failed to play up that hooliganism they once had too. Jags had the weird ability to be classy and shifty at the same time (a great movie villain car). 

Will be curious to see what Tata considers upmarket for Jag. As a Jag enthusiast, here's to hoping for something successful.",Jaguar

a) still use a main dealer for service and maintenance on a 12 year old car - find a general mechanic or a marque specialist. Or

b) expect a decent price from a dealer on trade in or part ex.

"Even with the old Touch Duo Pro, living with CarPlay or AA covers up many sins.  I almost never deal with the car's UI for nav or infotainment.  Keep in mind that some features are not available on models after 2021 due to supply chain issues (360 camera, HUD and driver assist come to mind).  Personally, the 360 camera is the only ""must have"" on that list for me.

As for long range trips, that is not the I Pace's strong suit (but that's true for most EV's except some Teslas like the M3LR).  The I Pace was designed to protect the longevity of the battery by (a) aggressively maintaining the temperature of the battery pack which shortens range; and (b) throttling the speed of level three charging.  I'm active on multiple I Pace forums and you rarely see complaints about battery degradation.  Like every EV that uses LG battery packs (e.g., the Chevy Bolt), there have been pack failures covered by warranty, but in general the range on the battery packs have remained steady.  Hang out on a Tesla forum and the story is different.

Your real life experience on a long trip in an I Pace is the you leave with a full charge and get about 200 miles before recharging.  Assuming you get a good charger (not guaranteed in a non-Tesla), you'll see a reasonable charging rate up to 80% of battery capacity.  At that point, to protect the battery pack, the I Pace will throttle the charging speed and unless it saves you a charging session, it makes sense to stop the charge and continue on your journey.  The problem is that you are leaving with an 80% charge so you'll need to stop again in 150 miles for another session.

The bottom line is that I take my wife's ICE on longer trips.  Unless I can reach my destination with one charging stop and return with at most one charging stop (i.e., I have access to destination charging), the kitty stays home.  If the I Pace would be your only vehicle and you regularly take long trips, I'd think twice.  In fact, I don't recommend EVs at all unless you can charge at home and have access to an ICE or hybrid.",Jaguar

The downside is while not that hard to work on is they didn't make that many to start with so while I do my own work there aren't many if any in the local wrecking yards so at time some parts are a little harder to source.

3 years into owning a first gen S. Still love driving it.  Absolutely brilliant platform with the 380hp and ZF8. Drives far closer to a sports sedan than anything that size has a right to.,Jaguar
Agree. They still can get an edge since performance won‚Äôt be the key selling point anymore but focusing on design however. I believe this will be what‚Äôs important to consumers in the future.,Jaguar
"Because Aston Martin is far more expensive than Jaguar...

"Hopefully the image works 

It some how ended up at a CarMax in Minnesota and I had it transferred to one in Illinois. Test drove it and it felt fine and no immediate issues. Waiting for the new Illinois title before I can continue with purchase. The quick ownership changes towards the end have me a little concerned.",Jaguar
"I disagree with the EV variant approach. If they do that, they're going to have to make design compromises going in both directions. The EV variant would have compromises to accommodate the ICE variant and vice versa. You'd end up with two mediocre cars.

If they want to really knock the EV models out of the park, it would be best for them to do a ground up EV design, in my opinion.",Jaguar
Yup. The plastic key slot cover on the boot/trunk on my 2011 XF has Volvo printed on it.,Jaguar
"The thing is the V8 offered more power and better fuel economy while being cheaper to make weigh less and was less complex even with the upgraded fuel and ignition system with the 6.0 engines. I would have loved a V12 XK or XJ but that just wasn't going to happen going into the 00's. The AJV8 is Jaguar's best engine they ever made and the best engine they will ever make considering they are going full EV now. Not sure how they will differentiate themselves between everyone else now because all the motors are going to be pretty much the same other then their power rating. 

The inline 6 and the V6 are kind of the same and even the 4 cylinder to some degree considering fuel economy isn't a vast improvement over the V8 in the real world unless you are driving in a city all the time. I would think if they had moved from a supercharger to a turbocharger the fuel economy on the forced induction cars would improve greatly although it would be nice if they had still offered a supercharger. 

I think it would have been a better idea to have stuck with a single engine for all their cars with various versions of that engine going from 4.2-5.0 with either supercharged, naturally asspirated and turbocharged. I don't knof if it was possible for the engine was a diesel option would have been a cool idea or perhaps just take an off the shelf diesel engine instead of designing a whole new engine from scratch. The V6 was a half assed engine anyway considering it's just the same block as the V8 with the front two cylinders blanked off.",Jaguar
What are they,Jaguar
Don't blame the XK120.  Isadora Duncan was riding in an Amilcar CGSs when she was killed.,Jaguar

"I can see why dealers are giving up their franchises. If its 9000 cars annually, there is no way this is sustainable for most dealers. The question becomes what happens to current owners. I assume they can just go to a Land Rover dealership to get parts and service? Otherwise Jaguar is truly putting out their existing customers in a bad spot.",Jaguar
"Yeah, you can get by with multiple small soft bags, but that makes it more difficult.",Jaguar
You‚Äôre gonna need a long one for that big ol kitty lol,Jaguar
"I‚Äôm sure E Types were dirt cheap in the 70‚Äôs as well. Outside of super cars, it‚Äôs a pretty easy trend to follow. Depreciates like any other car to maybe 30% of original MSRP. After 15-20 years, expect what people consider a classic to start rising. I guarantee great condition lower mileage F Types to be no less than $70k in the next 10 years",Jaguar
Tata ruined them in my opinion,Jaguar
I can agree with this. The plan was to make a couple of short formats like this to appeal to younger folks. Plus doing a cinematic style longer video with more ¬´fitting¬ª music,Jaguar
"Jaguar sells an OEM one, and Jag Madness has one.  I am not familiar with the Fitcamx.  Going to have to google that one.",Jaguar
"Is part availablility an issue?

Yeah I am not loaded nor have money to throw at it, but I would be happy doing fixes and maintenance of tasks on my own. 

This is sensible advice though, one plan I did consider was keeping the Mini and buying a cheap XJ as a side project.  Thank you :)",Jaguar
"Your car is only ‚Äúworth‚Äù what someone will pay for it.  Either as a whole, broken down for parts, or crushed for scrap metal.  That is the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù.

Those cars are so beautiful,Jaguar
And long may she reign. My mates wife had her heart set on one but after I showed him the reviews she ended up going with an Audi q5. F Pace looks miles better. I do love the look and sound of the SVR model though. Mates got a new defender and that‚Äôs already started to play up.,Jaguar
I miss my jag‚Ä¶ BMW is really boring,Jaguar
Beautiful. What color is this?,Jaguar
What a sweet exhaust note though,Jaguar
"If the reimagined brand is all EV like we are expecting, I wont be buying another Jag ever again. Partly why I pulled the trigger on my current F-Type.",Jaguar
"personally, not a fan. aside from AMG, Jag makes a great sounding V8 exhaust

Historically, jag has never been successful at implementing new tech, or any tech at all....hence i fear the use of electric at scale. 

while, they're already a small player in very large market (internal combustion engine). they'll be moving into a more niche market...i dont think they're going to get the acceptance they're expecting

lastly, the brand is synonymous with ""electric issues""....any time you ask anyone about the brand, the first thing mentioned is ""oh they have electric issues"" (a reputation acquired from the 80s)....ironic that they're moving into that space",Jaguar
"Always go Oem wheels on Jaguar, you have XK/R rims to choose from also. Used with good tires are always cheaper and far better quality unless you‚Äôre spending multiple thousands.",Jaguar

"Just wanted to say I have the saloon version with the same engine and I love it. When testing it out, check every little bit of the electrics work.

"I came from German cars also. A lot of similarities, but Jaguar is so agile and sounds like nothing else. They‚Äôre a lot like modern German cars to work on; you can even do the same extractor pump oil changes. 

The F-Type, particularly V6 and V8, are overall solid cars. The coolant crossover pipe is a known problem, best to replace it preventatively instead of a surprise bad coolant leak. In general, don‚Äôt ignore any coolant leaks or warnings. I have seen occasional differential issues on the V6, not sure if that‚Äôs a fluke or something more common, but should be covered under warranty. Do the oil changes when needed, top tier premium gas only, and you‚Äôre fine. If you buy used, Certified Pre-Owned is the best bet for extended warranty since it‚Äôs from Jaguar. 

The real secret to Jaguar: drive the car. F-Types, when getting driven, are pretty reliable cars and so much fun. Put snow tires on, you‚Äôre fine all winter. And enjoy having a car that‚Äôs an uncommon sight on the road!",Jaguar
Blacked out paint job and rims with beige interior and top that wouldnt look like a granny car,Jaguar
"2016 newer is the best option.¬†Upgraded TFT display cluster,¬†Soft close doors as standard and shouldn't have any timing chain issues. There is an upgraded version of the cooling system pipes that are metal instead of plastic. The rear return plastic pipe, metal upgrade is only currently available for the V6. Probably a good idea to flush the cooling system and replace the hoses and plastic pipes. The last XJ left the factory nearly 5 years ago so they're getting old now. Good luck.¬†",Jaguar
The kit I bought has a slot in the module for the footwell lights so best to purchase the entire kit including the footwell lights . Would work out cheaper as shipping would be costly,Jaguar
"agreed, but he said other Jaguar dealers texted him(the writer of the tweet) confirming all of this and adding even more context.  

I knew they were going to pare back their dealer network and go all EV.  But all of this sounds much more ominous than just that.  And it says first new Jag EV won't be out until 2026, which is in direct contradiction to what JLR NA CEO just said in interviews a week or so ago.",Jaguar

Honestly, if you were concerned about reliability and reviews, I don't know how you go to a Q5 from an F-Pace.  Not sure that was a move in the right direction.

The Ingenium engines are not likely to be more reliable than the AJ-V8. I would do oil changes every 7500 miles or one year whichever comes first and save myself the headache.

"I have one. I'm in the US w/ a 3.0 AWD Wagon. Honestly, unless you just really want AWD, the Wagon, or a 3.0 Manual Sport, I'd say no. The AWD system is good, the Wagons are cool and useful, and a 3.0 Manual Sport would be a pretty decent and potent sports sedan.

It misses out on some of that ""Jag"" feeling you get from the larger cars, and, at least on V6 AWD cars (idk anything about the diesels), they basically shoehorned that drivetrain in there and it makes servicing some parts a pain in the ass.

The XJ of the era gives you more of that ""Jag"" feeling, more space, full aluminum so rust isn't a worry, you get the same styling, and (in my region/country) they're really not that different in price. Even the S-Type gives you longitudinal RWD driving characteristics (although i'd probably still take an XJ because there's no price premium for an XJ in my area).

If you decide to look at one: The sills/rockers rust out badly, the plastic side skirts trap and hold water and it rusts them out badly from the inside. Transfer cases on AWD models aren't the strongest, so I'd look into servicing it sooner rather than later (they only hold like half a cup of fluid, so if they leak at all they'll run dry, and the fluid gets worn out quick). Pre-04 use a viscous coupling transfer case and they're beasts off road and in deep snow and etc, but they're not that strong, hence the fluid recommendation. 04+ use a stronger transfer case, but it's basically an open center diff... I wouldn't buy one if it doesn't have traction control (there'll be a button for it next to the cupholders); Without Traction Control to do wheel braking, it's a pretty useless system... They're not as ""capable"" as early cars, but the traction control system is very good and I might actually prefer it if you're just driving on snowy/slushy roads.

Also the 5-Speed Jatco transmission is a weak link. Service them regularly, or you'll start having issues. If serviced regularly they're not terrible, but it still dampens the experience significantly compared to a manual IMHO.",Jaguar

"Great advice. I had a tuned 5.0 Supercharged in an XF and it was a monster. I can't imagine that same engine in a much smaller, lighter car. The Jag V6/V8s are good motors with a few quirks. The main issue is the cooling system. It uses brittle plastic that can crack over time, and there is a seam welded plastic crossover coolant pipe in the back of the engine that's hard to get to. The water pumps suck too, I went through 2 in mine over 40k miles, but it never overheated.

Change the oil every 5k miles to help keep the chain tensioners clean. There's a small tube in the oil fill hole you can use to suck the oil out if you have a vacuum pump. I did a couple of oil changes myself and it was super easy with almost no mess.",Jaguar

Could even be a possibility of a knackered O2 sensor that was on the verge of becoming 'less in spec' aka defective but unlikely since it isn't a **slow rich to lean or lean to rich fault**. On the N/A market if i remember there was a recall for this which was a PCM update but since its a different DTC i wouldnt worry too much.

I wouldn't think it as a defective CAT as of now even if It did run like trash when the sensor was unplugged letting it sit with the misfire wont do much damage to the catalyst at all its when its driven with a misfire it potentially causes breakdown, they can be a bitch to remove also :\\

"Politics and international attitudes aside, there are plenty of reasons to be anti-Chinese cars. 

Chinese goods in general (not just their cars) use build materials that are sub-par and QC is awful. There is a reason the term Chinesium exists.

Ethically there are a host of other problems too. They are aggressively trade unfriendly (trade for me and not for thee), anyone who wants to be part of their market has to bend over backwards, kneel and kiss the ring. They blatantly steal IP and cut corners in every single way (it's easy to ""nail"" a formula when you steal from others). Happily completely undercutting local competition to drive them out of business. Workers rights and protections are non-existant, etc, etc. All while crying victim if anything is ever pointed out.

Affordable? Sure, but that affordability comes at a price.

"This engine, the worst ever imo, stretches the chain & if you don‚Äôt replace it once it does the start-up rattle, anything from ¬£750 to ¬£1500 depending on location, your engine will be toast.

Part of the reason for failure is the claimed oil change intervals, suggested 2yrs 24k though personally I say a Turbo Diesel should be done at 10k max. The other thought is failure‚Äôs caused by the diesel pump going into hysteresis causing stress to all parts in the chain system. A suggested solution is to disable the Stop/Start system 

No idea of replacement cost but I‚Äôd imagine on a 66 plate it will be financial toast too.

There are also other issues in the form of electrical issues like infotainment screens dying, seat, steering wheel & central locking motors, gear selector motors packing up too.

These things are a long way short of reliable & as a ‚Äòpremium‚Äô brand, repair costs can be frightening too so find a good specialist in your area & avoid the main dealers.

Personally I wouldn‚Äôt touch any JLR products with an ingenium engine but if you really want the car get a cast iron warranty, check T&C‚Äôs with a fine tooth comb for coverage & value of claims, purchase price is what you need there.

If a petrol engine works for you, they are a much safer option, electrics are still problematic though.

Otherwise, explain why they've held Royal Warrants for over 70 years, being first granted in 1951. You don't just receive a Royal Warrant for being a mediocre brand.

Even AM's V12 today traces its roots to Jaguar. All of AM's V8 used to be simple modifications of second-gen AJ-V8 from Jaguar. Although the current Vantage and DB11/12 utilizes Mercedes M177 V8 engine, much of Aston's engineering came from Jaguar. Most importantly, Aston Martin is bleeding worse than JLR today, and will likely file bankruptcy for the eighth time in its sad history.",Jaguar
Autologic is a aftermarket dealer alternative diagnostic computer and is going to be a very very expensive purchase. I would recommend you buy the topdon topscan just so you can read the suspension faults and go from there. Once you have the faults figured out find an independent shop that has the equipment to perform a ride height calibration if your height is off.  Most of the time suspension faults on that car are due to a bad air strut. I have experienced bad brand new aftermarket air struts plenty of times. If you have a circuit fault for a particular air strut ohm it out and compare it with the opposite side. Regarding height issues I have also experienced brand new aftermarket air struts being stuck in the fully raised position but that would produce a ride height that it way high not just a little. The electrical plug on the aftermarket air struts doesnt actually do anything since its not a real active shock in the aftermarket struts. Its just spoofing a resistance value.,Jaguar

I'd recommend getting either X300, X308, or X350/358 for classic Jaguar sedan design. If you're looking for a coupe X100 XK8 & 1992-1996 XJS I6 are great cars. I would avoid XJS V12 although since it sounds like you're in the UK parts will be much more available but still expensive. The V12 motor itself is great, just everything else around it will fail and go away. Parts are getting rarer and the knowledge to maintain these cars is getting lost to time. Being UK based you'd be better off than me in New York but I don't think it's worth the headache it will eventually give you. 

V8 & V6 powered Jags check for hoses, water pumps, & timing chains especially on pre 2002 X308 XJ8 & 5.0 supercharged jaguars. Same for V6 as it is the same engine with the last two cylinders filled in (early 2000s X and S Types & XJ6 use a very reliable ford derived engine). Inline six engine is really good and stout. Definitely would replace timing chain because of age and check hoses too. 

If you want something modern/current please avoid the turbodiesel Ingenium engines. They are unreliable and prone to blowing up at random mileage. I wouldn't even consider one of those even though they make excellent power and return great fuel efficiency.

Try one out! Find a listing and take a test drive. If you fall in love buy it and don't look back. Life is too short and too busy to pass up on an opportunity like this. Also please post pictures if you do get one!",Jaguar

"The petrol engines are generally very reliable, although AWD transfer boxes are weak. The diesels are frequently troublesome although the engine cores themselves are fairly strong for both 2.0 and 2.2 4-cylinders - it's everything bolted to them which gives grief (injector failures, EGR problems, turbocharger actuators, dual mass flywheel failures etc etc).

Parts prices are generally fairly inexpensive.

Where they're all extremely vulnerable is sill and subframe corrosion. Subframes are fairly easy to see. Sills rot from the inside out and can be in an appalling state internally before rust blows through to the outside. Most are subjected to exceptionally bad repairs to patch over holes to stagger through an MOT and be sold.

Generally they all look pretty good condition standing looking at it, but it can be a total rotbox underneath.

Look for one which has had a fairly expensive and comprehensive job of rebuilding the sills properly on both sides, ideally with photographic evidence to prove both that the work was done to rebuild the internals of the sill structures but also that it was comprehensively cleaned of rust and properly painted internally as it was done. If you see one covered in underseal, run away.",Jaguar
"Front crossover tubes. IN ALUMINUM. Your Jaguar has plastic ones. Higher mileage ones will split, fail, and blow your engine if you dont catch it in time. If you smell even a whiff of antifreeze underhood, do it.

If the cars hold up well in long term, and smaller sedans are still a thing, for the value and imo the looks it could retain more value than previously thought

"My XFR-S which I bought new 10 years ago was the last Jaguar I had any interest in owning. They have produced nothing since which appeals. The F-Type is a bit heavy and compromised (all those motoring journalists who said it was TVR-like evidently had zero first hand experience of TVRs) and even when they did release a manual gearbox version which should have been the sweet spot they buggered it up. Then they ""facelifted"" it and utterly ruined the only thing it excelled at - looking good. They dropped the XK and never replaced it. The X351 XJ is a weird looking thing that proved unreliable. The XE steered nicely, but felt cheap and the dropped the only engine I'd ever have considered buying - I will never own a Jaguar with a 4-pot engine. The next XF was a joke of a car. The whatever-Pace cars are badge engineering yummy-mummy cars.

I'm not anti-EV per se, but an electric drivetrain holds zero interest. I don't mind owning cars I have no interest in and indeed do own a couple out of my 6 car total which are merely A to B transport. However, the appeal in owning such uninteresting cars for me personally is that they are ridiculously cheap to own and run.

For me then, Jaguar having already divested of anything which could possibly appeal to me whilst also trying to position themselves to sell even more expensive cars merely means that I will never set foot in a Jaguar showroom or spend time on their website again.

I probably will buy another Jaguar car at some point, but it will be another old one. Of the 6 I've owned, I still have 3 and the youngest is 18 years old. The 2014 XFR-S didn't last long - it was costing too much and wasn't exciting enough for the money. The reality of powerful every-day cars and particularly ones ruined with automatic gearboxes is that once the initial honeymoon is over it gets put in Drive and driven the same as the base model would be only costing twice as much in fuel.",Jaguar

"Does he have an XJS coupe or an XJ6/12 sedan? Like the other commenter posted 90's cars are at the bottom of their lifetime value right now. 

If he has an XJS in decent to pristine condition the prices can vary depending on powertrain. The 4.0 6-cylinder is much more coveted due to its reliability over the V12. I've seen nice examples at around $20-$25k online. The V12 models I've seen go for as little as $5,000 in used condition to $15,000 in mint condition. 

The 90's XJ sedan models go between $5,000 - $15,000 but it's wholly dependent on the condition of the car. Trim level also is a factor. You could probably get more out of it if it's a Vanden Plas or Daimler. If it's an R spec XJ in exceptional condition you could fetch $25k.

After reading much back and forth here on whether to replace with original air suspension or coil-over I decided on the known and with with air.  Very pleased.  One thing to consider is that the computer-assisted-suspension-adjustment-within-milliseconds (CATS) capability had to go because you get that only with OEM struts (i.e., Bilstein), which cost I think at least three times as much as Arnotts; not OEM but are high quality replacements.  This effectively disabled CATS.  Have I noticed any difference in any way?  No.  Ride quality and handling seem the same and are excellent.

Probably TMI for the new shopper.  Moving on.  Car is extremely smooth and quiet at all speeds including 10-20 mph over highway speeds, which seems to be its happy place.  Wind noise is negligible, as is road/tire noise.  Overtaking on a two-lane highway is a joy because when you stick your foot in it, the big beast lunges and rushes up past 100 mph in no time, solid and stable as the Bank of England.  Handling in corners is very brisk and sure for such a heavy car.  Seats extremely comfortable for the long road trip.  Surprisingly good gas mileage (I have the naturally aspirated 4.2L engine; the supercharged version is understandably worse but who cares).

Aside from the rear air suspension mentioned above (which included a new compressor), I replaced the headliner ($1000) at a reputable local shop, sway bar bushings, front brake pads, various systems' fluids, etc.  I didn't get any maintenance records with the car but the two Jag mechanics at my European repair shop say mine was obviously cared for and I'm continuing that.  They see many older Jags like mine that the owners have driven the hell out of and clearly never did scheduled, routine, preventive maintenance or repair (especially supercharged models; go figure).  But you gotta drive 'em.  They don't respond well to sitting around.  Would I like to have 400 supercharged HP instead of a ""mere"" 300?  You bet.  But I'm more than content.  Also, the mechanics say ""you got the right engine,"" from their experience anyway.

Good luck to your uncle.  For comfort and luxury on a long trip I give the 2007 XJ 10/10.  Just remember that maintenance for a European luxury car is going to be expensive compared with Japanese or American rates, which are probably what he's used to.  If it has to be at a dealer, it will be downright ruinous.  Ideally he can find a reputable shop with good, experienced mechanics.  I count my lucky stars on that.",Jaguar
It‚Äôs funny how my daily driver never has anything bad happen to it but my FType with barely any miles on it gets put through the wringer. C‚Äôest La Vie.,Jaguar
"If they don‚Äôt have receipts or won‚Äôt pay to have it confirmed it wasn‚Äôt done. 

Btw, the ‚Äúfast‚Äù check by removing the valve cover only proves 1 of 4 tensioners have been done and 0 of 4 guides. Likely all done but sometimes only upper tensioners are done.",Jaguar
The sunroof drains are routed down both pillars and it's usually a tube that runs down to each wheel well so a hole in those tubes can cause water to show up anywhere in the dash but definitely check both AC drain and sunroof and make sure the windshield seal isn't messed up,Jaguar

"The biggest weakness is the 5 speed automatic gearbox.  Failures are quite common.  Transfer case is a weak point as well.  However, Jaguar retroactively changed their service recommendation from being ‚Äúsealed for life‚Äù to occasionally dropping the pan and replacing the fluid.  That seems to have cured most transfer case issues.

The manual gearbox is rare, but worth looking for just for the reliability.

"The most reliable and classically styled Jags are going to be X300 (1995-1997) and X350/358 (2004-2010). 

X300 is a straight six tied to a four speed GM automatic that is bulletproof. Engine itself is exceptionally reliable although you'd want to check over coolant pipes and valve covers as any car that old. It's a steel body jag so it will rust (my X308 is fighting this winter now) so definitely keep that in mind if you live in an area that heavily salts roads during the winter. These are low slung cars so ingress and egress is a bit uncomfortable for taller people and the backseat is abysmally small. Headliner will sag, leather will tend to age very nicely, and the veneers should be in good shape given limited UV exposure. 

X350/358 is a V8 powered car. This generation came with a 4.2 liter that is an excellent engine. Make sure to check out coolant pipes and water pumps. This generation is aluminum body so it will not rust away although surface level corrosion of the paint can occur causing unsightly bubbling. High trim cars such as Vanden Plas or XJR came equipped with air suspension. These typically fail and are costly to repair. Many owners opt for coils after failure. Interior ergonomics are much improved. Actual usable rear seats, easier ingress/egress, and proper cup holders.",Jaguar

You don't know what you are trying to fix if you don't have the fault code. Guessing and replacing parts can introduce new issues such as touching the height sensor and not recalibrating the height after....you can get something cheap that can read air suspension faults.

"I don't really see any other path forward

Sedans are pretty much dead, and there's an entire SUV brand in that same company.... So you really can't compete with yourself.

And, quite frankly, they just don't have the resources to compete in the mass market with companies who can innovate constantly, do refreshes every couple of years, new platforms every five to six years, advanced engines, etc (BMW, Merc, Audi, etc). If you can't beat them in those regards, you have to make the cars cheaper, which is hard to do if you're not selling them at volume, and hurts your image even further even if you do sell it cheaper.

It was possible back during the Ford era because they had Ford money (although it arguably hurt the brand image moving down market), and were not in this tech driven world now, so you could just make a nice luxury car and compete. Now you've got tech, battery technology, and other factors.

I think going up market is the only way forward. Go back to Jaguar of old of making large luxurious cars, abandon the mass market, go for low volume high end desirable product",Jaguar

They should not be ending all their current models, and introducing brand new, EV only models. They should've slowly offered EV variants of all current models as proof of concept, then slowly rolled out the new, EV only models.

Also, I think moving the price up is a mistake. At the price range they are entering, most people will look towards other brands.

"The brand has stigma (still) around its wiring issues and mechanical issues from the 70s - 90s. Its been years, nay a generation, since those issues were regular with their vehicles, but alas, people have disengaged with brand but also, they were never a dominating powerhouse like Ford/GMC/Chevy and related brands both domestic and international. I think its a good thing.

You see, Jaguar is a luxury car brand first and foremost but before I delve deeper I want to be careful by what I mean by luxury and first and foremost.

Luxury, defined as what is rare, expensive, refined and exquisite. Luxury items existed for thousands of years, but the production of luxury items as an industry began in 17th century under the leadership of Louis XIV and Jean-Baptiste Colbert in France and then brought into England predominately by Charles Frederick Worth. Using this idea, I would assert that France was original founder of the luxury tradition and England was more so responsible for its export around the world in the centuries that followed.

For this reason, I personally only consider Jaguar, Bentley, and Rolls Royce as the only 'real' luxury automative brands. Partially due to their adjacency to the tradition as well as their premiere/initial focus on luxury vehicles... vs others like Aston Martin, etc that started as something else and then moved into the luxury space. Granted one could call out brands like Cadillac, Maseratti, etc but being a bit biased I am reluctant to include them in the luxury tradition of vehicles. 

Which brings me to my point on why we don't see them as much around and why that is a benefit to the brand. 

Luxury is meant to be rare. Exquisite. Refined. These are all words I use to describe the brand. If you were to regularly find Jaguars on the road, in parking lots, etc. you would likely say to someone, if they asked, that seeing a Jaguar is a common occurrence. 

Common is not compatible with rare.

This elevates them within the tradition of what it means to be defined as luxury. 

For me, the rarity and engagement of neighbors, friends, family, when I pull out one of my Jaguars is always a great time and lets me hit the sweet spot of being an enthusiast driver and owner without shelling enormous amounts of for horsepower I will never legally use or other options sets to make the car rare and special. It is rare and special because it is a Jaguar and for me that is more than enough.",Jaguar

I had an XKR for awhile, but I prefer the lines of the XK-8.  To me, it's the last Jag that really feels like a *JAAAAAAAGGG*.  


Did I read that you got the front shock mounts and bushings done already?  Looking at your pics, it looks like she's starting to significantly sag on you on the front end.  At 100K miles, if you haven't had this done yet--it's time.  If  you plan to keep it for the long haul, it wouldn't kill you to think about going all the way and replacing the front ball joints as well.  (Common failure point.)  You're going to feel a vastly improved ride just doing the shock mounts and bushings though.  Pay somebody to do this if you must, but honestly you can do this yourself with a few basic tools that you can rent from Auto Zone and a jack.

It had just shy of 23k miles, and now it has 26k miles. Absolutely love it. I've had no issues with it. I work from home, so I haven't been putting the miles on it much.

That being said, you get a 5 year factory warranty, and 1 year cpo if you buy used. Is it a waste to buy a jag and leave on the driveway? Maybe? But then again, if you have a low mileage car, it'll retain it's value, especially if it's like an f type, or an r/svr model.

At that point, would you feel better spending less on a toyota that's also going to sit on the driveway? Or rather spend more on the more luxurious car that will also sit on the driveway?

"That drivetrain is Jag‚Äôs best motor, and has been known to run 300k+. I had a supercharged one in a 4.2 XKR and it was one of the best drivetrains I‚Äôve ever owned. HOWEVER, it (and the car it‚Äôs attached to) will need major services from time to time. I would say my 07 XKR generally cost $4-7k in general maintenance/repairs/work per year, and there‚Äôs nothing that would make an S-Type be any different than that. 

Was it worth it? To me, in the XKR, absolutely. But they are older cars that will need vacuum hoses and fluid changes and all the maintenance that comes along with keeping any 20-year-old car on the road.",Jaguar
"2003 and up will be the X350 model with the superior 4.2 v8 and will have the 6-speed ZF box which is bulletproof. They also have an aluminium chassis, so rust isn't an issue. Otherwise, yeah, whatever issues you can imagine a 20 year old british luxury cruiser can have, it might.",Jaguar

"Sadly, I'm not surprised by this. When a brand throws away all its sports car/luxury heritage and foolishly tries to compete with the germans on their own turf for the soulless middle management crowd, it isn't gonna end well.

They had carved themselves a comfortable market niche for decades in which they just had to build the XJ, XK, and maybe the F-Type as a high end toy. They simply needed to use the deep pockets of their parent company to make them as best as they could be, and transition to EV when it's clearly the time instead of pointlessly rushing it while the path is still very uncertain.

I know that running an automaker is a monumentally complex task, but it's almost harder to fuck it up so profoundly as TATA have done with Jaguar. I hope they manage to sell them to somebody who can understand what the brand is about.",Jaguar

Using dynamic mode to stiffen the suspension on twisty roads is good fun.

When you want to overtake on the motorway it'll happily accelerate from 60 like it is nothing. The automatic gearbox likes to cruise in high gears though, so switch to sport to make it drop a gear before you put your foot down, otherwise you make a lot of noise while not pulling away for a couple of seconds and you look like a knob.

"Hi !

I recently bought a XE 2020 P250S regular version (not the R-Dynamik).  It was a bit of an impulsive purchase ... meaning, I saw the car, fell in love with it and bought it ;-).   It was not until later that I really started researching more in detail. The summary and my advices to you are the following:

Most important of all is: get the facelift model! These are models starting 2019- . Jaguar improved and specially corrected many of the flaws of the first generation (not to the say it was a bad car, but the 2nd gen is better - this I know from watching many reviews about the new XE on YouTube).  In my case, I was lucky that the car I bought was 2nd Gen.

Here are some reviews to watch:

2020s:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtoAQK6HtPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtoAQK6HtPM)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amdD0TUaCio&t=974s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amdD0TUaCio&t=974s)

This one might scare you, but it is about the older models

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6xG3qCl5A0&t=800s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6xG3qCl5A0&t=800s)

I cannot tell you much about maintenance costs, since I just got it a couple of weeks ago. However, what I can tell you is to do a regular service every year or 10-15k km, and not as recommended or at least indicated in the Jaguar online service intervals, of every 2 years or 32k km. That is too long and/or too many km!

Getting in and out of the rear seats is not very comfortable for adults. If you need this, then you are much better off with the XF - which is a familiy car. The XE is ok for children in the back, but not for regular use by adults (in my opinion).

Then, I personally do not like Diesel cars... it's like driving a farming traktor.... ;-) too noisy (of course you don't hear it when you are sitting inside, but still ...).

Also check that the rear seats are foldable. I oversaw this and mine are fixed. Not a big issue for me, but still. As an alternative I bought a roof rack for when I need to transport snowboards e.g.  About 200 ‚Ç¨ on ebay (new from the UK).

If you want to transport bicicles, check if you can attach a tow-bar to the car and get a rack for it (check ""Jaguar XE accessories"" on YouTube).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hr3FrxZwVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hr3FrxZwVA)

And finally: get a wireless adapter for Apple Carplay or Android.  The 2nd Gen comes with these features, wired however. Probably the newer models come with a wireless connection, but not the 2020. I am not sure but I believe the older models do not come with Carplay or Android.

Uff... I originally just wanted to advice you to get the 2nd Gen... which I emphasize again ;-).

Cheers - hope you'll get your Jaaag soon enough.",Jaguar

"i know that the F-Type's design was based around the E-Type but, the E-Type is from the 1960s. The people who admire and grew up around those cars probably aren't into modern cars. The F-Type came out in 2014, it's 10 years old. That inherently appeals to a younger generation.",Jaguar

"Yeah the EV charger is not coming in a while. 

At least Dodge has a continuous product lineup. Jaguar on the other hand, was a lot more confusing. Jaguar has nothing to show for F-segment, or the upper class of S-segment. Their performance department lacks presense, there's no R or SVR on most models, not to mention how overpriced their lower end cars are. 

Dodge don't have any of these problems. Every remotely sporty Dodge car has a halo model, there's no gap between essential models, so not counting the Viper Dodge's brand image is not going down. 

If Jaguar don't make it this time that's probably the end for them as a proper luxury brand.",Jaguar

"> as a mass-market transportation fuel, petrol is done. It‚Äôs going away, so electric cars are simply inevitable.

EV's only make up somewhere around 6% of cars on the roads.  Even by the most optimistic, green-minded data-crunching isn't looking to cross the 51% mark until after 2050.

At current production rates, for current prices, we have over 75 years of gasoline available (via production from oil distillation).  That 75 years will keep extending further out though, as less IC vehicles on the roads consume less gas. 

Add in more advanced means of getting oil, and higher price margins driving different, higher cost methods of getting oil, and that 75 years + gets even further pushed to the right.

In short, Gasoline for IC engines is not ""done"", and will not be for a very, very long time...

The the gold-rush race for EV $$$'s has simply spread too much propaganda into some circles of thought.",Jaguar
"Which screen do you have? If it‚Äôs the larger one with the buttons at the bottom, it can probably be updated over the air or at a dealer, which will give you Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.",Jaguar

"I say, drive it til the wheels fall off.  Most late model cars are reliable, as long as they‚Äôve been taken care of and you‚Äôre not getting a highly strung out racing machine. People do it all the time with BMW is an Audi, and those are no less to maintain than a jag.",Jaguar
"Every replacement engine has a suspicious story behind it. I advise you pay close attention to the condition of the car, the underbody, service history etc. looking for regular oil changes, maintenance and receipts etc. A thorough test drive would be a must. 

Potential major red flags aside, what is the price? If it ticks your boxes and the overall condition satisfies you, go for it.",Jaguar

"OP,  two minor aesthetic mods that you might consider are installing a chromed wire grill and chromed trunk/boot trim (the long one located on the top of the lids vertical surface).  That'd be a nice touch.

Apparently the ecu had locked off and immobilised. Unclipping it and putting it back reset it as above.

Not a stop start battery for info. When it wouldn't even turn over due to ecu it just made a humming noise and no starter activity.",Jaguar

The cylinder imbalance codes are based off a self test of ‚Äúinferred mixture strength‚Äù monitors specific cylinder fueling errors. This test is ran when vehicle is at a steady load in 6th gear between 1200-2400 rpm‚Äôs for 10 minutes. You are under boost. Depending on how much pressure your tester is it won‚Äôt pressurize the system enough. At the dealer we replace everything. The ‚Äúreusable‚Äù part is just to cut warranty costs since we always pulled the supercharger off for repairs. The fuel line used to not be reusable. The gaskets used to not be reusable. JLR got tired of eating a ton of warranty parts.,Jaguar
"The I-Pace is made under contract by Magna Steyr in Austria, they handle the¬† assembly for certain vehicles made by Mercedes and BMW as well as others. Jag just screws the¬† badge on.

"The SUV's were really just something to put on the lots with the Jaguar logo. I prefer an X-type to them. The XJ ended production 5 years ago. The only model left is the F-type and XF. Not really much is getting axed. Land Rover is the cash cow of the two brands anyway, always has been. The truth is Jaguar has never been a profitable brand, not in 40 years. They didn't make anything for Ford who saved them. Haven't done much for Tata. Dealers across North America are surrendering their franchises left and right. I think when Ian left the writing was on the wall. Their direction delivered to Tata under Ford was putting BMW in their cross hairs. BMW beat them, Jaguar didn't keep up. They didn't stay relevant. Same old story. I'm happy to see the brand still here in any form. The ageing AJV8 was a garden variety Europen V8 made at a Ford plant, nothing special.

"Honestly if you can keep any ICE car in good condition today for a long time like past 2050 then there‚Äôs a good chance it will eventually spike in value. Because you look at cars from the 1900s that were just generic daily drivers when they were produced, and now they are collector cars. Now that will be amplified when in a couplw decades it‚Äôs either exceedingly rare or impossible to buy a brand new ICE car in most places. Fuel will still be available a lot longer than newly produced ICE cars. Either way I think the collector demand will rise for any ICE car given enough time. Even car museums.

"> The iPhone is made in china. They are more than capable.

You are confusing products manufactured *in* China by a foreign company that has a very strict QC, with products made in, and by Chinese companies without any QC. *VERY* different.

Compare an iPhone with a Chinese phone. A world apart.

>As for stealing IP, sure, it‚Äôs a huge problem and lies at the heart of diplomatic tension with the US.

I'm not American, this is a *World* issue, not just US.

>But firstly, their battery technology is arguably on-par with anyone else‚Äôs, and copying only gets you so far, the Chinese are leaders in solar and it‚Äôs unlikely you can lead in something by copying.

By stealing IP/tech/etc you get to the front without spending the time, money and resources to get there. *Then* you can boost yourself into the front with ease. I'm sure a marathon runner who had been given a piggy-back for 3 quarters of the race would win too.

>I agree but it‚Äôs not really possible to avoid it really.

No-one is forcing *anyone* to buy Chinese products. It's just unfortunate that people will pick price>everything else. Ignoring the fact that cheap Chinese products flooding every market they touch, putting local and national companies out of business (the people who provide their own communities with jobs), surely quality is something worth paying a bit extra for if you can? The old adage 'buy cheap, buy twice' holds true in many industries. Speak to anyone in heavy industry about Chinese steel.

Sports, luxury, now SUVs, luxury, ev etc. Porsche and Jag are nowhere near the same, and Porsche is not abandoning the 911 lol. Aston and arguably RR (The defining british car on the market) would have to get nuked from orbit to be in any way similar.

see the below quote from newsroom 

Amongst the model lines, the 911 and Macan were the stars of 2023. For the first time since 2007, PCNA sold more than 11,000 911 models in a single year, an increase of 14.6 percent versus 2022. The Macan set a new annual record with 26,947 deliveries against a previous high of 24,716 set in 2021. Versus last year, Macan sales grew 13.8 percent. Sales of the Taycan grew by 4.1 percent to 7,570 cars, representing 10 percent of PCNA sales in 2023. In parallel, the 718 was the fastest-growing model line in 2023 with an increase of nearly 30 percent in 2023 to total 4,526 cars. The introduction of the third-generation Cayenne during the course of 2023 drove sales past 20,000 vehicles for only the second time in PCNA history.

I have to say say Ford ownership of Jaguar was very good for the company in a lot of ways. I just wish Ford owned them for a littlel longer and worked on the later XK X150 with them.

"X-Types are Mondeos in a fancy dress, a lot of people say that in a demeaning way, I personally have never found that to be the case. The Mondeo was a great base car, and the Jag is just more luxurious enough to make a difference. However, it is most certainly not **what I would call** a ""real"" Jag experience.

For me, a Jaguar has either got to be truly luxurious, in which case I would aim for an XJ - looks pretty similar in those model years to an X-Type, but it's a much more refined car.

Or, it should be a fast, sporty GT, like the XKR or the 6 or 8 cylinder F-Type.

The X-Type is front or all wheel drive, small yet isn't really sporty. It's can be a great daily driver, but there are a million alternatives. If you really like how it looks and want a relatively cheap daily, go for it. Just be aware, that you're missing out on a lot, both in terms of refinement and performance.",Jaguar

"Personally, I recommend the rear wheel drive variant of the supercharged V8 engine, aka, P450 RWD. For the V8 F-Type, that is the lightest configuration and most playful. It also happens to be the least expensive for brand-new or almost brand-new ones.

After the warranty expires, you can simply reprogram the ECU, and the P450 will become ""P600,"" just with a $1,000 ECU tune budget. From a hardware standpoint, there is no difference in supercharger units and cooling systems between the R model and P450, and the engines for those two models are identical, so P450 is certainly a better deal.",Jaguar
"Honestly firstly I'd start with the tune, all tunes are made different and tunes have different parameters to achieve a set a/f mixture for best output specific with the modifications done. If you can try to get a revised version of your tune or try a different one that matches your modifications.

Tune could be running too rich or too lean in certain driving conditions. If the smoke test is inconclusive so far I'd rule out a leak but when I do them I leave them for 30 minutes at 30psi with the exhaust blocked and ignition turned on for a common baseline if testing intake.

When removing the supercharger there is guide pins that are supposed to be used to align the supercharger and make sure the gasket is in the correct place and isn't off to either side when refitting. There could be a tiny chance of this leaking so you would have to look. You could use soapy water and spray it around different components and areas you suspect could leak even if you can't hear a leak it could still be there and bubbles will form if so. The management on these engines is very sensitive and even a leak so small could cause issues like this from experience.

Codes suggest (dependent on lean or rich parameter)

Rich

* Intake air system blockage, restricting air from entering cylinders
* Specified cylinder, localised damage/restriction of fuel rail
* Specified cylinder, localised blockage/restriction within exhaust manifold
* Fuel injector failure
* Damage/friction in valve train components
* Camshaft profile switching system failure

Lean

* Fuel injector connector is disconnected, connector pin is backed out, connector pin corrosion
* Specified cylinder, localised air leak on intake manifold to cylinder head connection
* External fuel leak at fuel injector
* Fuel restriction within fuel injector
* Specified cylinder, localised damage/restriction of fuel rail
* Air leak around spark plug
* Air leak around fuel injector
* Fuel injector failure
* Ignition coil failure

As for failure areas

* Check for air leak on intake manifold to cylinder head connection
* Check for external fuel leak at fuel injector
* Check for fuel restriction within fuel injector
* Check for damage/restriction of fuel rail
* Check for air leak around spark plug
* Check for air leak around fuel injector
* Check and install a new fuel injector as required
* Check and install a new ignition coil as required

Hope this can help",Jaguar
"I have a 2009 XJ8 with that same engine and transmission.  Actually pretty reliable.  In the 3 years I have owned it, the only engine related repairs I have had to do have been on the cooling system.  Overflow tank and thermostat both went out.  While replacing the thermostat, I also replaced a lot of coolant hoses, including the one under the intake, and the water pump, which is known to go out.

I also had the replace the upper control arms and outer tie rod ends.  I think those bits are shared with the S-Type as well.

I don‚Äôt think the S-Type shares the XJ‚Äôs air suspension setup, which is good, because it‚Äôs probably the least reliable part of the car.

The 4.2L engine fixed all the timing chain issues that plagued the 4.0.  They also ditched the rather troublesome Ford 5R55 gearbox in favor of a bulletproof ZF 6HP.

So a 4.2L S-Type should be one of Jaguar‚Äôs more reliable models.

"I think there are some bitter dealers because they know they have to give up their franchise. I don't think Jaguar will be sold off yet. However, after the all-EV attempt fails, they may have no choice but to sell the Jaguar brand name.

The sad thing is, all of this was unnecessary because if Tata had any brains and vision, they could have kept Jaguar as a dedicated sports car brand and kept the company alive even in smaller volume production with future ""G-Types"" at higher prices. Alternatively, they could have brought the three-row J-Pace, the second generation F-Pace, and one XJ flagship to supplant volume for the G-Types of the future. 

Instead, Tata's criminal negligence in management direction since 2017 left Jaguar with no new product to sell since 2017. Most people don't know this, but the F-Pace was the fastest selling Jaguar in Jaguar's history. My point here is that as late as 2017, many consumers were definitely willing to buy Jaguars even as SUVs, and bought them in droves. There is no excuse for Tata's failure here.",Jaguar

"Spark plugs, in a diesel? 

What mileage are you doing?

I‚Äôd be changing the oil every 7 to 8k, these things have possibly the worst diesel engine ever built & their party trick is to self destruct when it stretches its timing chain.

They also use plastic chain guides that can wear & leave fine plastic particles that can block the oil pickup, causing crank spin & possible turbo failure.

To replace affected parts, JLR updated the spec for the chain in 2019, is expensive, upwards of ¬£2k in the UK & I‚Äôve no clue of the cost of a replacement engine from JLR & if buying a used engine from a pre 19 car I‚Äôd advise replacing the mentioned parts before installing.

Having said that, if it does fail I‚Äôd bin the thing as electrical failures aren‚Äôt uncommon either.

*To qualify comments I was fleet manager for 40 JLR vehicles & had several destruct during our tenure.

We removed all JLR vehicles from our user/chooser list as a result.

"Just bought the 2019 F-Pace S in the US. It looks like yours. Same color & everything. I love it, but I'm immediately having some minor concerns. We had to drive several hours away to buy it. On the way back home, I stopped for gas & just after, I noticed the check engine light was on (solid, not flashing). I know that could be a result of an issue with the gas cap. I checked that it was well tightened (clicked after refilling) at our next pit-stop. I put at least 200 miles, plus on it after & the light is still on.  We also tried disconnecting the negative battery cable for at least a minute to reset the light, but it is still on. What next? Any suggestions as to how to figure out what the issue is, aside from a full diagnostic?
The second thing I've noticed is that after locking the car, the internal hazard light button stays illuminated. I've read that it could be a sign that there is a parasitic drain on the battery somewhere. Nothing is plugged in & all other lights are off,  inside & outside the wagon. I haven't noticed any issues with low  power in the vehicle even when I start it up. The thing I have noticed is pulsing running lights (not flickering, but pulsing). It's hard to explain, but I saw it by chance when I was looking at some footage on our garage  video camera. My car was running & the strip of lights just below the actual headlights was pulsing, almost like the"" chaser"" type Christmas lights. It continued even after the car was switched from park to reverse. That doesn't seem like a normal thing; however, we've never owned a vehicle with so many ""bells & whistles"" or a foreign car, so I honestly wouldn't know.

"There‚Äôs a lot of information that you‚Äôre not telling us, so giving you a ballpark is difficult. 

* model year 
* engine displacement/cylinder number 
* fuel type 
* mileage
* service history (if mentioned)

Those are some of the more important details we‚Äôre lacking here. If you‚Äôre in Europe, then likely a diesel XJ won‚Äôt be very expensive and even a half decent one won‚Äôt be terribly expensive. 

If you‚Äôre in the North American Market, looking at a supercharged V8, then $6k seems a little low. 

No matter what model year you‚Äôre looking at, you have to accept that these are $100k USD calibre machines, and they come with $100k USD calibre maintenance. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you need to be afraid of owning one ‚Äî parts are indeed expensive but if you can comfortably afford to run: 

* a luxury SUV
* a large pickup truck 
* a proper muscle car (V8 Mustang, etc)

I also believe the collectability of sports cars will be ""wider net"" than before, with more models that are collectible than previous historical precedents. For this reason, I am collecting the F-Type V8 and 992 911 manual transmission model and will keep them for 20+ years.

Beautiful car! Currently doing the timing chains on my XF 5.0 Supercharged. Finally got the new parts in now just slowly putting it back together.,Jaguar
"It sounds like you haven't done any basic checks. You have an oil leak. It can't be leaking onto the chain given that it's inside the engine and will have oil on it.

If you have an oil leak you must check the oil level every time you drive. This is a simple procedure. The oil must be warm (10mins idle or drive), the engine must be off with the ignition on (press start without foot on brake), the car must be on a flat surface and now you can cycle through the digital screen with the button on the indicator stalk. Eventually you should see the oil level. Personally I check it every day, half an hour or so after a drive is normally ideal.

You must mean oil is leaking onto the auxiliary belt, my 5.0 N/A XK currently is at the garage for a similar leak. In my case it is the front crank seal. This is an expensive repair. But an oil leak anywhere on the engine (especially the front) is likely to get onto the auxiliary belt. Once it does oil will be thrown everywhere making locating the leak difficult. 

You really shouldn't drive the car with a leak like this. I learned this the hard way, my alternator died due to oil ingress. Even though the leak was small, I recommend fixing it immediately.

Lastly you shouldn't be surprised that old Jags are unreliable. It's very rare the car is the problem, it's the cheap previous owners that neglect issues then act all surprised when something catastrophic happens. In your case you may have internal engine damage.",Jaguar

The 2.2 won't set the world on fire but I can't criticise it, and broadly speaking it has been very mechanically reliable.

I have one more point to look for which specifically relates to the sportbrake: The tailgate does not always hold its position and will drop out of alignment.

"The good news is that the rust all happens in quite predictable locations. Check around the windscreen and rear screen for bubbles. Check the arches and front wings too, it‚Äôll be fairly obvious. Also, bear in mind the drains, there‚Äôs one in the petrol filler, and one on each side that drains into the wheel well from the windscreen. If they block, or get pushed inside the wing, they‚Äôll rust it out.

The sills are the main problem. They rust out and it‚Äôs probably a grand to fix it, unless you‚Äôre handy with a welding kit. 

The later cars don‚Äôt have nikasil linings or problems with the tensioners. You might find oil leaks and maybe coolant leaks. The thermostat housing is often plastic and easy to over-torque and break - can an aluminium one.

The engine is pretty reliable in the V8, the head doesn‚Äôt tend to go as a rule. Obviously not a universal truth.

"I would disagree. I had a 2003 XKR and the 2007 XK is far superior in every measurable way. Maybe you like the sound or styling more on the X100, but the X150 is just better engineered and much more reliable and easy to live with.",Jaguar
"Absurd pov. I love my P300. 295 lb-ft torque from 1500 rpm is plenty in the real world. And the 4-pot is the best-handling, most sportscar-like F-Type because it's tuned for its lighter nose.",Jaguar
"I would recommend going for the 22MY over the 19MY or 20MY.  The 22MY got slightly more range and Pivi Pro infotainment system which is way better than NGI. 

I have a 24MY with 22‚Äù wheels.  Honestly, jt takes a little extra planning and time for road trips. But I enjoy geeking out on the planning. Recently I took a 450 mile round trip in one day.  I stopped 4 times.  Twice on the way out and twice on the way back.  I could have stretched and done it 1 stop each way but I drive fast on the highway and I don‚Äôt like to stop for more than 30 minutes.",Jaguar
Very cool!,Jaguar
"As someone with a 2002 XJ, I wish it had more Ford parts, it would probably be a lot easier to keep it on the road.",Jaguar
There is a china Tesla style screen infotainment you can get. It tries to look OEM but I have not seen it  in person. Supposed to be plug n play.,Jaguar
"I agree, definitely a future classic.",Jaguar
"If you go to the dashboard menu (if you press the volume button on the steering wheel) there is an option in there somewhere for sure, I have done this before on my XE",Jaguar
"I should clarify. The valved exhaust control is for efficiency. You might see only one side in use more than the other, but both are active when you‚Äôre driving more aggressively/spiritedly lol",Jaguar

"With jags, when they‚Äôre good, they‚Äôre very, very good. But some of those Friday afternoon jobs are absolutely shocking. I dropped on with my XF and never had an issue. I know there are many others who aren‚Äôt so fortunate.",Jaguar
anmy aftermarkets that might be comp?,Jaguar
It wasnt.,Jaguar
"In the process of buying a new Jag now, talks at the dealer felt very much like when I bought my Saab.",Jaguar
"I hear you - never too young to fall in love with a Jaaaaag :) Good luck! Feel free to reach out. Many great contributers here and in specialized FB groups, can be helpful for potential buyers. I researched Jag and XKs for over a year before I made my purchase. Test driving cars is really fun too.",Jaguar
Thank you ppp,Jaguar
"That's unlucky, I have a MY 2015 XF 2.0D, 75k miles with no issues outside of service parts like brake rotors. It got over 50 mpg average over the last 10k miles and very comfortable. Maybe I have just been lucky in this.",Jaguar

"Ruined. At least keep part of the lineup ICE.

Tata, in my opinion ruined Jaguar and Land Rover. But I am just an old fart.",Jaguar
"Depends on model.


I have a black and 3L portfolio XF but it's also got black alloys - I think those were optional extra.


That black does not look like it has my sport grille which makes me assume as a 2.2 it's a premium luxury but not an S model with sports seats?",Jaguar
"Mea culpa, my friend. Mea culpa.",Jaguar
middle east isn't very good for that kind of thing unless you drive a land cruiser and then theres a specialist on every corner,Jaguar
In what world is it not common or expensive ü§£,Jaguar
Thank you! I looked at it like dude that‚Äôs a Mazda. Then saw JAAAAGGG. Thought I was nuts,Jaguar
"Thanks! Yeah that option freaks me out a little but on inspection they are in great condition and seem to have been babied. It‚Äôs amazing how little they wear when they‚Äôre not hammered on the track. Oh yeah and they perform amazingly as you‚Äôd expect. Congrats, what year? Took me like 4 months to find mine.",Jaguar
Thnx,Jaguar
"Sweet! I‚Äôve got the 01 xk8 convertible, same interior just tan leather instead of blacküëå",Jaguar
