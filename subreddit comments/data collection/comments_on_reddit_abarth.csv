"I spoke with Abarth Spain & Germany. Both told me to be very cautious and only use 10W50.

Dealers often recommend certain stuff in their own interest, but sometimes there‚Äôs a reason. 

Thx for posting. 1 more point for  (use what‚Äôs recommended by Abarth)",abarth
The smaller the car the bigger the dick. üòè,abarth
"I've been looking at this too, it seems the kits that need the scuttle cut are prone to the whistle.

I was looking at the RAMAir or the Airtec style to avoid that.

Be good to see the responses here",abarth
Mine is Celeste blue as well.,abarth
Katskinz is a really nice recover. Not just fabric over he old seats.,abarth
I drove that car on Saturday. It drove nice for sure but too much money. Sounds like the inspection went well. It ll need new tires.  Enjoy.,abarth
"Abarth has a sport pedigree, amazing successes in rallying. Now part of junior formula series etc.
Yes it's a small car but that's the point, have you seen first Porsche 911? Small call, front section basically looks like a frog. Abarth is passion, it's style and speed, it's fun! Every time I go for a drive or just coffee run it gives me so much joy. No one can insult that.",abarth
"How do tou achieve this stance, camber, wheels and tires? Thanks!",abarth
Let us know what you fig out was the issue,abarth

"Making me jealous! We got rid of ours when we had kid no.3 as it's only a 4 seater. The Competizione was soooo much fun to commute with! It was 20 miles of smiles each day!


Never got mine remapped. We'll be getting another again in a few years so I'll be looking to getting it remapped though.¬†",abarth
"Yeah I love my little car but they tend to fall apart all at the same time, now it started going into limp mode, I can't hit the gas pedal a little bit because it goes limp, I'm getting from the forums other people that have same issues and they say that injectors go bad but ill try ti figure it out this weekend,  also DONT do the evap ""fix"", I did it and you can't ever get the check engine to turn off after that, big mistake.",abarth
"It does yes, to 14",abarth
"260? What mods are on in it?

I currently posses the supersport variant doing 180. Looking to up the power. An basic chip brings me to 200.",abarth
Can‚Äôt edit post but the abarth is something I‚Äôve wanted for years is it even worth the trade my bikes worth about 1500 2k summer time,abarth
"I‚Äôm almost positive this has to do with the missing abs sensor. You cars tcm only knows what the wheel speed on 3 of the 4 corners is. When you are accelerating, the car is trying to brake the right front because it thinks that that corner is ‚Äúslipping‚Äù. Our cars also brake the front brakes independently in cornering to increase turn in and stability. 

Fix your car properly and this will go away.",abarth
"Could be as simple as needing an alignment done, one good pothole hit is enough to throw the steering out of alignment",abarth

"2019, but 500L and 124 had their last year in NA in 2020.  2023 was last model year for 500X.",abarth
"The auto is awesome, fuck the haters.   It has more gears, can manually select gears, holds gears well in corners and just behaves really well.   As an adult who also has a city commute to and from work, it's awesome to just relax in traffic when you don't need to drive like a maniac.   It's still a more fun car than literally any of my friends have.

The auto isn't just a good choice, IMO it's the BETTER choice.    üë∫",abarth
"‚ÄúIs that a fucking smart car?!‚Äù Is very funny.  But honestly I‚Äôm surprised that Europeans get made fun of. Because pretty much all the cars  are small displacement hatchbacks no? Here in the states, especially the Midwest its easy pickins for us.",abarth
I haven‚Äôt since the oil change at 71k. Not a bad idea to check it out though,abarth
"Wait, what? The US Abarth has a high interference? God, no. I was told it didn't...",abarth
"Water in the coolant tank should be mixed with antifreeze and have a sweet smell, so you should be able to recognize it",abarth

"I think the battery is your problem, try swapping it with a new one. If you have the receipt you should even get your money back for the old one.",abarth
"I won‚Äôt suggest it for deliveries as:
- suspensions are stiff
- turning radius is sacrificed if car has a lowering kit 
- rear boot is oddly shaped and tapers going up
- if already lowered, you risk scraping under the front bumper on steep inclines / high speed bumps 

 ‚Ä¶but damn it sounds glorious",abarth
"The shifter mechanism on the gearbox side is the same design as the Alfa 147/156/GT/GTV which has the exact same issue.  I fixed the issue on my Alfa GT with this:

My Abarth now has the same issue so i am going to buy some of these again and see if they fix it.",abarth
"The tuner is very famous in Cyprus. He only does alfa romeo, fiat cars. The essese produces 160bhp stock with ihi turbo. So with remap it goes 180 max. The thing is that with ihi you cannot see more than 185 bhp...... So if i want to go more i will need td04 or garrett.",abarth
Revised display too. Never liked the pre 2015 speedo,abarth
Agreed,abarth
"At any given moment you can learn some part in your car was the one in a batch of 20,000 that quality control didn't catch

Hope for the best, expect the worst as the saying goes. Solid chance you're fine but there's no reason something can't go fucky, just be prepared for it. Even cars with 2,500 miles on them have issues sometimes, just the way of things",abarth

"Where I live your unable to use your phone or even touch your phone while driving unless it's physically mounted to the car dash or mirror etc. 

A head unit with android auto or apple car play is really useful as basically you can do all that your phone did without touching it. 

Looks cleaner imho if it's just a nice screen incorporated into the dash than a tablet or phone.",abarth
"Yes. Remove the plastic close to the handbrake. There is the inertial central ecu from Bosch there. Cet the black wire and run a switch to the dash.

That's a hack to remove esp, ttc and tc.",abarth
Valve and piston had a little party in the cylinder. Reddit won't let me attach a photo but it didn't end well,abarth
Wow I'm starting to think this was done on purpose from the dealership...they were trying really hard to screw me over and I contacted the state attorney general and I had a feeling they just unbolted stuff lol,abarth
"I‚Äôm not familiar with Fiat cars but this screen and operating system looks identical to a Mazda‚Äôs, do they share parts?",abarth
Interesting. How did you turn it on via the OBD port? I‚Äôve never done something like it before,abarth
"I'll do that, thank you. I took the knuckle to a small shop that was recommended to me to get the new hub and bearing pressed in. I've never had any work done at this shop before so given how my first experience went I'll look for another shop :/

Oh well, I'll try to get it done as soon as I can afford to do so, thank for the help",abarth
"I suspect the an air intake sensor. Had such a problem once. Hard cold start and could past 2500 rpm. With the check engine light on.

Ofcourse confirm my thought with an scanner.",abarth
"About 90k miles. The valves and cylinders kissed, and based on what the shop is saying I think it may be more than just the head. But I will look into it!",abarth
Lets see the interior,abarth
What usually gets it going again? Sounds possibly like a fuel pump iasue,abarth
"I don't have experience with Abarth valves specifically, but generally valves only stick for two reasons:

1.  They're bend and binding in the guide.  Common with piston-valve contact like failed timing belts.
2. The engine has sat for a LONG time.  Usually tapping the valve stem with a hammer is enough to get them free, but whatever stuck them (rust, solidified oil, etc) may not clear out without disassembly.",abarth
I‚Äôd put money on burnt exhaust valve.,abarth
"Check the fuse, if that's good check the relay. That would be where I'd start.",abarth
"9,0 Nice Abarth Bro üòé",abarth
Also there ist some pipe/hose (bent intercooler pipe?) blocked by yellow bondo!? Bottom section of the pictures...,abarth
"Trying to buy wheels aint no treat either. Everybody has something listed in 4x98 lug pattern. Who knows if its actually in stock. I actually went to a shop that said they had 4 of the wheels I wanted in stock. I was gonna order online, but I realized it was local. He looked them up. They dont actually have them. TSW just has them listed as being somewhere in their system.",abarth
Nope miles reflects the body . Only time you change that is replacement of the cluster and it has to match the old cluster.,abarth
I‚Äôm also new to the 124 Abarth game in Charlotte! Looking for a shop myself.,abarth
"My thought is that with all those mods is hard to tell if its normal

My multiair when consumes a little bit of oil start sounding like mini farts",abarth
"My intake keeps rubbing on one of the hose clamps below it and tearing a hole, need to move mine over like this",abarth
"Looks amazing!
Also the tail lights change to those of the newer generation (post-lift?) was a good move! These look so much better!

The old back lights and the steering wheel of the <2016 Abarths are the only things that aesthetically do not work for me.",abarth
"For EU owners, check out https://store.blackparts.it/ for aftermarket stuff.",abarth
What are impact structures? And why wouldn't they fit? What could I snap a picture of that'll tell me? Thanks btw,abarth
595 Competizione wheels only sold in Europe/Asia etc,abarth
Decals lmao. I‚Äôm so dumb. This UK time.  Would love to see the interior of it.,abarth
"No, they should not make whistling sounds. The pad runners/hardware could potentially do with some lubrication. This is commonly done at install time with anti-seize copper grease.

As for the rumbling, do you have slotted discs? They can produce more noise. We have slotted on our car and can confirm under hard breaking they can produce a quiet but deep ""rumble"". As long as you have no issues with the brakes pulling or vibration through steering I wouldn't worry too much.",abarth
Probably swaybar bushings,abarth
there's a big difference between keeping heat in the turbo and overheating the turbo.,abarth
How did you replqce them? Did you went to a shop or did it by yourself?,abarth
"A larger rotor has more surface area which results in greater mechanical advantage. The higher level of advantage, the faster the breaks will lock up. Why do you think Nascar & formula one use multi piston calipers & not single piston? Of course tire compound matters, but so does the weight of the vehicle.",abarth
This is the devil edition Abarth (see the last digits of the odometer and red accents). The owner needs to sell his soul in exchange for high mileage. Stay away.,abarth
Decent winters on steelies are very affordable.,abarth
I like it!,abarth
I needed some there and then and they had nothing else. Sales chap read on another abarth forum that 5W40 would be an alright alternative,abarth
I had a 13 in black with the red accents a while back and loved it. I think this color is quickly winning me over though haha.,abarth

I Uber eats with mine part time during dinner hours. 2015 auto. I make like 500 to 700 weekly. So far no problems but I will need new tires soon. The income from last year paid more than the car purchase price.,abarth

"Tried to fit a 45inch TV in a euro 500 Abarth, won‚Äôt fit laying flat because of front seats üòÇ the car is too short",abarth
"Likely not: there are multiple Uconnect 7‚Äù radios, some have GPS (compass), Nav, and/or CarPlay.  Hardware itself is missing if it doesn‚Äôt already have it.  The label on top of the radio will say what capabilities it has.

So what you could do is find a unit with CarPlay, install that, and do a Proxi alignment.  That‚Äôs what I did for my US market 2017, which never offered CarPlay.  Bought a Euro radio, and then messed with the proxi until it was mostly happy.

You could also go the aftermarket route, which will also likely be much cheaper‚Ä¶  I think the radio I bought was $350.",abarth
That window thing is probably the stupid clip. Easy 20-minute fix,abarth

"With an open downpipe you will get increased performance and decreased gas consumptioneven with the stock exhaust.

By ""blow-off"" you mean the pop-off valve that releases turbo air? I have that, too. Very nice, and increases both performance and durability of the turbine.",abarth

It rides totally fine for me, although I'm used to stiff on other cars as well so I'm biased.",abarth

For what it‚Äôs worth check your coolant level & that it‚Äôs circulating properly.,abarth
"So I purchased a 68 plate comp. CarPlay did it work, so I took the dash off, checked the label I. The head unit which confirmed it had CarPlay.

Than it was a case of turning it on via the OBD port. 

So my advice is see if you can confirm the headunit supports it before you decide what to do.",abarth
"Was du machen kannst vor dem Kauf ist die Kompression des Motors kurz pr√ºfen zu lassen und einen Abgastest machen wie die Werte aussehen.... wenn Kompression und Lambdawerte stimmen, hast du schon mal eine grobe Indikation wie es um den Motor steht. La Deutsche Vita w√§re dann noch mit Kamera rein und Kolben/Ventile anschauen ;-)

Ausserdem w√ºrde ich nach √ñlverbrauch fragen (klar das ist dann einfach eine Ausage, pi mal Daumen des Verk√§ufers...), aber trotzdem. Wenn er dann √ñl s√§uft wie bl√∂d, hast du evtl. etwas in der Hand...

Nach dem Kauf dann immer sch√∂n 1x pro Jahr oder alle 10k KM √ñl wechseln inkl. Filter. Kerzen wechseln (NGK 93311), wenn du Lust hast Getriebe√∂l (Selenia Tutela 75w-85 bei Handschalter) und K√ºhlmittel wechseln.

"I have a yaris as my back up,back up car it always starts and its amazing what can fit in the back. Its a two door hatch problem free and low maintenance.",abarth
Its not a brand that anyone gives a crap about here in the US. Stelantis screwed this up anyway. Didn't need a whole new platform. Batteries up front. Electric motor in the back. Done. Could have even used two small motors.,abarth
"I'd actually be interested in hearing it. Even stock they're relatively loud cars, I don't think I have ever heard a quiet one, lol",abarth

"Overall it's a decent unit but definitely has some quality control issues. When it works right, it's fantastic. That being said though, I am on my second head unit and third wiring harness trying to get all the quirks sorted out.

My first head unit was fault, and would produce a constant hum as though it wasn't bypassing the amp in the unit. With that second unit however, the harness has some odd short in it so it doesn't always turn off with the car and steering wheel controls cut out like once a week. Their support with them has been fantastic however, but you can tell it's a generic Chinese unit.

Like I said, when it works, it works great. Sound is just fine, having Android Auto and Carplay wireless is fantastic, and it looks great in the dash. And let's be honest, these cars interiors have more problems than a head unit that acts up once in a while!",abarth
"There is some guy in the UK who 3d prints attachments to connect those vents directly to the car, so no air just gets thrown around inside the console",abarth

"Word of warning, I loved mine until they welded themselves to the valve stems and had to be Dremel'd off carefully. Might not hurt to put a tiny amount of anti-seize on the threads!",abarth
"hi I also go through this along with other drivers...if there's no problems found just remember the following.. 

there's a canister inside your gas tank and when you go below 70% full it can trigger the code...so say u need to pass inspection... 

reset the cel... then keep filling your gas tank every time you hit like 50-60 miles..never keep filling past auto stop either.

once the DOT monitors go back to ""ready"" status (takes about 200 miles of driving like you said) then you can get your inspection done and remember keep that tank filled every 60 miles... after you pass inspection don't even worry about it and it may come back if your tank goes lower but you can just do it again in a year lol..

reset, keep tank filled every 60 miles, when status is ready on all monitors get the inspection (making sure the tank is still above 75% filled) and once you pass just do it again the next year..

But yea thats if there's no actual leaks or problems... this is what it is if that's the case... good luck.",abarth
"In my country (European models) I have read several complaints about the automatic gearbox of Fiat 500, and most ""experts"" tend to stay away from it. Probably not without reason. 

I have a manual, and daily commute is not really a hassle. 

I would not buy an Abarth with automatic gearbox anyway, because that takes part of the fun away. And this car is mostly about fun.",abarth

"Honestly, I think the car had some other issue that they weren't fixing correctly. I think it was either an oiling or PCV problem, and that was causing oil consumption. Then, it would run low and eat parts. It's all a guess, but I would bet that my issues were more a failing of the techs than the car itself. Being a tech myself, I don't say this lightly.

I've learned that techs hate working on these cars, and for good reason. The packaging is impossible. They use every type of hardware available. And the plastic bits are as fragile as a tween's emotional state.",abarth

"I have a meticulously maintained Abarth that burnt an exhaust valve at 67k miles.  Car ran perfect right up until the moment the valve failed.  There's examples of Abarths that have done 200k+.

"So I have a N/A abarth (160hp), and I ran a race cat for a little bit and it certainly made it louder and you could hear the turbo better, but as for power I guess I can't say, maybe a little bit but I'm assuming it will need a tune to see any real gains... also be aware even with a ported o2 spacer I was never able to stop it throwing a cel completely, maybe every 300 miles so just be aware that without some ecu work that will probably be the case.",abarth

"The decat free downpipe makes the engine breath better, and it is certainly an improvement for its reliability, efficiency, and long-term lifetime. In the context of a Stage 2 upgrade, the car will go faster and burn 30% less gas. So counterintuitively, in most contexts it will pollute less. That said, before the MOT I would suggest reinstalling a cat or adding 10% isopropanol to the tank, or, even better, finding an expert mechanic to prepare your car for it.",abarth

"Those graphs do not show the Orra Fenderwell vs the ATM Fenderwell. In fact, those graphs only show data of OEM vs In engine bay vs Cowl. They don't even show data for their own fenderwell intake, though that is not my point. 

I was comparing both fenderwell intakes to each other. The ORRA and ATM intakes are equal products. If you reread my comment I am clearly saying that Orra is not better than ATM and ATM is not better than Orra, but they (BOTH of them) are the best out there. I singled them both out as being the best in terms of performance over others on the market.",abarth
Not sure if it's the same on European models but check the ground wire to your ECU. I was getting hill start assist and a bunch of other problems but once I put a $.05 washer in there everything is gone.,abarth

"I have had a 22 and now a 23 wrx. I‚Äôve also had and very, very much regret getting rid of my 2017 Abarth. Hands down, funner to drive than the Subaru. It‚Äôs a different feel. The noise the Abarth makes and the light weight combined with decent power is just a blast to drive. You don‚Äôt need much more to make the Abarth fun. An intake wakes up the turbo noises and adds to the noise/joy. I was the original owner of mine and sold it in 22‚Äô. I had zero issues with it. Nothing but oil changes and basic maintenance.",abarth
"They‚Äôre from fitment industries, Vors SP1 16x8 +20mm White 4x98. Stretched 205/45/16 tires on there to fit under the fender",abarth
"1) you need a new map straight away. You get 250hp so I think you are going to get a TD-04 turbine. That won't work with the old map.

2) I have an open downpipe but the rest is similar to your setup. As an exhaust you need a valve-controlled one, at the very least, so you can keep it quiet in the city, and open it when you want some sound. I suggest a wireless-controlled-valve exhaust for that.

3) with 250hp you need better suspensions, tyres and brakes. I have the Bilstein B14 and the Brembo 330mm for that. The car is considerably more powerful and you need better control.

PS the 200 cell is not really effective I think, because the new map and cooling of your Stage 3 doesn't put it at high temperatures. But that's a personal opinion.",abarth
You got this.  Easy on the clutch release.,abarth

A popular mod in Europe is to exchange the rear rubber buffer to a shorter one from the Fiat Coup√© (FIAT: 7782710) which allows for more suspension travel in lowered cars - but of course only after you are sure that shocks/springs are eligible and safe to use for your car!,abarth

"This is the inside of the cylinder head. Basically the below your engine cover and above the cylinders.

The black soot is carbon deposit, which is somewhat normal, but becomes problematic when it builds up so much. You can see it particularly bad on the lower set of valves (In the picture). Valves need to seal very well an carbon deposits will degrage their surface.

I'm not a true believer of the ""Italian tune up"", but it's certainly good to drive the car outside of town every now at then at higher RPMs. The concept is higher temperatures should (At least partially) remove carbon deposits.",abarth

I've been pushed out of the left lane on the highway *by cops* because of only doing 19mph over the limit (at 20 they can confiscate your car lolno not worth the risk).

Oh okay. Well it's been doing it super intermittently for 50k miles without issue so I actually just bought it 4 new mopar ignition coils bc the ones currently on the car are either old or aftermarket and I feel like it just needs to be perfect and OEM.

My car also gets a weekly beating and recline at least 5 times a day just to keep it clean it's been running so smooth when it's warm.,abarth

"There more than 40+ special or limited edition in Europe that's complicated to give you a precise answer. Also some got the turbo but not the brakes or the LSD (such as 595 turismo) .   


I don't know about NA market but for the T-Jet, let's start by the begining : 

  
**1. Turbo**

Everything below 160hp have a IHI turbo that can be tuned for 175\~195 hp. The only exception to my knowledge is the 500 essesse kit that comes with a IHI and is tuned from abarth to 160.   
Others 160+ have a Garett 1446 that can be tuned to 200\~220\~ 330nm

The way to differenciate them is to look on the heat protector on the engine bay. The heat protector. for the IHI look [like this](https://live.staticflickr.com/7262/7639006788_dfd429d4cb_b.jpg), it's way priettier than the [Garett one](https://i.imgur.com/V8BWRoL.png) which is a piece of metal folded and cutted like s\*\*\*. 

**2. Brakes**

\- On any base-package such as 500 and 595 Turismo, Pista, Maserati you get the [1 piston caliper](https://i.imgur.com/GmMS4mH.png). They are made by various company such as TRW and the aspect is very raw. 

\- On every 695 and 595 competizion or even the various biposto you get the [4 piston brembo caliper](https://www.brembo.com/en/PublishingImages/company/storia/abarth_695_Brembo.jpg). Some cars get 1 piece disk, some cars get the 2 parts floating disk with aliminium center. 

**3. LSD**

Base model got only the TTC (Torque Traction Control) which is a system that will brake during driving to get a bit of stability.   
In addition to the TTC, Competizion with the ¬´‚ÄØPerf‚ÄØ¬ª package got a LSD and probably some (all?) 695. Also one of the gearbox universal joint (gimbal in English?) is different.

**4. Suspension**

There a tons of package, and variations : OEM, Eibach, Koni‚Ä¶   


**5. Gearbox**

All the 595 and 695 got the same C510 gearbox even for MTA (automatic robotized) except of : 595 biposto with Dogring H pattern option, 595 that got a M32 (grand punto) 6 speed manual, Biposto rally and R3t with sadev 6 speed sequential. 

Despite that, the C510 have 2 design which apparently that changed over years to get a more sturdy design at the end.",abarth

"I took it back instantly and they said they completely reinstalled a new clutch and the mechanic said ""hopefully its not the transmission"" as if they now want to change the transmission. Thats why im kind of confused if its even the release bearing making the noise, but i was almost 99% sure that this was the problem. Because if it wasnt the release bearing or something else in the clutch, the noise wouldnt go away depending on the clutch engaging or disengaging (to my knowledge, im not a mechanic).",abarth

"From my understanding it‚Äôs a big upgrade from the stock exhaust in the Abarth for the EU spec. It brings it closer to the US spec (which has no muffler), but definitely has its own character. Phone cameras and the like really suck for picking up exhaust sound so it‚Äôs hard to tell, but at the very least the US spec sounds way better than the Euro spec for the standard exhaust in my opinion. I also lean towards the US setup over the upgrades, but haven‚Äôt heard one of them in person as they come from the factory. 

Personally I‚Äôm a huge fan of the exhaust on our US abarths, most of the changes I see people make are a pops & bangs tune or Cat delete. The popping is obnoxious imo and the cat delete is a little too loud for my taste (and illegal in my state.)",abarth

I picked up a 2013 with 16k miles in 2015 for $16k. In recent years, I took advantage of the used car market and sold off a car that I had for 3 years/30k miles (purchased new) for more than what I paid for and picked up a depreciated 2015 Abarth for 12k with 17k miles.",abarth

"I have a 2018 500 Abarth that is similar. I do have a cold air intake and an aftermarket wastegate, but no real performance mods. It‚Äôs an automatic, I‚Äôve installed a resonator, and I‚Äôve put sound deadening on the floor under the rear seats and the hatch area, about 10 sq.ft.

All told, it is now a nearly perfect daily driver. Plenty of power, good suspension, not too loud for my neighbors, quiet in the cabin when driving, and gets great mileage. The automatic is also great and always seems to find the right gear around town.

People can hate if they want, but I love driving mine!",abarth

As you said, other vehicles are superior in every numerical metric: Golf GTI, Fiesta ST, Veloster Turbo, etc.

"I had this same problem with my old celica... not sure if it's the same with my Abarth since I haven't had it long.

Awesome! Ever considered throwing some white Abarth stock stickers on the side? My favorite color combination :),abarth
I had a similar problem with missing pixels that I attributed to washing with too high water pressure that I think made its way in through the bottom of the windshield air vent intake area.  A few hours of sitting in the hot sun during 50 mph wind and under 10% humidity got it back to normal.,abarth

"Check the cable and bracket on the transmission. The cable attaches to a lever that pushes down on the transmission selector rod. But, the two sides of the crank have a steel bolt that runs through a bracket that becomes corroded and difficult to move. You can remove the bracket and lever and clean them up, you can also buy a new assembly. The bad news is that you will have to remove the battery and ECM to access them. Also, check the plastic clips that hold the cowl panel on. The water that corrodes the shift mechanism typically comes off the windshield. Good Luck!",abarth

"Well I can't really speak on US cars too much but I'm pretty sure they won't be any worse reliability wise, you're more likely to have issues finding parts I'd imagine.

As for European cars they're mechanically reliable. Keep it serviced regularly and you're probably not going to be having any major issues.

- when braking is the car stable? Does it pull to the left or right? If it does have it checked immediately as it‚Äôs very dangerous.
- rotor condition

As far as rumbling noise, if you have slotted and drilled rotors it‚Äôs absolutely normal. If not, get them checked as they should not be doing that.

"Stellantis needs to be punched in the face with the huge flops that these Abarth 500e and 600e will be. Ugly, low range, betraying the user base of Abarth.

If you mean the installation looks temporary then surely that‚Äôs a good thing in your situation. You order a set, fit them outside your house in 30 minutes then go drive down the road where your car bottoms out.

I love whenever I hear ‚Äúit can‚Äôt be this because it‚Äôs brand new‚Äù. It absolutely can still be a battery. Happens all the time. It can also be other things. A bad door latch is also common not letting the system shut down or any number of other parasitic draws. Get the battery tested or just swap it under warranty as your first move.,abarth
"Crazy thought.

What if the springs were installed upside-down?

Not really sure about that. They look symmetrical, but you might want to read the instructions if you can find them online. It's possible the bump stops needed to be trimmed down to compensate for the shorter springs.",abarth

"Electronic engineer there, I had the same problem and ended up swapping it. 

There are people online telling you that the LCD it's bad, it's not.

There is a memory that saves the settings of the car,  this memory saves the orientation of the LCD, in some other fiat models the LCD it's oriented in a different direction. 

My theoory is that this memory goes bad and the cpu inside the things doesn't know which way is up.",abarth

It ghosts steers sometimes, pulls left at high speeds and right at lower speeds, rattles alot but is quiet as a mouse turning right a bit, bumper is falling off, side skirts too. I only had it for a month then the engine blew and they took 9 months to repair it and I still had to pay. They told me they paid most of my bill out of the Service advisors wallet.

Open exhaust is illegal in Italy (outside racing tracks),abarth
"My understanding is the North American 500 Abarths are Multiair and spec 5w40, the European ones are T-Jet and spec 10w50.

That explains why people are claiming different oil weights to be correct. 
Since the bottom ends are, I believe, the same and only the head is different, I think you're probably okay having had 5w40 for a while in your car but should probably switch to the correct weight, if only for peace of mind. 

In a turbocharged application the valve train doesn't really get any more stress than normal but the bottom end bearings certainly do. The T-Jet valve train isn't anything exotic so I think the 50 weight oil is more for the bottom end. This suggests that the 40 weight specified for the Multiair engines is probably a compromise to keep the fancy valve train happy.",abarth

"DIY is going to be your only option to get the job done for under $3k. Parts (clutch, pressure plate, flywheel, throwout bearing/slave cylinder and new flywheel bolts) alone will be close to $1600 for OEM, closer to $2k for upgraded if you were to buy them yourself, every shop is going to charge more so they make money on parts as well. Labor time is 8 hours according to book time, so depending on shop rates you are looking at another $1k at least + shop supplies. 

It is not a super easy job for DIY but it is possible without a lift and with basic hand tools (high torque impact wrenches make everything easier). Took me an entire day to get the trans out the first time as I didn't know what all had to come out exactly. Install of parts was only a couple hours. Reinstallation was the tricky part without a transmission jack to lift the trans back up. Probably took me a total of 20 hours the first time. 

I would recommend dedicating 4 days (2 weekends as you will get burned out working on this project 4 days in a row) depending on your mechanical skill. Can be done in a single day with multiple people that are mechanically inclined. 

Order all the parts ahead of time, so you are not waiting for things to arrive. I had ordered my cluch/pressure plate/flywheel 2 months before I had to take mine apart and still had to wait 2 weeks with the car in pieces for parts to arrive.",abarth

What data? Take a note of the mileage and flash it back,abarth
We almost got it. It was federalized but likely the reason it didn't come is cali noise regulation. It's harder to pass manual cars in cali due to exhaust sound regulation testing methods. Easier to pass in auto. If it had Alfas would have sold much better here. Many many ppl lost interest when it was cancelled and I believe it was one of Alfa Romeo underestimating the demand was one of biggest mistakes of the company and rn vw and bmw axing them is a huge mistake based on this year's sales data.,abarth

But then, it's not infrequently you will see posts here about  burnt valves and other major failures, often occurring out of the blue on well running engines.",abarth
"Drive in sport mode. Regular mode will seem sluggish. Make sure both windows roll up and down (regulators are a weak point). Pay attention to drive-line clunk when shifting while moving slowly...the lower motor/torque mounts commonly go out before 50K. Listen closely for any humming from the wheels...wheel bearings are also a weak point. Check for mods. I personally would stay away from a car that's been modded...unless the mod is one you plan on doing anyway. Check the inner axle boots to make sure they aren't cracked, broken, or otherwise spraying out their grease.  the CV Axles next to the wheels don't usually go, but the inner boots between the drive shafts and the transmission are super common failure points. As far as major services...this car (the American one, anyway) doesn't have a lot of maintenance items to see to.   I think the lack of maintenance items is a direct result of this being an economy car that's been souped up rather than an entry level sports car or luxury sports car--like a Mini by BMW.

as someone that's owend a plethora of fiat vehicles use original or oem replacements every 5 years or 70k kmts I think that's arround 35ish thousand miles.  fiats all of them are sensible with timing and cooling. also change the rad at 70k miles. and clutch every 45k miles or so. depending of the fiat I have an abarth 500c mta and will change clutch at 60kmiles,abarth

"u/PeetTreedish, I mean no offense here, but everything you are saying is incorrect, and it literally does the opposite of what you're saying that it does. [Here's a link to a test](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/car-accessories/videos/a29999/how-much-a-turbo-blanket-helps/).

Here are some facts:

* The hot side of the turbo is supposed to be hot. The hotter it is, in fact, the better (until the point where things start to melt). Hotter temps contribute to higher exhaust gas velocities which spin the turbine up more quickly, which is a good thing.
* When you insulate the hot side of the turbo, you keep heat **away** from the cold side (aka the intake side aka the compressor side). You want that side as cold as possible to keep intake air temps (IATs) lower, because colder air is denser air, which means more oxygen entering the intake which improves combustion (and allows you to tune more aggressively).
* Turbo blankets **lower** intake air temps (IATs). Also, marginal increases in IATs wouldn't contribute to overheating an engine with any significance, even if they did increase IATs, which they don't. 
* These turbos have oil lines & cooling lines. The cooling lines are perfectly capable of handling the hot side of the turbo being hotter from having a turbo blanket on.
* Turbo blankets **reduce the ambient engine bay temperatures**, which extends the life of other components in the engine bay. Wires, clips, connectors, electric motors, etc. don't particularly appreciate being exposed to 800\* temperature directly next to a turbo or exhaust pipe, which is why heat shielding is used in engine bays. A turbo blanket is just a heat shield for the hottest thing: the turbine side of the turbo.

I think u/PeetTreedish has a misunderstanding of how the turbine side vs. compressor side of a turbocharger works. I can see how the mistake is made and how his logic *could* make sense on the surface, but a clearer understanding of how turbos work, plus real world testing, makes apparent that turbo blankets are generally a good thing, and can't harm your engine or turbo.",abarth

I digress. Stages don‚Äôt mean anything. What these cars need is a dyno, and someone with knowledge of tuning the multi-air engine (at least in the USDM). T-Jet models are much easier to tune. 

Our multi-air engines get spring float past 6.5K, which is miserable for such a tiny engine. There‚Äôs tremendous power to be unlocked. Tork motor sports makes 8K springs for these cars that can really wake the engine after a proper tune with tork and their dyno.",abarth

"very popular cel for these cars..

fyi this happens to my car sometimes and its literally the canister or whatever thats located inside the gas tank.

the only way to avoid it for inspection is to fill your tank, reset the CEL, then keep the tank above 70-75% full meaning do not let it go below 70-75% full.  that means youll have to keep putting in only a few dollars at a time until the DOT monitors all go to ready status (100-150 miles of driving).  after you pass you dont have to worry about it and the light may come back but you can just repeat this process.

that being said, definitely make sure nothing is actually wrong with the car besides this...if this is all it is its really not a huge deal.  it can also happen if the crappy gas cap isnt sealing properly anymore.  so theres that...for me luckily it turned out to be that canister inside the gas tank or whatever it is...passed inspection by doing what i said above..if thats your concern.",abarth
"Check cables (it's common for the cable ends to be loose). Check battery voltage/ have it load tested (amperage test/CCA). Check fuse at terminal. Check CPU to battery connection (maybe add a washer to it). Have your starter and alternator checked. Those are the primary things to check if all it takes to start it is a jump. From my experience with this and other vehicles in general, when that starts to happen, it's a starter (or the solenoid) going out. These cars can turn over using a 300cca lawn mower battery. If the starter is drawing 3 or 4 volts (starting from a 12.8v battery down to 9 or 8 volts), the starter is drawing too much power and ""doesn't know what to do with it"". Grab a volt meter and check the battery when you start the car. The initial draw should give you some good info, assuming the battery is charged and okay.",abarth

"Component set for up front (cheap but a good brand or expensive, but expensive speakers are usually more power hungry and need an amplifier as well). Component means door woofers + separate tweeters, sometimes with an crossover box. Coaxial is both in one speaker, good for rear speakers or cars without front tweeters, but the 500 has tweeters in the A-pillar. You don't want coaxials and then also the tweeters in the A-pillar at the same time, it creates interference and too much treble. Rear speakers are not important at all IMO.

But I've been building and toying with forced induction cars for over a decade (my first build was an 800hp B5 Audi S4, an extremely finicky twin turbo motor), and more importantly, there's gobs of actual research that's much more sound than ""I've had conversations with 3 people"" or my personal experience.

It's not a really a complicated subject and you might be holding onto the wrong conclusion too tightly in the face of opposing evidence. 

Turbo blankets keep heat in the hot side of the turbo, which is good, and that, by nature, also helps keep heat **out** of the cold side of the turbo, which is also good.

It's worth noting that modern starters can generally turn over an engine down to a voltage below that where the ECU won't be able to fire the engine. I'd guess a 1.4l with slightly lower compression for the turbo should be pretty easy.

"As you are talking about the Euro spec Abarths, I can't speak to the specific measurements (I'm in the US)...however, you should also keep in mind the roof of your 595. If there's a sunroof/moonroof, the ceiling will be lower than if it's a hard-top. I'm almost 6' 2"" and don't fit into the US Abarth with the sunroof...but fit fine in the cabrio and the hard top (which mine is). No matter your overall height, also, you have to take into account how much of your size is due to long legs or torso.  Also, I have size 13 US (12.5 UK) shoes and frequently find myself hitting the edge of the throttle pedal when I'm on the brakes.  As has been said...take a long test drive, getting into and out of the car several times to be sure how you're fitting.",abarth

"Have had my Abarth since 2018. I would never think about putting a car seat in mine. Do yourself a favor and find a 4-door. The hell of pulling that red strap to get access to the back seat every time you need to strap your kid in will get tiresome very quickly. And then when that red strap breaks (both of mine are broke and nearly impossible to fix), you will need to use the INNER handles to have the seat slide up. I think buying this car at that price and with an infant is a big mistake.

If this is what's happening in your case, it won't be long before the ring is no longer catching on the socket and you will have no side to side shifting ability at all, meaning the only gears you'll have are 3rd and 4th. Take out the battery and the battery tray and look down in there to find the bushings in question. The closest one is forward and back, and the further away one is left and right.",abarth

"Sure, if you get a Bluetooth capable OBDII scanner you can interface with apps that will read the ECU and scan for codes and drive cycle readiness. Typically, a code will set off a drive cycle monitor and it won't pass the drive cycle readiness test. If I had an emissions code or something affecting my engine, it would say something along the lines of ""Failed"" or ""Not Ready"". If the vehicle had a fault code, one could reset the fault/check engine light code and make it disappear long enough to sell the car and cash the check, but they'd also be resetting the readiness monitor. This leaves you with an opportunity to check the readiness monitor and if a whole bunch of Not Ready's appear you can (maybe) assume that the faults have been reset recently as it takes a fair amount of driving to run through those checks again, basically you can't explicitly tell they've reset the codes but you can tell they've reset OBDII data recent enough for something to be fishy.
I use the app ""Torque"" and while it does cost 5 bucks it's pretty customizable and I'm happy with it. There are other apps that will perform the same readiness readouts for free.",abarth

I was a bit worried at first given the price was pretty low but reviews were positive and I've been happy. I haven't tried them on the track or anything but they've stood up to a year and a half of light hooning. I'd say for daily driving with white rims that ceramic pads are a godsend.",abarth

It's fast, it works every time, I installed a custom launcher, I can install every app I want, even Netflix, the steering wheel controls are working too, I need to fit the reverse camera (maybe) and would be nice to have a better looking plastic trim but it's light years from the original stereo, I kept putting myself in troubles while using the navigation on my phone, this just works",abarth

I would think that any passive or purely mechanical modification would run as needed. The computer controlled stuff being changed would need a remap. Then the passive mods would allow for the real performance gains from the remap.

"On a related note, what's the difference between the North American rear suspension and the Euro rear suspension? Is it a spring/damper tuning difference or is there actually a physical difference that would prevent mounting Euro dampers in a North American 500? 

It seems odd to me that Fiat would use different structural parts between the two as it would increase cost. 
If it's just different rate springs and different damper tune then what's the difference?",abarth
"I dont know if it would help in your case, but twice ive needed something fixed i ended up ordering the part myself for them to use. I think dealerships/shops will only order through certain vendors or are just stubborn and dont want you to usurp their absurd profit margins. When the gas cap seal on my BMW busted the dealer said it would be $60 and two weeks to get the part. I ordered a whole new generic Mini Cooper cap (which BMW uses) from Amazon for $14 and it was at my house in two days. When i had my C8 Stingray one of the front fascia parts broke off, the dealer was on backorder for a month and the part was going to be $170. I found the exact part prepainted for $50 on ebay with 5 day shipping and got it myself.

"The 500 Abarth engine, in its original state, doesn't move too far from its thermal limit, partly due to the compact design within the engine bay. Therefore, I would only use oil with at least W50 viscosity (especially in summer). I personally switched from Abarth 10W50 to Motul 8100 Power 5W50. According to my research, the Motul Specific 0101 10W50 has a slightly lower quality base oil compared to the 8100 Power, but is still a good oil of course.

Financially there is no point to switch to 5W40, as the 5W50 alternatives cost around the same. In Germany 5L of Motul 8100 Power cost round about 50 EUR. And as others have stated before, don't cheap out on oil, but at the same time the prices of the Selenia 10W50 are just unreasonable imho.

I change the oil more or less twice a year, roughly every 10k km. With a rather small engine oil capacity of close to 3L, frequent changes are a must. I drive a 2009 T-Jet EsseEsse.",abarth

"Noticed the other day that I got a bit more boost than normal pulling away... needle all the way around the dial!   
Then a few mins later the dreaded engine management light popped up, warning on the dash (the whole cluster went super bright!) and into limp mode, limited revs! 

  
Turned the car off and back on again (you can tell I work in IT!) and apart from the engine management light being constantly lit, the car was ok ish. I had a bit of boost back, but the needle still wanted to go all the way around & if I kept going for it, back into limp mode.  
  
Got the ODB gadget hooked up, fired up Torque and ""P0240 - Powertrain Turbo/Super Charger Boost Sensor ""B"" Circuit Range/Performance"" came up.  
I had a look under the bonnet, apart from a bit of oil being in places it shouldn't be (another tale!!!) visually things seemed ok.  
  
So off to the interwebs, a bit of sleuthing later I had decided my issue was the Pierburg boost control solenoid, so I ordered a slightly better one up and a nice silicone intake hose, if I had to take the stock one off to get to the valve, a fancy one might as well go back on!

  
All the bits arrive Friday morning, I was working from home so I went out to start the job at lunch time. 10 minutes later I came back indoors cursing as I had just discovered a split vacuum line I didn‚Äôt notice before... 150mm/6"" of 5mm ID hose between the turbo & boost control solenoid with a spilt had caused all my issues.  
Ordered up a couple of meters of 5mm ID (2.5mm wall) silicone vacuum hose & some clamps which arrived by Saturday lunchtime.

  
Today, all the new bits went on even though it was only ¬£1 of vacuum hose that needed replacing. I did replace all 3 lines to the boost control solenoid too.  
Full boost ahead.

  
(excess oil... the drain bolt on the oil catch can was awol!)   
  
TLDR; P0240 cause by a split in 150mm of 5mm ID vacuum hose between the turbo and the boost control solenoid",abarth

They think it's the CV axles since no codes were popping up and their inspection of the engine and transmission came back good. 

Vibrations got really obvious when I swapped over to coilovers. So I suspect it's because the car is sitting lower and the cv axles don't like the new angle that it sits on.

The cowl intake pulls air from outside. Its louder because it is right behind the dash. Performance increase can be up to 5-7% in some cases. The upgraded intake just allows the air to flow better. You arent really going to get more air in the system than it ever could. It just has less restrictions. A K&N filter and some silicone tubing replacement for stock intake for the airbox. Will give just about the same performance. And is quieter. Better off replacing the inter-cooler with a better model.,abarth

"Got mine 1.5 years ago, 2014 Abarth 500 (California only) with 78,000 miles. $7,800 private party. However it did require some work, front axles and other stuff; ~$2k of work and parts. I still think it‚Äôs within the value marker for the car in its current/better state. 

I think that seller will have a hard time getting it sold at $12k though.",abarth

"Yeah, mine is a '13 as well with ~60k miles. I put my borscope in the cylinder when I did plugs for the first time and was absolutely astonished by the amount of carbon. I purchased mine used and feel like it never had a proper Italian tune-up during its previous life.

I've run several bottles of Gumout carbon cleaner thru it during my ownership and have seen good results. Unfortunately it really needs a head off service to clean up the rest of the carbon.",abarth

"Just a heads up, performance brakes don't make you stop any faster, they just don't heat up as easily or wear under mechanically stressful scenarios like track driving as easily. You can completely lock the wheels with the cheapest brakes out there, they can stop just as fast, it's just if given hell e.g. on a track, standard brakes will wear much faster than performance brakes and lose efficiency as they get hot.",abarth

"I have a North American 500 Abarth. I would never use my car for commuting if I could avoid it. I tried it last summer to get to my new job, and it quickly became a nightmare!

In four months, I stopped walking everywhere, I was stressed out by the traffic on the highway (no serious traffic jams, just very bad Ottawa drivers), and I actually started hating driving my Abarth!

If the exhaust valve hadn't blown when it did (üòÅ) , I never would have realized just how bad things got in my life until I started taking public transportation again and discovered I couldn't run anymore to catch the bus!

Yes, the trip to work and home is longer, but it's one train and one bus each way with easy pedestrian access to my regular grocery store near my home. And unlike my car, I can sleep or surf the net on the bus and not pay attention to anything that's happening on the road!

Even more important, I now enjoy driving my Abarth again just for the fun of it and not because I have to drive it. That alone makes a huge difference.

If I ever do need a proper commuter car, I would most likely get something I didn't care about one bit like a Mitsubishi Mirage.",abarth
"True, already around $1500 out, and its still there. But at least almost everything other than the CV axle rebuilt was either routine maintenance or upgrade.",abarth

"900+labor.  so expect around 1500 id say...maybe more..  


besides any obvious stuff like pulling to the left or right or feeling vibrations...im really not a mechanic so its hard to think off the top of my head :X  id say just make sure you try and listen to the suspension, and if you can check the ""cv boots"" lol like i dont know shit about that stuff but i know everyone says to make sure the axles and ""cv boots"" :P  anyway yea if theres no other codes its hard for me to think of stuff because i never work on the car haha im just sharing knowledge ive gained over the years :P  


hopefully they did regular oil changes at like 3000 miles...sorry i dont know what else to look out for haha.  uhhh if you have an obd2 bluetooth device then you should bring that and connect it to torque app on your phone and make sure the AFR is good and when you accelerate see if its doing 18psi stock (meaning no flash tune).  idk if that would maybe eliminate the turbo being a potential issue :P  


hopefully someone else can chime in on what to look for on the test drive..",abarth
That's an awesome color choice.,abarth
"Some might not fit the calipers but the biggest issue is the rear sway-bar that will rub. You can grind a bit of the radius of the sway-bar mount down or get an aftermarket sway-bar that will give more room.

Edit: It's also hard to find tires the exact same size. 
I have ones that are 4% smaller in diameter so I have to take that into account as the speedometer under reads by 4%

I did notice a slightly better ride, likely from reduced unsprung weight, and zero change in handling. 

Tire pressure should also be corrected which might lead to a TPMS warning.",abarth

Got the OEM Abarth updated look on my car. Not as difficult as everyone is saying. The series 3 lights fit fine. The drls are different but you can buy a harness to make them plug and play.,abarth
I have not been at a specialist. Just asking here. I love my abarth but would like to upgrade my gearbox. To move to 260hp and 400nm. The stock automatic gearbox wil not handle 400nm. That is why i would like to upgrade it to maybe a strong mini John cooper gearbox. That can handle 400/450nm with a duel clutch. Like a DSG,abarth

"That just means it‚Äôs dead. A new fully charged battery is 12.56v not 12v. 12 is nearly dead. As batteries age the fully charged Vs get lower. So, in a perfect world it will be 12.56 and drop to no lower than 11 under cranking.",abarth
"Based on how my 113k Abarth is doing, I imagine if the whole cooling system hasn't been replaced it needs to be and it should be on it's 3rd timing belt. I don't see how it could live that long unless it was will taken care of. For 2500 I would take the risk if after a thorough inspection.",abarth
I mean like do I need any special tools or something I have the obvious things to fix a normal car lol. I think I'm fairly comfortable doing it if it's nothing special.,abarth

"I've had my back seats removed completely for a number of years. Last year I did a full Ikea run from Columbus to Cleveland. That included a bed frame and its rolled up mattress, various other kitchen thingies (I was moving into a new house), as well as all the other doodads one tends to collect on an Ikea run.

Is this compatible with the U.S. Abarths?,abarth
"Limp mode. OBD2 scanner. Check scanner for codes & misfires. Listen for rough idle. Pull spark plugs & check their state - there are charts online. If the plugs look off, replace & check your ignition coils. If only one cylinder is misfiring, swap that coil with one from a different cylinder. If the cylinder you swapped it to starts misfiring, then pull that coil & replace. Run a compression test on each cylinder. If one is way down, then it could be anything from a headgasket to a damaged block/head. Drain oil - if its milky, replace the headgasket. If none of the codes are serious, personally I'd clear them. If they don't come back, give her an Italian tune-up AFTER fresh oil & gas.

Edit: If you reset the ecu by pulling fuses or the battery, do not go full send/WOT. It will need to go through a relearning procedure - drive it like a grandma until the idle comes down & acceleration is smooth. Back off if it surges, lurches, or behaves abnormally.",abarth

Yeah to me its better than the 500 in every way and is way more practical. Better transmission come standard with a 6speed c635 instead of the c510 the abarth comes in. C635 is rated at 350nm of torque while the c510 is rated at 300. Better handling more aerodynamic makes top speed easier to get too whilest the boxy shape of the 500 keeps it from going faster after 200kmph,abarth

"They were ok but when it was time for rebuild I found that no coilover shops will service them. Even BC themselves don‚Äôt they just sell you the replacement. Which will cost you like brand new.

"Only mechanical thing I‚Äôve had to replace is the throttle body in the 1.5 years since I‚Äôve had her (knock on wood). I‚Äôve had to buy tires and suspension and brakes but those wear normally. It‚Äôs so fun. I actually daily her and love her so much. I knew I wanted her as my first car for a long time. I‚Äôve been so proud of how well she has held up because reliability was another concern of mine too. Granted, I only have 78,800 miles and it came from California so there was no rust. The higher the mileage the more worn things will be, and it also depends on how it was taken care of in the past, so when looking, my best advice is patience to make sure you get one that was taken care of!",abarth
Hot hatches aren‚Äôt about top speed though? Hot hatches shine at lower speeds,abarth
"It was an Abarth, sick ass car too. All your cars are slow btw",abarth
"IHI does that, and it gives what we call ""turbolag"". That's the reason why Fiat (notoriously slow at changing designs) fixed the new models with the Garret turbine. IHI turbolag however can be fixed with a good stage 1 tuning.",abarth
"Idk I guess, last abarth for me I like my Honda at 400k",abarth
"My car is slow as hell. I don‚Äôt pretend it speedy because it‚Äôs a driver‚Äôs car with a manual. I‚Äôve owned faster cars than yours, and the speed gets old quick. I‚Äôd much rather row my own gears than have the car do all of the work for me!",abarth
"Just sounds like an Abarth to me. Like I said theres things I love about it, if it was more reliable it'd be a perfect daily beater. But the bad things really take away from the car. Its like everyday that I drive it I'm saying ""whats next?"" In the back of my mind.",abarth

Thats if you pay someone $1600 in labor. You could take the hood/bonnet off and DIY on your living room floor. How hard do you think it is to lay a flat sticker on the roof? The fender and bumpers etc would be tougher. But not by much. They aren't some Lambo bumpers or nothing.,abarth

"Straight piped exhaust (no back box) due to our regulations, proper auto option vs Euro's MTA and Hyper Black? wheel option on the Esseesse style rims to name a few. US did have the circular window buttons before the Euro finally got them on the Series 4 which always looked smarter.



Even within Euro zone though the specs differ. 695 Tribute Ferrari had a satellite alarm feature, UK didn't get it. Same with carbon pedals, told that's a left hand drive only option.



Japan has far more official aftermarket accessories, like interior lights (rear and footwells, dash cams, illuminated key barrels and a mobile holder that uses the cup holder. They also got the plush scorpion I believe :(",abarth
It still drives just as fun. Probably runs a lot better than a piggyback version.  Idk what to say I scooped it up in 2020 as a new 2018.  It was the last Abarth sold new in America üò¢ was sitting in Colorado Springs getting no love.  Originally bought for my wife but she never learned to drive all this time.

"Best bet is to buy a manual gearbox that can handle the output.

The Aisin 5AT that was designed for the abarth (and later homologated to fit the dodge dart) would only ever be able to withstand, safely, around 220-230 wheel horsepower, which is already quite a hefty bump from factory. But even at this rate, the transmissions life will decrease drastically. 

Swap a 5MT and other supporting parts, get a nice clutch and flywheel combo, and never worry about it again. Much cheaper that way too. And it‚Äôs a lot more fun to drive. And it‚Äôs more serviceable.",abarth
Thanks heard about that. Gonna check,abarth
Abarth in Europe is T-Jet and i used 5w40 and then got very strong advise to put Abarth oil which i did. It may seem as dense as honey at first but dont worry since it get viscous at right temps.,abarth

"Not a whole lot of performance benefit to remove the factory filter box. The intake pipe and the exit to the turbo can be replaced. Thats about it. Slap a K&N in there or whatever. 1% or 2% gain isn't gonna be worth it. Start changing parts like the turbo. Then the motor would need a larger or less restrictive filter box etc. Really needs a tune to fully benefit with aftermarket parts. 

Also...Some people like the clean look of the stock filter box. Aftermarket stuff usually exposes the motor. Its ugly compared. Dress kits a few. So everyone has the same options etc. Yuck.",abarth

It just kills me that the stigma with certain vehicles is so bad that companies will produce millions of parts that sit on the shelf for years. Rather than make a few extra rims that might eventually sell for Fiats.,abarth
"A person could easily spend 40-50k on current high end mods. Cams, crank, big turbo and brakes. Easily 12-13k installed. Racing transmission and clutch with an LSD could be another 15-20k. It goes on and on. Thousands in carbon dress up parts and lightened engine and drive-train stuff. Its pretty specific. The US cars really wont make more than 300hp reliably after heavy mods. The Euro cars are making 400+. But its a wild out of control ride. Not really useful.",abarth

I wouldn't worry about fuel issues yet.",abarth

"According to the owner's manual, the timing belt is replaced at 150,000 miles or 15 years - whichever comes first. 

Normally for something like this, I don't trust a belt to last 15 years. Probably a good idea to change it out a couple of years earlier.",abarth
"Yea it does get faster as the revs get higher, but it only scales with engine speed, not with the speed of the tires. The mechanic was by the way very sorry and they are doing a free checkup of the whole transmission and clutch on the coming Monday. Maybe they just had a newbie working on my car and forgot to put my new throwout bearing in and noticed it now, so I hope. Then it wouldn‚Äôt be that bad. But if the transmission is dead that would be a bummer",abarth

"If you keep the car to the end of the PCP the final payment (the large final payment - probably ¬£8k-¬£10k-, sometimes known as a balloon payment) will still be the same. You can then hand it back to the dealer/finance company or pay off the final payment.",abarth
"Fun fact that most people wouldn't pay attention to. The Esseesse wheels are different between the US and Euro cars. The style is the same, but the abarth logo on the wheels is raised for the euro cars and recessed on the US car. 

Structurally, the US car is stronger. It's got a stronger roof, reinforced rockers, rear cross members, side members, and frame rails to name a few... all to pass US safety standards. Which also meant a revised fire wall tunnel? Which was their official excuse as to why the US car never got a 6 speed manual because it wouldn't fit.",abarth
Pretty good.  I also added it to the wheel wells. Definitely all around reduces noise. Door shut sounds like a Bentley.,abarth

There's a sticker on the gearbox that confirms it, but it is not easy to see. Your best bet is to put the front wheels on air and see if when turning one side forward the other one goes ~~backwards~~ forward too.

"Yep, unfortunately this is how the cookie crumbles with newer cars. This can leave people in sticky situations with car finance, which is why I always get unsecured bank loans for part of the value.

Depreciation - 5-7 year old cars tend to be where the depreciation curve smooths out. Will still depreciate‚Ä¶ but slower.

Unsecured Bank loan - With these there‚Äôs no other finance party involved and you will own the car 100%. As long as you can get a great interest rate and put enough deposit down, you‚Äôre highly unlikely to be in negative equity. You can sell the car whenever you like too.

Seating position is not ideal for a sporty driving, but I'm used to it already and I feel comfortable pushing it harder. When I floor it in 2nd gear and see the boost gauge go to max I can't help but laugh. A tiny city car with a boost gauge? It's ridiculous, in a good way. I used to own an Mk6 VW GTI, and while it was a better car in every measurable way, it wasn't as fun. The Abarth just makes you laugh, I love it. Is it better than my R8?

"$160 an hour? American?!? Ouch!

A mechanic on site was even ready to buy it for themselves if I didn't want to get it fixed.

"I'm not sure how to post a picture but my Fiat tech sent a picture of a Usunrise Higher Pressure Oil Can, and then said this:

""How to prime a multi-air:

First you will need an oil can or a grease gun with a pin hole applicator. Install about 1/4 quart into the gun. Also make sure you have the proper level of oil in the engine. 

Open the oil cap to expose the multi-air actuator. From there you will see two holes, one is just a bolt (usually a black bolt) so make sure that is not the one you apply oil to. The other hole will be smaller and should be silver in color. Insert applicator and pump the oil in. Close the fill cap and try to start. It may take two-three cranks. If its not starting apply more oil to the multi-air and try again. Don't crank to often as you can burn the starter.""",abarth
"The pops and bangs occur when the engine is running too rich. With a pop and bang tune this is induced by choice. The noise is unburnt fuel exploding within the exhaust. 

There's potential for damage and over the long term you may coke up the engine. You would need to think about servicing more often, which is a given with any 3rd party tune. 

Our Abarth can pop and bang with the standard tune and I've noticed when I do force it to do it it tends to damage the O2 sensors in the exhaust forcing me to replace them. Gone through a way too many in just 50k miles. 

It's your car at the end of the day, do what you want with it. Though, don't expect people to respect you as you pop and bang passed their bedroom windows!",abarth
Did you hurt her feelings?,abarth
There is a cover that can be removed to inspect the belt. Because your car is so low mileage I wouldn't be concerned that it has stretched out of spec so if the belt and teeth aren't cracked you should be good until 15 years. I'm dreading replacing mine as it looks like a real PITA,abarth

"That's not how it works at all. At worst is some heatsoak due to the stock intake sitting in the hottest area of the engine bay, but most of the decent aftermarket intakes solve that problem (as best as possible). The heat from compression is going to be way more than a slightly hotter turbo, and the stock turbo cooling system is plenty to handle a marginal increase.",abarth

Regarding the front, it seems like it should line up with the body panels, but- there‚Äôs likely very different support structure underneath the bumper, and there‚Äôs no telling if that would fit due to the difference in euro regulations versus US.",abarth

Inside there is a topway TS10 motherboard, the board is great but the display is terrible, you can find the board alone on aliexpress if you like but you will need to find the back shroud and the cables.

I never figured out how to build it, I ended up glueing this to the front of the old one, remove all the buttons and just route the new wires. 

The display is sold as a ""QLED 2K"" screen, is QLED? no idea, looks good? absolutelly, the company that sold it to me are not on aliexpress anymore but they do have a telegram channel:
