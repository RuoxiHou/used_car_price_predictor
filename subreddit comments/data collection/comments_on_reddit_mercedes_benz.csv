C easily,mercedes_benz
Thanks.,mercedes_benz
"Fair enough. They are a dime/dozen in my neighborhood and suburb. There are Taycans and i7s everywhere though. 

I‚Äôd still not purchase any of them. I personally do not enjoy electric cars. My wife had a Model X back when they first came out and it lasted about 1 years with us until she wanted to go back to her LR. 

We tried it. It‚Äôs just not for us. That is until they extend ranges significantly.",mercedes_benz
"I have never seen DA2 on any gla‚Äôs but they are far and few between in the glb. Whatever of those models that currently have it in dealers are it til at least next year. 

I know the dash was an option for glb, gle, gls.. but good luck ever finding it.

From experience people prefer the gla over the glb if those are your options. I‚Äôve driven them, and the lumbar support on the glb was horrendous, it was a most uncomfortable test drive. the gla was much nicer, although I wanted something larger. 

Dealers would rather sell you a car they have on the lot usually, but if you know what you want and find a good dealer, they‚Äôll get it for you.",mercedes_benz

"I mean, why should the dealer give you a loaner for 6 weeks. Your insurance should provide you with a car. Atleast that's what they do where I'm from",mercedes_benz
Ngl I did see that but I was confident my luck would hold up‚Ä¶. God damn was I wrong but I already dug this grave so I‚Äôll lie in it for a year then upgrade but for now any advice to make it last longer when I get it back? Or advice on a reliable‚Ä¶.Mercedes car? Somehow even with this experience I still love those cars,mercedes_benz
"Yeah I get it lol. Don't get me wrong, the Toyotas I've had were great, but they still occasionally needed some small things here and there like an alternator, water pump, engine mount, etc. 

Meanwhile that Jetta literally never failed lol",mercedes_benz
My grandpas w246 has it aswell,mercedes_benz
Amen and congrats. We have a 1968 Dodge Cornet Convertible in the family. Never in my life did a car's acceleration scare me like that one.,mercedes_benz
"One vote for Michelin Pilot Sport AS 4, have a set on my GLB35. Purchased a year ago, drove in packed snow (last year when new and again a few weeks ago) and hot weather (to 110¬∞F) and heavy rain, didn't even bother to put my summer P Zero tires back on last summer.

9k miles, 10mm new and 8mm now with even wear at the first rotation and now (I check). Not too noisy, decent milage, responsive handling for any tire besides track-rated tires (raced off and on for about 40 years). Would buy these again in a heartbeat.",mercedes_benz

About 220 miles a week. I have a long commute and my wife takes the car on the days I work from home.,mercedes_benz
"I had a similar problem in my 2017 gla 250 at \~100,000 miles. Mine turned out to be a problem in the rear differential. My mechanic friends made me turn in circles for a while and you could actually hear the squeaking/skidding sound as well as feel it very strongly. Doing a differential fluid flush solved the issue and cost me about $250.",mercedes_benz
"I know what you mean about the cleanliness - I lived in Germany and it was beautifully spotless! 

Seriously for a new grad - even as a gift - I‚Äôd recommend something reliably boring and less expensive like the Avalon, or Camry or Accord.
Mainly because they should probably throw the extra money into a 401k or IRA rather than an expensive, depreciating car. Even if it‚Äôs new and warrantied. And if it was a gift I‚Äôd ask the giver if I could get the cheap boring option and throw the difference in savings.",mercedes_benz
"Agree. End of the day, all we can do is give advice and OP has their right to choose. I‚Äôve definitely made some dumb buys in my dawn years also haha",mercedes_benz
"Driven one 5hours+, beautiful interior but lacks beauty on the exterior. Fast but it‚Äôs nowhere near as fun as an equally fast gas car(or most manual cars, imo). So all things considered, especially the price, no.",mercedes_benz
Why would insurance provide a loaner for a mechanical failure?,mercedes_benz
"As a counter-point, my 2012 CLS550 just crossed 200,000 miles. It has never needed a major repair. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs pretty reliable.

That‚Äôs about to change however, since the front air suspension is starting to go.

Obviously, you can‚Äôt judge brand or model reliability from anecdotal evidence. It‚Äôs meaningless.",mercedes_benz

"I have a GLC300 but I have driven both.  The A class is a collaboration with Renault.  It is a sub compact with a sporty and peppy engine but does not really feel or ride like a Mercedes but is a beautiful little car on the outside and is designed for young people like OP just getting started with the brand.  I thought the one I drove to be just like Hyundai Kona or Venue.  It is designed as a car to be a move up.  I diskied the interior, especially the seats which looked cheap to me.

The C class is a real Mercedes.  It is much more comfortable with a much nicer interior.  It is a much nicer car.  It has a smooth ride and a nice engine but is not a pocket rocket.  It is still a compact car.  I preferred the C class as similar to many other C class cars but is vastly superior to all of them.  The brand new ones have a solid engine but a lot of new electronics which can be problematic with bad luck.  Consider a used one with low mileage as an option to save some money.  The 2016-2020 w205 is very reliable, the 2021-2023 are great.  I have no stats on the 2024.",mercedes_benz
Drive it and see what you like,mercedes_benz
What u mean 'trans was done'? Ain't nothing to do in these afaik. Tranny fluid is for life. The c63 needs regular tranny oil changes.,mercedes_benz

"Only the 2nd keys to the cars, that are kept in the closet. Personally, i don't carry more around than a simple key ring...",mercedes_benz
"It‚Äôs like the size of an E coupe. E class starts around $60 for a 4-cylinder. Sometimes people are buying luxury and styling, not cylinders.",mercedes_benz
"i like the new key. i never had the one in the middle but between the sides i prefer the new one. i like a heavy key... makes it feel substantial lol. and also i never forget which pocket it's in, which is a huge plus for me. and of course, as Boris the Bullet Dodger liked to say... Heavy is Good. Heavy is reliable. If it doesn't work you can always hit them with it.",mercedes_benz

"Haha ok 
I'm coming from a 2016 lexus is350 an I've heard it's bigger than that so I'm super intimidated",mercedes_benz
"I like the 4 cylinder in the 45 AMGs.¬†

I'm not as precious about it in other models either - the main issues for me are the crappy electronics and quality of the last few years, prioritizing gimmicks like ambient lighting over designing and building the cars properly.

The cars really dropped I quality in the 2000s, they worked to improve them, and now they've thrown all of that progress away.",mercedes_benz

If you‚Äôre going to get a base model benz. Get you a used 2017-2019 e class with low miles. You‚Äôll be much happier and save money.,mercedes_benz

Where is the conductor plate? Is this DIY?,mercedes_benz
I currently live in India we just got the c43 here.,mercedes_benz
Or they‚Äôve driven some and know that Mercedes isn‚Äôt the same anymore,mercedes_benz
The C class is still a super extreme case,mercedes_benz
"It has nothing to do with whether u get better quality because it's a C or an E. It would've made hella diff if we were in the 90s to latter part of 2000s. 

Ever since the manufacturers started making all of their line ups look the same with only the differences in length width and height, the good old glory days were gone. 

You wouldn't know the diff from a block away whether that Merc u you just bought today is an S, E, C nor CLS/CLA, etc etc and so on and so forth. 

Picture Starbucks coffee. Venti, grande and so forth. Same God damn coffee.

Get the older model 63s.",mercedes_benz

"80something s class. If you‚Äôre paying for the car yourself, get something older and, MADE IN GERMANY. If your parents are paying get the C300.",mercedes_benz
"I had a variety of e classes those were the ones I kept and used for years on end. I personally think w210 was the last great car made, its planted on the road but yet you feel like you float on the road its the comfiest car I ever owned as a base model.    


Funny you ask, I am actually looking at a w211 wagon, and a w210 (om606 build) as a project car. As much as I would love an e55 or e63 wagon, I just cant justify that displacement and no luck in using it anywhere. I do hope one day to be able to have a w211 and just let her rip on a drift track... maybe I'll do that when the other house projects are settled in.   


C-class is another story for another day, but there are great builds there too. I just enjoy the size of E's more and after starting on C's, I knew they weren't for me long term.   


You opened a can of worms though, W212 e63 wagon would be my final car if mercedes or anyone ever comes with a proper fix for that slow reacting, but hard shifting 7g. It pisses me off that they can get away with that and call it ""normal"" when it is in a luxury line of cars, and I actually sued MB and won for these transmission issues, they threw some money at me, rebuilt the transmission internally and it was fine for a year or two and then the hard shifts came back. If anyone wants to say I drive them hard, I sport them from time to time, but I'm also the guy that posted a 35mpg avg in a gas w210 years ago on the MB forum so I know my cars and how to drive them. The other route I would love to go is a wagon, manual w210 diesel with the w124 injector upgrade. No bells and whistles, just pure machine and driving train, nothing fancy. W211 is a timeless design like you said, which is why I want one to be able to take the kids and load their bikes on it to the park.",mercedes_benz
Well that‚Äôs the thing.. I don‚Äôt know if I like it or not still getting used to everything üòÇ,mercedes_benz
"And sometimes they will do just that! My dad has one that busted out of its housing. I think he still has the 2 original keys from when he bought that car new!

"The og IR Master Key was the best (1997-2000).

It was an elongated version of the ones from 2001 onward, but the built in manual key is massive and feels nice.

They got progressively shittier and shittier since.",mercedes_benz
"It‚Äôs not priced 50k off because it‚Äôs a bad car. Are there bad to things to it like every car? Yes but it is bad, no üíÄ.",mercedes_benz

C 300 is the best car I‚Äôve owned as a daily! O seriously love this car!,mercedes_benz
"It kind of looks spooked, or surprised, like someone poked it in the butt. LOL",mercedes_benz
"It may be bigger and longer than the E-Coupe was, but it drives, looks and feels like a C Coupe. I drove the CLE 300 when it arrived, and I was neither pleased or disappointed.. it was‚Ä¶ alright.

the price is insane - and they will not sell.",mercedes_benz
"title says eqg, not egg",mercedes_benz
"Slap on the same size and brand you like as the worn out one. Match brands when front is worn out to your favorite one. 

Do note the speed rating on the tire code, country dependent including with the load index. 

And the MO is not that important if tire size , load index and speed rating fits your shits.

Edit; don‚Äôt rotate staggered wheel sets. The rear is supposed to be wider and bigger with different ET value. It‚Äôs where your oomph hits the road üòÇ",mercedes_benz
My dad‚Äôs 2005 E class has this key.. So did my 2010 C series and my 2006 CLK,mercedes_benz
"C 450 is not an AMG, bub. Also, I find it hilarious that people talk about a car's value. Unless you use it for work or buy a modern classic, no car is an investment. Let people buy what they like and enjoy their money, stop pinching pennies",mercedes_benz
"I don't know your financial standing, but cars are really an emotional decision once you know what you can afford. I'll assume you know about maintenance costs and upkeep. with that out the way, our 23' c300 has been treating us well. comfortable, quiet, and is great overall as a daily. once again, compare what you like the most and go with that",mercedes_benz
"Probably alpaca grey, I had that on my 2014 E550 coupe. Great color combo with brushed aluminum!",mercedes_benz
"He, when the CLE 53 came out I was considering turning my '21 C43 Coup√© in for it.

I think I'll better wait for the Facelift version.",mercedes_benz
The thermostats in this engine also have issues,mercedes_benz
C300 is a much better quality. However I doubt the prices are the same. So it‚Äôs really going to come down to budget.,mercedes_benz
These 260 engines were developed and manufactured as a joint venture with Nissan. They are hot fucking garbage. Not surprised at all it gave up.,mercedes_benz
W124 over W202 for sure,mercedes_benz
"I wanted this car, but in a wagon. Alas, in the US our V8 options were limited to the ‚Äú6.3‚Äù for wagons. I got the 3.5 car, darn near same interior as this but I have the ash/grey (I‚Äôm forgetting the real name) wood trim.",mercedes_benz
Basically avoid cheap tyres and fit a premium brand. Your choice could end up being life or death decision.,mercedes_benz

"What's the issue here? It's like $15k over base, so it's got lots of options. The amount of cylinders is irrelevant. This is a luxury car. Luxury cars cost a lot of money.",mercedes_benz

"My key looks just like that, it's a clc",mercedes_benz

"Honestly I'd pick neither one. They're gonna drop thousands in the next 24 months.

So I'd buy a used S63 Amg pre-covid for about $30 to $35 grand and¬† be happy.",mercedes_benz
Never had either myself. I had a w205 43 but that was it. The 205 definitely had rattle issues but even mine wasn't bad. Worst I had was trim creak in that at times. The eqs has zero. It's dead quiet in that car which is even more insane since there's no engine noise to cover up sounds. It's really impressive.,mercedes_benz
"Right, that‚Äôs pretty much normal when it comes to german cars, but how‚Äôs your personal experience with such a mileage? For example how much have you had to spend on maintenance since you got your AMG?

I know that for my RS5, after about 15 months of ownership I spent around 2k. I bought mine at 100k miles and being a german car I figured that‚Äôs not too bad",mercedes_benz
In NL you can go buy an early 2000s C class. With the same money you‚Äôll find an example very far away from reaching 250k km.,mercedes_benz
That‚Äôs the plan right now,mercedes_benz
"IMHO its the best car to start (2024)

That's the point. The more you save now the larger it will be when you do retire and the better your life will be. You can't go back in time and save more. Uness you're already on track to become a high earner then you need to consider the high likelihood you'll maybe top out between 60-100k and that's very little money.,mercedes_benz

"My M133 engine has been flawless and behaves like an engine should work with that much engineering put into it. It has plenty of features to deal with the high cylinder pressure and extra heat that come with that much hp/L. Don't get me wrong the CLA has had its share of complaints but it's never the engine that owners are having issues with. Occasionally they had turbo failures 1st gen pre fl, but those are Borg Warner. And the first couple of years they came out they had transmission issues. For a decade now, that 200 hp per liter engine has been reliable, there's plenty of them with over 100,000 miles. The block is good for 600 hp conservatively but very few people push them that far due to maxing out the stock high-pressure fuel pump and only 1 company makes an aftermarket one and its like $6,000, it might be more expensive I can't remember. If you can manage the heat issues you can make a reliable engine with that much power, it also helps if you keep the max rpms down, like the mid 6k range as AMG did. It's not gonna be a 300k mile engine, but it's reliable nonetheless.",mercedes_benz

What you've already done is probably where I'd stop and put any additional money you were going to spend into a fund to buy something nicer later on. It's cheaper to buy up than to upgrade.

"Unfortunately, it probably will be close to a giveaway‚Ä¶ I really do hate to tell you that, but feel the need to prepare you for reality. For reference, I‚Äôm a long-time Mercedes collector and restorer who currently owns several r107s. While the internet is full of ridiculous asking prices, not many are selling anywhere near the ask outside of a few BaT auctions for really perfect cars that got out of hand with bidding wars. Any form of body damage is a value killer these days, even on an otherwise immaculate car. Even though you have the parts, the car will require a full repaint to ever be right. No one can match 45 year old Mercedes paint on half a car. Quality paintwork has gotten insanely expensive (if you can even find anyone to do it) and the job will likely exceed the value of the car. A Maaco tape-and-spray type job will just devalue it. Doing it right involves stripping it of all trim, which opens up numerous cans of worms with all the associated clips and gaskets. It would be a hard sell with a car that was in otherwise perfect driving condition, and probably only taken on by someone with a sentimental connection who doesn‚Äôt care about return on investment. In this case, we have a car that has essentially been sitting for over 20 years. Even though you‚Äôve kept it ‚Äòrunning‚Äô, that isn‚Äôt the same as ‚Äòdriving‚Äô. It likely will need lots of mechanical refreshment as well. I would expect subframe bushings to be crumbling, soft brake line rot, total brake system replacement due to hygroscopic corrosion, and a full climate control rebuild, just to name a few things. Those alone will make up a good portion of the car‚Äôs value. If I were in your shoes, I would probably take as much satisfaction as possible from just seeing it go to someone who will make good use of any of it, rather than seeing it go for scrap. If the interior is particularly nice, for example, that may have some value to someone. Please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being harsh or negative‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really not. I‚Äôm just giving you my most honest assessment as someone who‚Äôs been involved with these cars for a long time. I can also relate to your current position, and the difficulty of making these decisions. My wife passed a few years ago, and I‚Äôm having to downsize.

I feel a leadership review or total replacement is needed.  they seem to be moving further away from the features and values they're core clients and customers want.  Its as though they are letting they're marketing company or contractor tell them how to build a car and what is should consist of.  CASE IN POINT, 4 cylinder sports cars????? seriously did any AMG customer say hey I want you to eliminate 8 cylinder cars and 6 cylinder cars... so that you can replace them with electric 4-cylinder cars... Sure... it's like going to a steak house and ordering a steak, and they say to you... we have a steak for you,  just its made of chicken... but we still call it steak and it is so much better for you and society.  So please pay what you would for that steak that you came to the steakhouse for but accept that its just chicken... cause that is good for the world and the environment???? WHAT ARE THEY SMOKING!!!   I would love to talk to the ONE PERSON who said hey I am so pleased to have gone from my M156 V8,  to my M139... its so much more exciting and fun NOT!!!!!  this company thinks that wealthy hard working owners are just going to follow along??? really... There are so many examples of companies that thought hey we do what we want our clients will just have to accept it and follow are LEAD... hmmm can you say ""BlackBerry"", Nortel, Torstar, and so on and so on... when company begins to think what it knows and does is what you want without asking their customers ""WHAT THEY WANT"" then the future is inevitable.  I am not saying the company will end tomorrow maybe not even in 10+ years... but I assure you their directional change and shift has abandoned clients at the core of its success and this will lead to a weak customer who will buy an AMG one year... and a BMW or a KIA another year... So all I can say is that a key chain is to a customer as important as the car it starts... and if you fail both, making neither the keychain or the car in a way that they customer wants... you will need to find new customers and that will be a slippery slope! ask Blackberry how that went!",mercedes_benz

I go to a mechanic who I trust and has been good  (non dealership) and even their costs aren't cheap but I appreciate their feedback and use of OEM or near OEM products.  But I've noticed my maintenance has been less (knock on wood) than most cars if you stay current overall with brakes lasting  for a long time, tires have been solid and less overall for similar cars (and ice owned Volvo, Chevy, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jeep, Saab, Porsche and several others).  The service bill hurts but I don't see the issues in general and less than most.

My comments are on the lines of neglect and not going to a solid mechanic.  I cringle on every Service B bill or paying $1200 on brakes repairs or $1k for two tires for my wife's car because they are staggered but I am aware of the costs.  I can see alot of people skipping these.  It kills me every time I see a post here about someone wanting a 6-10 year old MB as either their first car or first MB not knowing the cost can skyrocket and I think people skip this stuff too much due to the cost then complain about it dying after 100 or 150k.",mercedes_benz

"Since no one is directly answering part of your question as to why they are different.

In more powerful RWD cars the rear tyres are wider to provide better grip/traction to the rear wheels so that they don't slip when you apply more throttle. It helps avid accidental oversteer essentially. It gove better performance bit realistically for daily driving it adds safety too.

Why the front will be smaller is that they are not powered usually or in a AWD usually receive less power than the rear in many cases so have less need for the same level of grip. Bigger tyres are less feul efficient too so manufacturers avoid putting wider tyres front and back as there isn't really much benefit but clear deficits on a road car.

This is a basic overview of why they're offset. There is more to it but for driving on the road there isn't much else to it than this.",mercedes_benz

Also the panel trims that used to always have a legit wood choice are restricted to black, expensive black with ugly lines, silver shit that‚Äôs going to cause crazy reflections from the sun, black with half assed Benz stars that don‚Äôt have the circles and light up and night giving cops cause to pull one over thinking someone is driving and doom scrolling social media, and the one almost wood choice still has ugly ass metal lines running through it that scream cheap AF. I was going to be willing to bite the bullet and just spend an extra $12k or so for a custom Manufaktur Designo interior; however, regardless that the E class is part of the Manufaktur program the actual trim material choices are the same as the customization is restricted to the S class and Maybach line vehicles.",mercedes_benz

Unfortunately, questions like this are why other vehicles, like my Land Rover Discovery, have worthless gauges that literally point right at the middle at all temps between 150-240, rendering the gauge useless in the event of overheating as it gives you no time to pull over before you cook the head gasket and warp the heads.",mercedes_benz

"Go to the dealership service department (or call them) and book an appointment to have the car looked at. It's literally highlighted in bold text in the second last paragraph. 

They'll take the car in, check it out, and if there is a problem with the recalled component, they'll fix it. If not, they'll let you know that it's all good but if something does happen, you should call them back and they'll fix it free of charge. They might want to perform a follow up inspection down the line too. 

They'll ask for your VIN to confirm whether your car falls under the recall notice, so have that handy. If you've never had your car looked at by their service department they'll also ask for your email and phone #. They'll use these to contact you for appointment confirmations and to let you know the car is ready. 

If the recall is mechanical they'll ask you to also call Mercedes roadside assistance so they can tow your car (as it would not be safe to drive there yourself). I had to do that for my GL450 a couple of years ago since the recall was related to the brakes, but I received no such advice for my E Class since the recall for that car is for the sunroof mechanism.

Not married = good thing. 

At age 20, car really is everything and probably the only thing. 

But guess what, it's really nothing once you have it. I've had all kinds of supercars and regular cars. 

Once you finally have what you want, it's meaningless. Just stress because you have to take care of it and it burns your money, unless of course you get something that rises in value. 

So, if you think you can just go out and buy the car you want, then do it. But don't regret it down the road. Because you will regret it when trying to get rid of it later. 

You'll get nothing but disappointment and regrets when they offer you $5,000-$8,000 for that CLA.

BMW, Audi, and Lexus have also all lowered the barrier of entry in order to capture more market share.

The entry-level offerings from all of these marques are laughably terrible. BUT -

I do see how their strategy is laid out. It‚Äôs intended to get younger consumer locked into their brand at an early stage, so that the carmaker can upsell them into pricier models as they get older and grow deeper pockets.

If you can get a 21-year old into a CLA, the hope is that with every salary increase, they graduate to a C-Class, then an E-Class, and hopefully into a top trim AMG high-performance model. That‚Äôs where all the margin lies.",mercedes_benz

"It's almost impossible to find a manual version of either car in Canada regardless of body style. Most of the manual Mercedes' for sale in Canada are either SLK, C Class, or super old. It's a little easier to find manual BMW's but most of them are either older than what you're looking for, base model E60 that aren't well equipped, or sports cars. Manual + Audi A6 is literally impossible. 

In any case, and this will obviously look biased as shit given the sub we're in, but I'd personally go for the Mercedes. It's the most reliable of the 3, the most comfortable, and if you get a V8, they haul ass too. 

>Any common issues or reliability tips for these models?

The E350 has balance shaft issues or something along those lines. 

If you get a car with air suspension, this is a common and expensive maintenance item. If you want ultimate relatively low cost long term car, get an E Class without air suspension. 

For pre 2005 cars rust will also be something to look out for, ESPECIALLY if you're in Quebec. Prevent by rustproofing every year before winter and/or washing it as frequently as you possibly can in the winter. 

W211s also have a brake by wire system (SBC) that is famously very expensive to fix and a bit of a coin toss in terms of reliability (I haven't personally had a single issue with mine, but like I said, it's a coin toss). Mercedes Canada officially has a 15 year unlimited mileage warranty for this particular component so it's something to look out for when shopping (some dealerships do honour Mercedes USA's 25 year warranty out of good faith, but this is a coin toss too). 

>Recommendations for the most reliable or enjoyable engines/trims?

V8s are the most enjoyable. Go for an E500/550 with the M113 5.5 litre V8. Reliable engine, reliable transmission. Air suspension is the only thing to look out for. 

A late model E320 with the M112 V6 will be the a good balance of reliable, inexpensive, and decently fun to drive. I always have a good time with mine. Also very fuel efficient. 

>Key things to check in the service history or maintenance?

SBC. Airmatic suspension. Rust. Those are your 3 main things with the W211 E Class. Add balance shaft if you're looking at an E350.",mercedes_benz

Mercedes has simply gone cheap (in quality, not price), and that‚Äôs unfortunate. The much ballyhooed S class has a Tesla-like tablet in lieu of a center console, and I guarantee you that the new S class will have a plethora of problems in a couple years.

Benz has gone so cheap that even the top of the line maybach S class has ‚Äúhaptic surfaces‚Äù instead of buttons now in the steering wheel, imagine the level of cost cutting.

The front page of this subreddit has a few posts talking about how terrible the w220 s class was reliability wise. It was legendarily bad.¬†

This is not the fault of the C class.¬†

One last thought, Mercedes is not on the level of Bentley and Rolls. To be in that level the brand would have to *start* at the S class. That leaves the E class, GLS, GLE, GLC, and every other car under the S class out, in other words, 99% of its lineup.¬†

The CLA is the Dollar General version of Mercedes Benz. The C300 is what I consider the only true entry to a luxury vehicle.

"""Made by Mercedes"" is absolutely not the same as a Mercedes branded automobile built to the same standards Mercedes is known for.

We own a couple of Mercedes-Benz cars, an S class and an E class wagon, they share a lot of similarities in spite of being built 10 years apart. The fit and finish, the materials used and the features are dramatically different than a Smart.

Smart's are built for a *very* different purpose than Mercedes are. They are ""city cars"", built to take up little space and be very easy to park in tight spaces. Smarts are also built to a *much* lower price point than M-B. They are absolutely not as ""nice"", not as luxurious, not as powerful. 

There are many times the Smart is our car of choice. We drive it for many of our quick trips to nearby destinations. It is *always* our choice for the rare occasions we are going when parking is tight.  It the most easy-to-drive car we have. As such, it is the one someone who doesn't drive one of the others will borrow.

Some people who buy a Smart may do so only because they are cheap. I don't doubt that many of them are poorly maintained and have given the owners trouble, but it has been great with nothing but normal maintenance and replacing wear items.

"I‚Äôve owned a few BMW‚Äôs and AMG‚Äôs
Had an M235i and M2 comp for some years, and had a few AMG‚Äôs including a C43 and C63s

I‚Äôd say it depends on what you‚Äôre looking for.

Personally, i prefer a BMW M car over an AMG, for the pure driving, grip, the way it feels on the road etc.
But the AMG wins on brutallity and sound - the BMW 3L i6 is amazing, but when it comes to the exhaust, the AMG is .. not even a question.

Although my M235i with a muffler delete and a tune was obnoxiously loud and popped like two canons going off at the same time.
 Bmw‚Äôs (in my experience) were the faster and better overall cars.
AMG has so much.. extra and plastic in the cabin that creeks etc.. car is amazing but it felt like the BMW‚Äôs were more ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and better put together.",mercedes_benz

They change our lifestyle. Waiting in chargers queues, waiting so long for the car to charge, being absolutely stuck if you run out of charge‚Ä¶

Hyundai has especially upped their styling, and even the base Elantra looks luxurious.

Don't get me wrong here, Mercedes cars do look great and have all the tech/comfort you'd want, but you're going to come across some problems later (a.k.a, not the most reliable for the price). I'm not saying Mercedes aren't reliable at all, but it all comes down to the price of fixing said issue. German cars will always be the most expensive to maintain and fix, so maybe that might not be something you'd want to deal with later. I might as well add this in; maybe even look at electric cars such as the Tesla Model 3. Those are fairly priced, and Tesla chargers are nearly everywhere now. Of course, if you don't like electric or want more range, just stick with a gas vehicle. All in all, just choose what you think is best for you given your circumstances and personal preference.

"(LONG RESPONSE!)

TL;DR: if money is a concern for you, I would recommend getting a Lexus or Acura rather than a Benz, as you‚Äôre likely going to spend less on maintenance on the two Japanese brands over the German one. Test drive whatever cars you are interested in as well.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know it may seem tempting to buy one of these cars cause they are very beautiful (especially the C300, as I‚Äôve never personally liked the A-class cars including the CLA). However there are some very important things you should consider before buying one of these cars or any other car. 

If you have just graduated (whether it be from high school, college or university) I think it‚Äôs best to be careful with what car you buy so as to avoid buying a car that ends up costing you thousands in repairs, due to it being poor in the reliability department. 

Personally, I have never owned either of these cars before, however, I have heard from many people online on forums and YouTube saying that Mercedes cars are not built like they were in the past. Now since this is not my own experience, I cannot confirm nor deny that these are true, just as a heads up. But I‚Äôve heard stories of old Benz cars lasting several hundred thousand miles without problems, but these days that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case with them. In an effort to cut costs, like many other brands, they have decided to use cheaper parts that break easier. To contrast this point, the same can be said for other brands too. A great example is Toyota/Lexus. I, like many others, absolutely love and would recommend Toyota/Lexus, but even I, and many other fans of these brands, can see that their cars have dipped in reliability, just not as bad as say Mercedes, for example, in my opinion. 

My main point here is that the car that you buy, in my opinion, should be fairly reliable. I totally understand if a Mercedes is your dream car and regardless of its cost of ownership you would love to own it. But IF (and only if) money is a concern for you, be careful with which car you end up buying. I guess if you have a really good mechanic then you should be fine too, and if your car is new and under warranty, you won‚Äôt have to pay (I‚Äôm pretty sure). Only thing is that if you do get a product that keeps having issues, you‚Äôll likely be out of your car for more time than you‚Äôll be inside it which can get pretty hectic and annoying.

Personally, I would say that if you just want a balanced luxury car, go with a Lexus. By balanced I mean luxurious interior and exterior (panel alignment/gaps, materials used, etc‚Ä¶), smooth and refined ride quality, and the best luxury, reliability. If it‚Äôs a C300 you want then I think your best bet for the Lexus equivalent would be between the IS or ES. There‚Äôs no model between them so you‚Äôd have to decide which one works better (IS is a compact, ES is a midsize). If you‚Äôd like to get the CLA250, then the Lexus equivalent would be the IS.

Sorry about the length of my response üòì but I truly want to ensure that you get the car that is right for you and one that you won‚Äôt regret purchasing later on, whether it be because you find it was not worth it, or that it is just not your type of car. If you think you can handle the maintenance costs of Mercedes, go for it. If you still want luxury while getting one the more reliable badges out there, though, I would go with Lexus. 

Last thing; test drive each of the cars you are looking at and do your research on features to make sure everything you want is in there (if this is a concern for you). Definitely drive each one and sit inside though, to make sure everything is according to your taste.

Regardless of which car you buy, I wish you luck in your shopping and I hope you find the car that‚Äôs right for you :)",mercedes_benz

A lot of it is from F1 racing. While that sounds good in theory the issue is that F1 teams are completely tearing down and rebuilding their engines after every race.

I will never understand buying a car and being scared to drive it for its intended purpose, I bought luxury so I drive it like a car. What is the point of buying a car and then having to buy another car so as not to wear and tear the car you really wanted?

I guess its also a question of depreciating assets and how slowly you want them to depreciate, but then do you ever enjoy the car if you are only seeing money and not the great joy of driving them?

MB new cars are over-complicated appliances with super complicated systems. They decided to go Tesla on everything and now they are rated close to last place in just about all consumer related rankings. AMG models are even worse since they have additional tech required to increase output while keeping emissions low.

All they have left is to leverage the legacy of a brand that was at one time the finest auto in the world.,mercedes_benz

Technically you can do it for really cheap if you know what you are doing, those reader things you can probably buy from China, for cheap.
The case and the PCB.

Your best bet is to find someone independent who already had experience with making a few keys, there's no point in going to the dealer for that. 

I guess, depending on where you live, it could cost anywhere under 100$ and probably maximum to 200/250$ WHICH is a lot. So probably anywhere around 100ish.

"If you want to drive newer cars, then definitely. The only models that hold up in terms of quality now are the handmade S classes (Maybach and Guard). Even the regular S classes are poorly made! And the EQS... I won't even talk about it.

The decline in quality started with the W220, got better with the 221, then declined a bit with the W222 and the W223 is just abysmal. For me, the last quality S-Class is the W221. It's got all the features one could need, you can drive without touching the pedals if you've got Distronic. It's got real leather, not Artico bullshit. It's got enough screen for proper, legible navigation and multimedia (just needs the CP/AA box). It's the most comfortable car under 10k. Plus it's reliable as hell if you maintain it, and not a huge pain in the ass to work on. People always either want 10 TVs in their car or no electronics at all, for me the W221 is the perfect equilibrium between the two. Just enough electronics to tell you exactly where the problems are so you don't have to spend days diagnosing, but not so many that it's distracting. That's a car I'll keep for life because they won't make another like it.",mercedes_benz

C300 is a beautiful sedan and after the W205 face-lift and onwards they gave the engine a bump in HP to 255Hp so its faster.


CLA is a beautiful car, they made it to look like a coupe after the new model that came out in 2020 they also bumped up the HP to 221 so it'll be a bit slower.

Overall both are beautiful cars, the C300 will have more features since it is higher in the lineup as people consider the CLA to be like one of the entry level Mercedes. Pick whichever you're more comfortable in.

"In the big picture, I don't disagree, but we know nothing about this person. Having put myself through college way back when that was possible (1970's), a new C300 seems a bit of a splurge, but OTOH, what if it is a gift? That's my guess. I have had three C300's, a 2012 (last of the good ones), a 2015 and a 2016 - all leases as I worked at an MB store. I never had any issues with any of them during the 3 years I had with the 2012 - later bought out and eventually sold to my best friend, the 2 years with the 2015, and three years with the 2016. Admittedly, all were under warranty while I owned them, but still, no issues with any of the three over 7 years? Now my wife has a 2022 GLC300 which replaced her 2019. No issues with either of them. I don't know. I had a 2002 E430 which was one of the last of the ""real"" E class cars before they ""thinned"" them out for the 2003 model year. The 02 was a fantastic car, engineered in a way that they don't allow anymore. The issues I had were so minor and to not be worth mentioning - I had a head rest that wouldn't go up and down anymore. So what? It died at the height I wanted it to. I had to replace a gasket for the transfer case. I paid my Master Mechanic $150 off the books to fix it. That's just about it. Of course, I kept the services up. 

MB's are very good cars. If you have the opportunity to go to Germany for any reason, you can certainly go to the factory for a tour, but just being there will give you a feel for their work ethic and how seriously they take just about everything.

"Story time, baby

I found this one a few years back. I wasn't looking for a 208 initially, but I always had a soft spot since the '02 CLK320 cab my mom bought in 2004. I was only 9 and was literally jumping like an idiot when i saw the roof go down at the dealer. Learned to drive with this car and basically shared it with my mom for several years until I got a C320 coupe. Learned to fix Mercedes with it at 16 with nothing but Google and some light autism.

I was looking for a 2011 E550 or C350 back in 2019 after someone smashed into my coupe... Then this guy showed up selling a black on black CLK430 COUPE WITH NO RUST for only 7k CAD with only 140,000 KMs. In fucking CANADA. IM IN THE RUST BELT.

I was so fucking erect.

Dropped my search for every other car, went over to this guy and brought my jack. It was PERFECT. Everything worked perfectly. Underside was clean. Transmission serviced, AC just fixed with warranty.

No idea why no one wanted the car, but I immediately offered him his ask (7k) as a 430/208 that was kept this well was impossible to find for less than 10k as mostly collectors had them. Really didn't want to screw the guy too bad as he only had it for a year after importing it from British Columbia. He paid 11k on the receipt i saw.

Do i feel bad for dailying it? Nope. Drives like a dream and I wrench it myself because I literally don't trust anyone else with doing the work correctly or taking their time. I have rust spots beginning to form but theyre being taken care of professionally. Eventually. Cousin owns a shop and we're looking for good panels but they aren't easy to find online.

"It's VERY boaty to drive. My least favourite parts about driving the S Class are accelerating and braking. It's just too much body movement for my liking. I will concede though that mashing the foot down for maximum launch is enjoyable, but in normal driving, the car definitely heaves and takes a second or two to get moving when the lights go green (unless, again, you mash the throttle, but then that just kinda feels wrong). In that way it's very similar to driving a large 3 row SUV. Also wider turns, as already mentioned. 

Once you're up to speed though, it's probably the nicest thing you can ever be in on the affordable end of a Rolls Royce. There are moments where the only way I even knew I was in a moving car was by the visual input of everything else moving around me.

lol what? The amg has a hand built longitudinal engine that is entirely different platform with hybrid and electric tech. The c300 is the mainstay MB 2.0l. They are entirely different engines and platforms. They are not even built in the same place. The amg 2.0L turbo is also hand assembled by one tech.,mercedes_benz
"I know the cost but I just wanted OP to know that if s/he has to pay for maintenance they may want to consider the cost. It's just budgeting advice and any recent grad should start thinking about it now so they can become financially successful enough to buy their own AMG in the future and not worry at all about the maintenance costs like you and me. 

Just an example, I just spent $950 for service B and got a new set of winter tires for next season because they had a promo of buy 3 get the 4th for $1 (so I ended up paying $2200 instead of $3000... Killer deal if anyone needs new shoes, promo ends today @ www.mbusatirecenter.com) but my spend for the week was over $3k for my car but it could have been $4k. The car has the star and so we all pay a premium because of it.

I could name a bunch of alternative choices, still fun to drive, very reliable, and much cheaper to maintain but what's the point? Only the OP knows what they want.",mercedes_benz

"Please don‚Äôt listen to any of these comments telling you to get a lawyer. First contact Benz customer care. They have an in house team that reviews your request in accordance with lemon law in your state. If you don‚Äôt get anywhere with that, then look into a legal case. Save your money and try to work it out with the company.

Your case for lemon law is already pretty thin unless you live in California which has strict consumer laws. Unlikely you would win but doesn‚Äôt hurt to try. I would consider a trade assist or bring up the idea of a trade assist to the dealer also.

Also A-class is the worst car that Benz makes, I would have done a lot more research before buying that car because a quick google search would‚Äôve shown the vast amount of problems that model has.

"Obviously with the caveat that all of these cars are getting quite old now, and most W202s are newer than W124s... the W202 is like a transition to the full compromise of engineering standards that used to define MB (and you saw with the W203).

Mechanically still generally excellent, but durability took a hit and many of them rust horribly too. I don't view them the way I view W124s and W201s, but the W202 is much more underrated so more of a bargain. W124s are quickly thinning out into good ones and total wrecks and you don't want to go near the latter unless you know what you're doing (and even then probably not unless it's a rare model).",mercedes_benz

"I got a new set myself on Saturday. A little annoyed, some were made in December 2022. I could have awaited new tires, but settled on a manager special of $50 off per tire. When I buy new, I expect to get fresh tires. All is good, car drives great. I do love these.",mercedes_benz
