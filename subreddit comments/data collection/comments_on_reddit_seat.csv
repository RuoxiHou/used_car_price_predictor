A lot of the hybrid tech is mild, and doesn't need you to charge the car.",seat
"If you're lucky and it cranks it *might* be salvageable. If not, that's good night Irene, engine's kaput. Red oil light, especially on a diesel is bad news, either low pressure or running dry. Worst case scenario, new engine and turbo. Best case scenario, rebuild engine and recondition turbo.

Sticky throttle is unrelated, probably something wrong at the pedal

For future reference, check oil level, orange dipstick under the bonnet, every so often when the car is cold.",seat

"Thermostat should not fail closed, but everything is possible. Get it checked by reputable shop that knows VWs. It's 16 years old car so things can and for sure will fail at some point. Your car luckily does not have silica bag in the reservoir to cause harm.

"You should have an opf or dpf, depending if it’s gasoline or diesel, try going to some repair shop with a good tester, and ask them to tell you wether it is clogged, that could increase fuel consumption

"In what ways specifically?

About 7 to 8 thousand euros (plus a bit additional left for potential fixes,etc.), but prices are wildly different from country to country, so for that money here in the Balkans I can get the Leon 3, 8P or the Golf 6 from the VAG hatch segment and that's about it. Golf 7 starts at 9k in the worst trims and states or 11+ for a decent one in the same trim/state that a Leon goes for 7-8.

There are other brands like Peugeot and Ford which are cheaper than VW and maybe even Seat, but honestly I don't like them despite that maybe being a more rational choice, I have an old Seat Arosa now which never gave me any trouble, so I'd like to stay with Seat or at least within the group.",seat

">according to the manual - there's a ""driving mode"" button near the shift stick that allows to change the mode.

>alas - I don't have that in my car whatsoever.

I take that your car has an automatic transmission, right?

With a standard gearbox you are responsible of the ""driving modes"" and the computer only tells you the consumption results of your driving, some cars also give you suggestions on when to make the gear changes to keep the fuel usage in check.

Maybe I'm miss understanding you.",seat

"Mpi and Tsi are just systems of different types. Mpi stands for multi point injection and was mostly used on older VW cars. Tsi engines use direct injection which requires higher fuel pressure.

"Aw darn :(. Thanks for the help man, I really appreciate it. So basically all these companies selling big brake kits (Racingline Forge etc) for 6F Ibizas are full of s**t and never actually tested fitting them? They claim they are direct bolt on kits 

Still wondering if there is a solution for the overheating. Would higher temp rated pads and cross drilled or grooved rotors help at all? The total disc volume would be close to the same so I assume it wouldn't help a whole lot?

I'm also thinking the main culprit is the XDS, because the side that caught fire was the right side, on a clockwise track, and I was trail braking quite a lot. I'm thinking it was activating the front inner wheel brake a lot both when braking and powering out of the corner. Any idea how to turn off XDS? Couldn't figure it out with VCDS as the brake/abs module was locked and it wanted me to input an access code. The car is a 2022 FR 1.5. I realize it's not exactly a track car but I like to hoon it every now and then",seat
"Having owned 2 Cupra's I'd go Cupra but beware the Cupra is only front wheel driver and can suffer from some horrendous wheel hop.

The tech in your car is much better at calculating whats best for fuel consumption than you Are. Unless you know that youll be driving in the city for an extended amount of time, put it in hybrid and let it do its thing. No point in having the ICE work overtime to charge your HV battery to 50%+ while driving.

I have exactly that configuration in my 2020 sportstourer. I’ve had the car for 2 years now and it has 45k km and the gear has been without fault so far. I like how seemless the mild hybrid system works with the auto gearbox. Really smooth. My only slight minus point would be how the car engine brakes going from 3rd to 2nd gear. Under light braking it can sometimes make things feel a bit jerky as the gearbox is setup to engine brake slightly more aggressively in 2nd gear. Not a huge deal though in the grand scheme of things. The 7speed dsg has been on the market for a long time now so I would assume all teething issues are been resolved. It’s also not a very high torque drivetrain so the overall load on the gearbox isn’t out of the ordinary.,seat

"Outside of looks and insurance, the big difference is AWD vs. FWD. The golf is faster. 

I went from an Octavia vRS with 220bhp, to a golf R. Even the vRS struggled to get it's power down in first gear, just scrambled for grip and you get some torque steer, whereas the R just goes. 

So, if you want to go fast off the line, get the R, otherwise, I'd get the Cupra.

Your other option in that price range is the Cupra 300 estate, that's AWD also. I think the estates look great, but that's subjective.",seat

"I was able to install a cheap (~ €300 for headunit + 360 cameras + USB dashcam) on my Seat Leon ST 2018.

Most of the cheap headunits don't come with Android 12. Even though many of them say they do, that is not usually true, they just change the system properties to show 12 instead of 10 and underlying OS stays the same.

Car settings seems to work. Wheel controls are supported out of the box. The communication with the car is done using CanBus.

The Android application allows changing car model and depending on what car model you choose, more settings become available even though most of them are not relevant to my car.

I don't really need car settings though since most of that info is available from the dashboard (like fuel consumption). The thing that is not available in the dashboard is resetting tyre pressure sensors. I wasn't able to verify if tyre pressure reset works on headunit since my sensors haven't triggered yet.

"Here’s everything we are aware of from owning a 2.0L 184 estate.

(think it’s a 190 version but not sure.)

Common for water-pump to crack (known issue)

Don’t switch the engine off as soon as you get home (it gets very hot in that bay, give it a min too cool down, more if you ragged it)

DSG Gearbox has a maintenance window also. Where the oil has to be changed.

DSG Gearbox can feel clunky when first turned on will settle once it’s warm, be nice and let the revs settle after turning it on before moving it. Otherwise car has tendency to lurch forwards. 

Also be nice and wait for car to be at a complete stop between switching from reverse and forward. This we noticed the lurching was worse if we kept doing this. Now we wait for a complete stop before changing between these. When warm it’s not as bad.

When I drive it I always leave start stop off, had a small issue with performance that was due start stop and carbon build up. So I just leave it off now.

Also it’s not great if you come off a motorway after thrashing it and it turns the engine off and it gets warm. Think that’s why the thermostat housing / water-pump housing cracks.

Only small thing I noticed, is a small bit of rust on the back right chassis frame. Nothing major just it’s started to rust already.

We reckon 5 or so years for a cam-belt to be honest, as long as it’s not shredded it’s not a problem. But it’s not worth the hassle of it snapping as that’s a new engine.

Oh and brakes will wear more quickly as it’s a DSG, compared to a manual but it’s not huge just be sensible about it really.

What I may do soon, though, is to swap the stock 215/45 R17 Nexen Blue HD Plus tyres for something nicer when they start to show a bit more wear, probably either Goodyear F1 Eagle Asymmetric 6s or Michelin Pilot Sport 5s, which should improve both handling/grip and braking distances in both wet and dry.",seat

"Yes, essentially it is part of ESP programming, this is what VW said when it released XDS back when the Mk6 GTI came out:

""Sportier and safer with XDS:
For the first time in a Volkswagen, the XDS electronic transverse differential lock is being used. It significantly improves traction and handling properties. Tech­nically speaking, XDS is a functional extension of the electronic limited-slip differential (EDS) integrated in the ESP system.
In fast curve driving, as soon as the innovative electronics detects that the wheel at the inside of the curve on the GTI’s driven front axle is insufficiently loaded, the ESP hydraulics specifically builds up braking pressure at this wheel to restore optimal traction. So XDS acts as a type of transverse differential lock that compensates for the understeering that is typical on front-wheel drive vehicles when driving fast through curves.”

But then they made it all confusing because they also integrated it with the the VAQ diff and called that XDS+.",seat

It's just the regular FR model, not the FR Sport, though they're exactly the same mechanically, I just don't have the digital cockpit, alcantara seats or 18"" laser- cut alloys. It's an early post-facelift model, so has the sharper interior, nicer alloys and the new infotainment screen, have just patched the firmware of the latter to 0870, so that's pretty up-to-date now 

Thinking of putting some nicer tyres on it, such as Michelin Pilot Sport 5s or Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric 6s, instead of the mediocre 215/45 R17 Nexen Blue HD Plus tyres it has on now, which should further improve the handling and braking distances (especially in the wet).

- if you thrash it (which you will lol) it will drink fuel, which is expected. Anyways enough about fuel lol 

- the power is absolutely relentless, it’s faster then S3, golf r, ml35i. You just don’t have 4 wheel drive that’s why it’s quicker. 

- you will get wheel hop if you are launching it and full throttling off the line but I would recommend getting a Powerflex lower engine mount insert(£40) takes 10 mins to fit in and will remove the wheel hop

Mine is not the FR **Sport** version, but other than not having the digital cockpit, alcantara seats and having 17"" powder coated alloys instead of 18"" laser cut ones, is exactly the same as the FR Sport.

I got the custom order and got the car in 3 months. Had some paper issues so they had the car in the saloon for a month. PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANTED TO PAY MORE THAN I DID BECAUSE IT LOOKED SO GOOD!

When we came to the saloon to bring all paperwork and see when we will pick it up, 2 couples were looking at it. One with a family, they liked it but it was not for them and the others wanted it but sadly needed a car now and could not buy mine so they got some from the offer. And the cars that were offered were black, gray and white. No red, no blue.

"I have the Leon 1.5 eTsi with the 7 speed dsg. It’s the DQ200 which has a dry clutch pack. It’s not the strongest dsg out there but it can handle up to 250nm which is what the 1.5 produces. Yes it wears faster then the wet clutch packs but that depends a lot on your driving style. Creeping forward in traffic for example creates a lot of slip and heat because it can’t fully engage, causing excessive wear. Also stop and go traffic causes more wear then highway miles.
I also had the DQ200 on my 1.4 ACT from 2015. 100k km, no issues at all. If you buy a used car there are 2 ways to tell if the dsg is okay. 1) drive it and feel if it’s shifting smooth from even to odd gears under a bit of load or slightly uphill. Check if it throws it’s rpm’s up before engaging a next gear. 2) I have been told by a mechanic there is a diagnostic sensor measuring if the clutchpack is worn yet.

As others say, the smoothness of driving away in the 1.5 etsi with dsg is brilliant. In D it doesn’t tell which gear it is in. I tried counting without looking at rpm’s, couldn’t figure it out, that’s how smooth.

I’m not 100% sure about this theory but I think the DQ200 should wear less with the mild hybrid system. Because of the greater torque at lower rpm’s it should be able to fully engage faster. Causing less slip.

Also, remember most people on the internet will only take the time to write about bad experiences they had so that will always be out of balance. (Not saying it can’t happen to you)",seat
"I got T10 version from aliexpress. <link omitted> The rest of the items I got from the same seller. You can message them and they will tell you what works with this headunit.

There is an option to do tyre pressure reset both in the headunit and  OBD. If it does not work from the headunit I am sure I can find it using OBD.

The biggest challenge for me was fitting the headunit because I have a right hand side wheel and none of the headunits provide a frame for that.

With modern traffic/speed limits and enforcements, all these cars would have been plenty without, but it wasn’t the peak power I’ve chased in any of them.

I suspect you are probably not doing enough daily mileage and this is making life difficult for the DPF to do passive regenerations. I can get really deep into this topic but sadly I think you are stuck with this.
The reason you’re oil level increases is because every time a passive regeneration gets aborted, a quantity of diesel fuel gets past the piston rings and into the sump, diesel fuel mixes well with engine oil but it once it happens it does thin down the oil. Reducing the oil level isn’t the right fix. It should have an oil and filter change",seat

"Ah, I'm in the UK, so maybe different here regarding the specs and infotainment system configuration. Also I think all non-""Sport"" Ibiza FRs here have analog dials, you only get the digital cockpit in the FR Sport and some of the Excellence models. My regular FR has the analog dials, and 17"" alloys, rather than 18"", and fabric seats rather than alcantara. It's exactly the same mechanically as the FR Sport, though. I have a 6 speed manual 110PS /81Kw FR model (they seem to have increased the engine power a little in the 2024 model).

They don’t seem as keen to rectify issues, they noticed my rear shocks were leaking oil, and because it’s only ‘misting’ - they won’t replace them under warranty & expect me to pay £700 to repair them?
Baffles me how shock absorbers would be leaking oil on a car with 25k miles & that not be a manufacturer issue. 

Cars going in for a major service & MOT next month so I’ll update this then - hopefully they decide to do the jobs I need doing under warranty

Teyes headunits are more expensive I believe and their cameras are probably better than what I have.

Regarding annoying bugs - nothing major, the headunit seem to work pretty ok. Several things that I experienced:

* I tried to set up tasker automation scripts to do different action on wheel key presses and tasker was always being killed. Took me a while to find a hidden setting that whitelists tasker from being killed.

"2 main issues with the 1.4tsi

Most common and worst is that the bolts for the cover for your exhaust camshaft adjuster isnt treated with loctite, causing Them to back out, damaging the adjuster, leaking out your oil onto the timing belt and potentially starving your engine of oil. Changing the adjuster along with your timing belt is generally a 3.5 hour job, but then timing the engine correctly requires a 4k usd oem tool and takes another 3 hours. 

The second common issue is that the injectors back out, warping your fuel rail and breaking the bolts for it, so you need to reseal injectors and a New fuel rail. This is a manifold off kinda job so takes a few hours of labor aswell.",seat

"My 2016 Leon has Full Link that gives you access to Android Auto, Apple Car Play and MirrorLink. As far as I understand MirrorLink is for those who don't have an Android or Iphone.",seat
"Mark my words, next to remapping your ecu, i bet there's a way to disable that system via software programming. If they can unlock hidden feautures then they will absolutely be able to do that too.",seat
Cool! Must be software then. Thanks for your answer.,seat
"That's not something I've noticed but maybe, not laggy in a way that bothers me.
A tip if you didn't know about it, if you tap both cold and warm you start the seat warmer ;)",seat
What is the problem you are having? Codes are only half the story.,seat
"I have a towbar on my Leon, from 2020 MK3. 

Do you want a picture, can PM you?",seat
"Take it to a new mechanic, this one's clearly a muppet.",seat
"got it thank you, i couldnt see the join in the light so i couldnt see how the panel came off, but sorted now, will check the fuses and hope its just that, thanks again",seat
AC max sets the temperature to Low and maximum fan speed.,seat
"There isn't one... wired directly to the Central Electrics control unit ""BCM"", won't be a fuse either because both headlights share the same fuse

I'd double check the light bulb is the correct one and is fitted correctly, then check with a voltmeter and see if there's voltage at the bulb when the lights are supposed to be on, live against a known good earth and earth against a known good live

If there's no live, then you'll need to check at the wiring junction inside the car and then at the BCM (at this point I'd recommend taking the car to a SEAT/VAG specialist)

If there's no earth, chances are it's the headlight, since there's only 1 earth wire at the plug for all the lights and gets split for each bulb inside the headlight, if only the dip beam doesn't work and it's a bad earth, that only leaves the headlight itself


Just make sure the bulb is the correct one and is fitted correctly, number of times had cars come in from other mechanics condemning the BCM when the bulb isn't sitting right...  it's actually scary...",seat
You would use the AC Max if your windows suddenly fogged up. The lower button is just air conditioning. How ever if you use the middle dial on auto and set the required temp it’s much nicer. Also I read recently that you get best economy if you keep the air on recirculate mode and engage A/C. I’ve noticed when I’ve been in Australia that recirculate is the default setting.,seat
"i always drive on normal mode, i tried going into eco mode and drove for 5 minutes but it was behaving the same way so i just switched back to normal but nothing has changed. I wonder what the issue could be?",seat
Check for cables under the accelerator pedal or handbrake release,seat
"yeah, and what happens after those years",seat
The parking brake also disengages automatically with it off. The two are completely separate systems. Like I said: auto hold utilizes the ABS system.,seat
Danggggg gotta do this!,seat
"Hard to say, the price of mk4 Leon’s fell a lot though, I bought my 2021 for 21k just over a year ago and it’s now worth 16k 🥲",seat
The mk3.5 do come with Copper S as standard. But i actually really like the new badge so i did the same with mine!,seat
Definitely would like to know what the fuel economy is like when just driving normally?,seat
Surely that just means the number below is your fuel economy figure? I don't think your car has driving modes..,seat
Thanks a lot. I appreciate it,seat
"I don't like seeing the rusty discs (is this a mk3 leon/st thing or just because I look at these more), so would go for the more obscured black ones.",seat
I have a Leon 12/18 with MIB 2 and my car only show the Bluetooth Logo.,seat
"Thaks a lot man, worked!! You saved me lot of time",seat
"i don’t know too much about cars but why’s it trying to get me to shift up at those rpm? and it’s not just hills, it happened on normal flat roads too",seat
"I think the Corolla would ve rhe more realible option since, well it's a Toyota ;)",seat
Thanks so much mate! I'll look into it :),seat
"Looks like you are in Ireland. The van has white euro plate on the back. Me too. 

I have the same car. If it only has one SD slot in the glove box and your head unit system has a code like something below. 

MST2_EU_SE_ZR_P0351T very tipical for non nav and Irish / UK market. 

Then it needs to be taken to the dealer, I was quoted 340€ for this, a rip off but doesn't surprise me here. Less than 200 in England for the same. 

I heard as well you can do it at home but you need to solder components to the back of the radio.",seat
"Thanks for letting me know, I was looking to buy the 1.5 Evo FR Black Leon and the dealership sent me a video, amazing looking I just thought damn that sounds like a diesel but I imagine they literally started up the car and took the video straight away without it warming up hence it being quite noisy",seat
"Hope so. I just got a new Ibiza and am really happy with it. It seems to be just about the only car on the market that fills the niche of a small-ish mid-range hatch at a medium pricepoint that has enough power you can drive it ""normally"" (the 115hp is the smallest sold in my country, not like some anaemic 60hp thing that struggles to merge or overtake), but isn't a hot-hatch boy-racer model.

I guess that's not what sells any more though, I guess most of the new-car-buying demographics want SUVs and crossovers if they're not looking for an enthusiast/premium type car or an EV.",seat
"Going to try and get a test drive this weekend as that’s the only way to really see, was yours 150bhp also?",seat
"Yh I’m seeing quotes for like £500 for a retro fit, I just want to use Waze lol, the nav on the original display is terrible",seat
"try long pressing the power button on the infotainment and keep pressing until it reboots. then just reconnect your phone with a cable. I find that helpful when carplay won't connect in my Leon.

or your phone didn't give needed permissions. try forgetting the car in phone settings and try again.",seat
"That I’m unsure about, I’m guessing you wouldn’t be able to. Only thing thst I could think of is having it set to what you need, or reset on OBD any flags",seat
https://www.seat.com/car-terms/x/xds,seat
"Ok, thanks for help.",seat
It's normal for them to come on shortly before you start the engine I wouldn't worry about it unless it stays light up,seat
"No. Theres a story. I bought the car with about 1000 miles on the clock. The franchise owner’s son had been allocated it as his demonstrator. So being the owners son he ordered it with every conceivable extra inc
full body skirt, twin split exhausts, black 18 inch wheels, It’s a petrol automatic and I think tuned. It’s only a 1.4 engine but will leave most cars standing. On top of that it delivered 60MPG on a run and 40 around town. I did change the tyres from Bridgestones to Goodyears which made a huge difference is MPG and Quietness. I wish I’d kept it. I have had loads of cars and this beats them all. A real eye catcher.",seat
"I guess you have the AS maps for the MIB2?

1. backup the card
2. if you have the 32GB Card: replace the content of \maps with the \maps from https://navigation-maps.volkswagen.com/vw-maps/DiscoverMedia2_EU-AS_2110_V18.7z
Else if you only have 16GB: use this (older Version V14) https://seatmapdownloads.akamaized.net/EUAS/EU_AS_STD_1520.zip
3. copy the OVERALL.DNS from you backup to \maps\EEC\EEC_WLD\ 
4. enjoy


Be carefull: if you lose your original OVERALL.NDS the card is useless!

no guarantee ;)

Anyone other than a Sunday driver would know the term idiot aid. ABS, traction control, torque vectoring are all idiot aids. It is literally an interfering idiot sitting between the driver and car.

Only thing I can do is pick up some better pads and rotors / brake fluid. Thinking of getting something from Tarox as I haven't found any available brembo products. Though I doubt it would improve overheating much, especially with the XDS constantly working. 

I couldn't even turn XDS off with VCDS as the module was locked. Hoping OBD11 might work.",seat

The engine is quiet. Ppl usually mention more noise from chassis. 

At idle my friend with 2.0 TDI 2012 audi a4 thought, the engine is off.

At 90-95km/h it's hard to hear.

At around 100km/h you can start to hear some deep ""hmmmmm"", but if you don't have fan (without AC) on lowest level and radio also on low volume, so you can talk comfortably, then it's hard to hear too.

The highway driving, so something like 130-140km/h was also ok. 

Ofc driving uphill in corners on 3rd up to 90km/h on straights it can be heard 😅

Bonus: When I was choosing it, it has lower RPM on highway than hyundai i30 (I think it was the 1.6 petrol) and it's quieter. Reviews said, the i30 is noisy.",seat

"I guess you have the AS maps for the MIB2?

1. backup the card
2. if you have the 32GB Card: replace the content of \maps with the \maps from https://navigation-maps.volkswagen.com/vw-maps/DiscoverMedia2_EU-AS_2110_V18.7z
Else if you only have 16GB: you have to find the older Version V14 somewhere. The link for it is dead.
3. copy the OVERALL.DNS from you backup to \maps\EEC\EEC_WLD\ 
4. enjoy


Be carefull: if you lose your original OVERALL.NDS the card is useless!

no guarantee ;)

"Yeahhh me too :(

Well as far as i know there are two ways.

The 1st way is in the menu under driver assistance - > speedwarning and then there are two options:

1. visual and audio ( default )
2. visual

If you know your way takes maybe 10 seconds.

2nd way is on your multifunctional steering wheel. There is a button on the left side to access the driver assistance quick and toggle off the speedwarning. Takes around 5 seconds i guess :)",seat
"I totally get where you're coming from with the Skoda Octavia vs. Seat Leon dilemma. Both are solid choices, but that transmission decision can be a tough nut to crack.

Here's my take: while there used to be some reliability concerns with the 7-speed DSG, things have improved significantly in recent years. I've been cruising around in a 2022 Leon Sportstourer with the 1.5 eTSI engine and automatic transmission for about a month now, and I've gotta say, I'm loving it. The automatic transmission is smooth as silk, and the driving experience is top-notch. Plus, the road feel on the Leon is just spot-on compared to the Octavia, which felt a bit too bouncy for my liking.

So, if you're leaning towards the automatic and the Leon is tickling your fancy, I'd say go for it. With the advancements in transmission tech these days, you can likely expect a reliable ride for years to come. And trust me, that smooth driving experience is worth it.",seat
