"Mine is insured through state farm.  The coverage is nothing special, but I don't really need it, and it's relatively cheap.


Hagerty is supposedly great coverage but terrible to get approved and insanely expensive.  They want you to have a lifetime of professional high speed driving with a perfect driving record, and then keep your car in a fireproof vault and not drive it, while charging you 3x.  I would rather just pay myself with the savings I have by not using them.",mclaren

"918. It's faster, you can take the roof off, more reliable, easier to use every day, and personally I find it better looking.

The P1, as great as it is, would terrify me to take out more than once a week. It would probably be more thrilling than the 918 on that one day, but I would be so afraid of it's fragility. Whereas the 918 will feel like a really special Turbo S or something. Valuable and special, but also approachable.

"I am not up with how much all the options cost, but that gold colour is pretty special. Very nice car and can definitely see why you have jumped on it.  D

It is safe to say that you are not going to have any real money issues, as long as you don't leverage yourself to hell with everything.  I can see that car putting a smile on your face everytime you see it in the garage or walk out from work for your drive home. You work hard, are not making horrible financial decisions, so you can safely buy this and enjoy it.

"My difficulty with Porsche isn't that they're not a great car or that the buyings experience is annoying (and I understand why people would think it is) My difficulty is that Porsche is a boring choice, Is it a great car absolutely! Is it probably one of the best engineered and driving cars at any price point, almost definitely.
Is it the car that every doctor and dentist and anyone who wants to be seen as someone who has ""made it"" buys and drives to and from their practice every day—It is.

I am an automotive enthusiast I have been since I was a little kid and I want something exciting. For me Porsche does not check that box.",mclaren

"So I think you are in a great position. Financially you have such high earning power, it won’t matter. I wouldn’t pay in cash, finance it and then decide if you want to pay it off immediately later on. Or you can refinance it for a lower rate when rates drop. More options if you use this method.

Mclarens will depreciate so just be prepared for that. Also, if it’s not under warranty, find a good euro shop to do servicing and repairs. Don’t go back to the dealer because it’s expensive and honestly takes forever for the service.

Keep in mind, as rates keep hanging high, the slower these cars are moving. If the stock market tumbles through Q3/4, people aren’t going to be buying. You have the leverage and upper hand here. This isn’t 2021, where cars flew off the lot. People are being squeezed and if the stock market gives up 7-10% in a correction, that’s when you go buy for the best prices.

That’s the perfect time to get back to shopping. I used Mcmedics to do my PPI and they are pretty good. I also bought from a non Mclaren dealer. This is because they don’t want to do the repairs or reconditioning so they’ll be more apt to negotiate with you. I got $5k off when I showed the minor issues my PPI turned up. 

Also, I would recommend you finance the car as part of the deal. This provides the dealer with more margins and thus willingness to negotiate further on the price. You can alway pay off the loan after 30 days or whatever. (Not ideal for the dealership since they lose their financing commission, don’t do this if you want to build a relationship with them) 

These cars generally aren’t moving off the lot fast so just be patient and don’t fall in love with a production car. I’m watching vehicles sit on the lot. The ones that are moving are priced well because dealers can’t sit on inventory paid in cash. 

Also, check back in with the dealer on that 650S, because deals fall through all the time. The dealer should not have sold it if you had a deposit hold for a PPI. Find a better dealer that doesn’t do shady shit like that. Paying slightly more but working with a better dealer can open you up for more allocation in the future on more rare models.

I recommend Lambo of Broward as they were patient with me and the PPI that was scheduled. I’m sure they got calls on the vehicle but it was held until the PPI was done. The dealer is part of a bigger group in Miami Florida. So in 2-3 years, I’ll come back for a huracan spyder. Then I’ll ask to be put on a list for allocation of a more rare new model.",mclaren

"Warranty work will be in Detroit. About $1500 to trailer up and back depending. Toy barn (and probably mag) can do service. But anything out of the ordinary they will just fuck around, not fix it and try to charge you an absurd hourly rate.

Could you please explain how please?,mclaren
Yeah I think some other brands need to have a bigger correction assuming more downturn at some point. Huracans are really overpriced to me. I traded one for the 720s. I could have kept it two more years and got a 720s now for the same trade in value but way cheaper 720s (bought in 2021). I’d never go back to a 580-2 huracan and the used technicas are practically over msrp. People fomo for the V10 but there were a lot of those V10s made in lambo and Audi. How many 3000lb carbon fiber cars with doors going up are there! I sold a viper ta to get in a huracan and the huracan to get in the 720s and the viper is damn near worth the 720s that I’d be able to just pay in cash for today haha.

"I have had 2 x 720s and a 991.2 and a 992 turbo s. 

No major issues with either 720 other than accumulators on the coupe. Spider had zero issues.  I was always nervous about taking them on long road trips and they generally feel fragile. 

Porsches I beat the piss out and drive in rain, sleet, snow, sun. They never miss a beat.

"The the other argument I hear about is the reliability of McLaren and the high maintenance cost versus Porsche. I believe the 911's and Boxster/Caymen are fairly predictable reliable , but the issue my friends have reported are if you are so unlucky to have an unexpected issue, it's like fighting a war to get warranty work because Porsche has a tendency to blame issues on the owner given its reliability record. And the other friends who went with an SUV or Taycan have had their fair share of reliability issues too and maintaince isn't exactly cheap either.

I do know that when I got my CPO, and had a minor issue with the control stock slightly sticking every so often  and not moving the menu item up every so often..McLaren and my dealer took care of it right away...drop shipped the control stock part overnight and replaced it the second day, under warranty .",mclaren

"As a 720s owner I’d say this is accurate. Though I will say that people may be surprised when the 720s doesn’t drop to 650s prices. Cars are getting too expensive as they move up in production costs and all the hybrid R&D. Even the 750s coupes are hitting nearly 400k and spiders going up to 490k and those don’t have hybrids. Next entry lambo will be way over the 250k of years past. I wouldn’t sell my 720s currently because there’s just no where to go with it. I’d have to go down back for the huracan I got out of when I traded “up” for the 720.  The 720s is a lot of people’s favorite super car when it came out. It was a benchmark car and I think will hold up well for those who keep one in their collection over the longer term. Lambo with the revuelto is now using full carbon chassis like the McLarens to offset weight of the hybrid system and that had a tremendous impact on price. The 296 is not exactly cheap either so again I just think the floor IS moving up and I’d be surprised if the 720 goes much further lower than 200 overall. I think other cars need a bigger price correction. With all that said a well sorted ideal spec and warrantied 720 is the way to go from most perspectives. The 750s is better and does have a fresh warranty and is deserving of its price. I’d try to get a 765lt instead personally just for the rarity since the car may only be held for a year or two.  The only car I think people can go to with marked performance improvements that will be felt would be a SF90 at 500k+. That’s why I’ll keep my 720s for better and worse for a long time just since it’s got the carbon chassis, 9.x 1/4 mile, doors that go up and great driving engagement on and off track.",mclaren

"Thanks for that! I am insanely jealous - I have only seen one F1, very briefly, going the opposite direction on a highway. I think it is amazing, the finest car ever made. Some day, I hope to somehow examine one as you did.

The T50 misses the point, to me. He has built the same car again, only not half as pretty. In the 21st century, it is a little crazy to me not to take advantage of at least some of the driver aids and ""update the F1"", so to speak. Why would you not have a twin clutch, paddle shift transmission? It was not a thing when the F1 was built, but it is state of the art today.

I think I read that the last F1 changed hands for 23 million dollars (American). If I had 24 million to my name, I wold have bought it.",mclaren

I got rid of gt3 and bought McLaren.  Tried a MB for about 3 months and got an AM. I still have the cayenne and panamera but I’m done with Porsche for awhile.  The situation left a VERY bad taste in my mouth.

"The Vantage is a front engine car, and I’m not sure of the weight distribution, but this combination is likely less compliant in real world situations than a mid-engine car like your McLaren.  All of these cars are maximizing power through forced air induction (turbo), and perhaps meeting regulatory changes as well.  The Vantage was turbo charged?

"Better looking is subjective, so I won't argue that. But I would want a car that I can enjoy whenever I want without worrying. Obviously odds are you'll have a daily, but being able to use the 918 3 or 4 times a week is way more appealing than using the P1 once a week and only when it's bone dry outside. 

Like I said, if I wanted to choose one to enjoy for a single weekend in California or on a dry track, I might choose the P1 just to see how brutal it is. But to own for a lifetime, the 918's mix of rawness and comfort is just right.",mclaren

"Well, as I said before, I can't say for other people...I was just a software engineer that retired recently in my 40ies... and it was a retirement gift to myself. Mid life crisis car ...just a few years earlier...😂..  I'm a single parent , and I'm sending my kid to college this fall. My kid will most likely go out of state since 16 of 20 schools she got into were out of state.. my estimate is it will cost about $300-400k. It's fine, my kids 529k college savings account and custodial account  that I worked hard to build is sufficient to pay for that in full and some left over so my kid won't have any student loans debt....

I was originally thinking about getting an Artura but decided to start with a CPO 570s first to see how I like it. I spent about $170k ish OTD for a Spyder including sales tax, registration , etc , and add another $7k for PPF clear bra. Probably a bit high and it wouldn't have been that much more for an Artura..but there wasn't a Spyder version at the time. (But now, hmmm ).... 

It was my early retirement present for myself , and I sold some stocks  to pay for it all and also moved some money into cash. Funny part is, in Jan, the stock market briefly reacted to unexpected inflation numbers and JPowell comment and the market briefly dipped and when it did I moved some money back into the markets. 2 months later, the investments pretty much already made back what I paid for the car,.that was an unexpected windfall. Thank you AI-hyped semiconductor sector and weight loss drug companies.

I've invested my money into the stock market since I was 18. And in my early 30ies, I took some of my money and bought real estate in San Diego, some during the Great Recession of 2008-14, where many of my properties were short sales distressed properties that the bank didn't want and was selling st 40-50% off.  

I have no other outstanding debt, except at the end of  2021, I did cash out refinance my primary house and borrowed about $800k against the equity of it ... But only because loan rates were so cheap (mine was 3% for 30 years) ...I couldn't just pass up on a lifetime opportunity of  a 30 year cheap loan that was way below the average rate of return of just about any other moderate to low risk investment .... Free money....🤣🤣🤣 So part of that is parked in safe bank CD's earning 5-5.625%, part of that is invested in dividend stocks and bonds earning 7-8%, and part of that is invested in slightly riskier stuff in the stock market that has done better than that, all of which outperforms my 3% loan rate...thank you Federal Reserve 🤣🤣🤣

Imho, Salary doesn't matter that much. It's what you did with your money over the years and and how you put it to work. I know plenty of doctors who make a lot but also don't invest and have very large student loan debt. I know a lot of higher salaries people who choose to overeextend and buy a very expensive home with a  very large mortgage and not have much left over (we call these people house rich, but cash poor- since the primary home doesn't really earn income for most people). If you can wake up tomorrow and not go to work, an it doesn't cause any financial stress, well then you put your money to work for you. That's regardless of whether you have nice toys or not. Lots of people will slave away working for nicer toys. I draw the line somewhere. 


So my new life pretty much is getting up at 5-6am to attend autoshop classes at the local community college so I can learn about how to rebuild car engines, auto body , welding, etc...stuff I always wanted to learn how to do but never had time...

I wish I had the bandwidth to have started my own tech company...oh well... Maybe my kid can and I'll work for her. Given how much I'm paying for her education and left over in a custodial account, she owes me ar least a 750s. I remind her that every so often... 🤣",mclaren

"Yeah I think it’s ok for taller skinny ppl. For the 600 and the 720, the steering wheel was touching my lap. The driver door was up against my shoulder. I felt claustrophobic and my right shoulder was close to the passenger. I’m 6-1 and not skinny with Wide shoulders. The Huracan with bucket seats is very comfortable.",mclaren
"Glad to be getting a cross-section of answers from what reads to be actual owners.   
McMedics (Sean and Kevin) are fantastic in these situations, especially because any 570 is likely going to be out of or at the end of it's warranty.  Questionable (with the restrictions) for many whether extended service plan is worth the dough versus having someone like McMedics come out and perform services/maintenance.

I went from dailying a reasonably-modified 997.2TTS -> shopping for a 650 -> buying a 720 spider a year or two ago.  Plenty of ink spilled on this comparison, but between the turbo and a 570 you'll pick up majorly in the areas the Turbo lacks (excitement, presence, exotic factor, steering feel, sensation of speed) and step backwards in the area of 'nags' - if you're easily bothered every time your precious supercar reveals a minor flaw, you'll likely be posting here looking for solutions to rattles, indicator lights that went away, etc.

The big problems are all mostly solve-able (get a PPI before purchase so you know where you stand, and keep oil in it), but the little stuff can annoy owners who are used to the typical Porsche ownership experience.  

If you daily the 911 now, you may be thinking you'll probably daily the 570 and you totally could - but there's some headwinds that keep most that have gone that route from doing it often.  Post back when you figure out what you're going to do, and if you fall in love with a 570 show it to us!",mclaren

"Tip: You can apply the extended warranty to a McLaren that is not under warranty.   The car must be bone stock, and go through an official inspection.   If it passes the inspection, or fails but you have the failed items fixed by the dealer, then you can get the warranty.  None of this is cheap, though, but I suppose if you are looking to buy a used one that you could have the dealer do the inspection as the ppi.  I think the inspection is in the neighborhood of $300 or so, I think.",mclaren

"Honestly, the 570s was the upper limit of how much I can spend on a car, and it will probably be the only car in this category I will buy, short of a lucky windfall. Most other Mac's are well over $200k, which is above what I would comfortably spend on something. Mac 570s coupes are selling way less than most newer 911s, which is one of the reasons why I went this route.


The maintanence cost and potential repair cost is a concern, but my car is CPO, and my understanding is if I want to continue having some warranty, I can for the next 12 years and it would be about $4500/year. I

The extended warranty isn't as good as the factory warranty, it doesn't cover ""wear and tear items or anything they say is body"" so excluded would be brakes, suspension, battery, and the door hinges (though some say mclaren will fix those unde goodwill) but hopefully would cover something catastrophic. I think I might do this while I get familiar with this car to see if it's serviceable myself. There's a few ""remote mechanics"" that have a good reputation on mclarenlife.com that fly to your location to do repairs and service , which probably is more fairly priced than dealers but then you'll lose the warranty coverage so I don't know.

My understanding is that routine maintenance like oil changes on the 570s isn't difficult. The oil used is basically Mobil 1 0w40 European spec oil that other euro cars use that is found at Walmart for $25/5 qts and you need 2 of them. There's 2 drain plugs and you need to disconnect 2 oil cooler lines for a complete drain, and replace 5-6 oil  seal rings that you can buy from McLaren for around $100, or source them yourself in the  correct sizes for a few bucks. And the oil filter is a cartridge time Maule/mann filter that is the same used by some V8 BMWs that you can find in FCPEuro.com for around $8-10. The major failure was DLD but that was on the 2016-17 and seems to have been revised for 2018+. This car doesn't have accumulators, which to my understanding  is also a high failure item on other cars like the 720s, but even then, I read it's not *that bad* to fix.

Brake rotors and pads are a bigger deal, and I was advised to ditch the ceramic rotors when it comes to that.

Battery is about $5k because it uses a Lithium ion battery pack, but supposedly someone developed a battery emulator for about half that cost that allows you to use an AGM battery, so from that point on it would be a standard AGM battery. Again voiding your warranty.

So I don't know. Maybe continue doing dealership service and get a warranty, 

Or take my chances and DIY, like I do for every other car I have. My initial impression so far taking apart the front frunk to get to everything behind it was it seems a little easier to access things than BMWs, but I haven't taken things apart to that extent yet. I've worked on the n55 and n62 BMWs which imho were kinda of a pain in the azz because the plastic parts break no matter how careful you try to be.


I enjoy working on cars, so I can probably get by with a few things. Hopefully can keep maintenance costs bounded somewhat.",mclaren

"A good post, well thought out and you are doing pretty well for yourself.

>I also own two cars the total monthly cost of which are something like $1,200.

The total monthly cost of these two is nothing too dramatic for your salary.  But do you really need three cars?  The 720s is almost reasonable as a daily driver.  I am guessing your other two are something like a Porsche SUV and some sort of 2 door coupe? Sure, they are nice to have, but do you have enough room to park them all in your garage and do you really need all of them? Things can easily get out of hand when you love cars and have the financial means.  Not only do you need to consider the initial purchase, but it is the registration, insurance, maintenance and garaging costs. Sometimes it is just better to rent an exotic car for a weeks holiday and hand it back, then next year you can rent the next new supercar and do it again. This is all a personal thing, but it worth considering all options.

>I’ve fallen in love with a 2020 720s spider with 7,500 miles with an asking price of about 250k.  
>  
>I put down a deposit on the 720 but I’m really thinking about pulling out.

Yes, you can afford it, but just spend your money wisely.  I would think that this was top dollar for a 2020 model, but it can also depend on what options it has.  It is not an exact science, but looking t the [results on Bring A Trailer](https://bringatrailer.com/mclaren/super-series/), there are some Spiders that have sold in the past 6 months comfortably under $250k, but again, it depends on the exact spec of the car.  Your financial position is so much better than most who are considering a 720s.  I would say it comes down to something that you fall in love with and are really passionate about and that suits your wants and needs.  Not just something you like and in a few months time you think ""I wish I got X colour"" or ""It is nice, but not exactly what I wanted"".  There are only going to be more 720s coming off leases as their owners upgrade to the new 750s, so there is no real worry about there not being any stock.  I think you can afford to be selective.

Overall, it really isn't a finance question as you sound pretty fiscally responsible. It is just about having things that allow you to sleep comfortably at night and focus on things that matter.   
But since you are looking at the big picture, I will add a few comments below.

>I’m a doctor who owns his own medical practice, and I’m 34. Last year I made about $1.3M. Of that, I invested $450,000 toward retirement, and will pay about $425,000 in taxes this April. I own a home which I owe $900,000 on and pay about $8200 a month for.

If your mortgage was set a few years ago at 2% or so, don't worry about this too much.  Also, paying taxes is a fact of life and if you are making heaps of money, then you have to pay taxes.  Just make sure you have a good tax accountant to get things right.

>I have about $1M cash in accounts

I would be looking at what to do with this.  Investing each month into ETFs and your retirement funds? Or something, not just sittin gin a bank doing very little  I assume you have a Financial Advisor (and someone who specialises in doctors) helping to point you in the right direction.

>Other monthly obligations are $2000 toward student loans

This was surprising.  If your interest on these is low (under 5%?) then it is okay just to pay this off slowly.  But if it is higher, then I would be paying this down as quick as possible and saving yourself alot of interest.  But, again, it depends on the exact details.  Good luck and enjoy your next McLaren.  Enjoy.",mclaren

"This is actually so helpful. I do all basic maintenance on a car myself, but I’ve never worked on an automatic car (only a manual) before so I’m assuming I can’t really do transmission work on these cars besides the fluid change. Also, I really want a McLaren Artura (or McLaren’s future plug-in hybrid), so I’m assuming the hybrid powertrain really raises the complexity of doing self-maintenance.

Also your note about financing helps a ton. I’m still in the mindset that a car is a 48 month payment, so I was going by that standard for the affordability of the vehicle relative to income. My typical rule is that my monthly car payment, for a 48-60 month period, needs to be <= 10% of my monthly gross income (I only pulled the trigger on my BRZ because the 48 month is a good bit under 5% of my gross monthly income), but I realize now that when you’re tying that much money into a depreciating asset, you really need to be judicious about managing your assets. I like the option of a high payment for when you’re doing hot, but low payments for when you’re not.

i paid a good chunk change to get a CPO 570s , probably $20k above what I could have gotten one of I took delivery elsewhere from a remote location and had it shipped not cpo , older car, but a few things that happened to me.

1. I had a terrible time getting insurance for it given I live in CA and don't have the cleanest driving record after backing into a Tesla with my X5 2 years while volunteering teaching a class at a high school over the weekend. (No good deed goes unpunished ). The dealer I bought it from bent backwards to make sure I could get the insurance and held my car and helped me jump through all the hoops to get insured. Had it been a delayed in a other state, it would have been a nightmare to deal with.



2. After I sold some of my holdings in my brokerage account to pay for the originally planned Artura, shortly after the stock market took a dip because of the inflation numbers and fear of more rate hikes from JPow and the Fed Reserves and semiconductor stocks and regional bank stocks. And since ended up having a bit left over from getting a 570s spyder, I the leftover money back into my brokerage as well as some money sitting in cash back into the stock market after things already came down a little....specifically in the 3x leveraged semiconductor ETF SOXL which I bought at a discount when the markets panicked.

Well , with all the hype surrounding generative AI, that sort of pushed the major chip companies to all time highs in February :  Nvidia, Amd, Broadcom...which pushes the 3x leveraged semiconductor SOXL ETF to all time high.  So I sold a good portion of my SOXL leveraged ETF , and between Jan and Feb , I already made back half of what I paid for my car in about 1 months by sheer luck...

If I waited to get.tje car, I probably would have left my money in my brokerage account, saw that ETF correct, and then be fearful and never bought the car nor reinvest money back into SOXL when it corrected. My portfolio probably would have been about the same as it is now, and i would still be Mac-less. Funny how this works...That's why despite what some people say, I don't like to take out debt to buy a car...because for me that is heavily invested in the stock market, selling and taking money off the table is my way to diversify and reduce investment risk. Because it forces me to move money from higher risk speculation into much safer cash positions .

Bottomline is, if you let your money work for you , instead of working so hard for your money, it sort of takes care of itself to absorb some of your occasional splurges .🤣",mclaren

Since the spec might be relevant, here's the link to the listing for you guys to analyze: [https://sarchioneautogallery.com/inventory/Used-2020-McLaren-720S-Spider-SBM14FCA2LW004821](https://sarchioneautogallery.com/inventory/Used-2020-McLaren-720S-Spider-SBM14FCA2LW004821)

You were pretty much spot on with your guess about what's in my garage lol. I have a Model Y performance and an Alfa Romeo 4C. I do have a third garage space, but at the moment I have a golf simulator in there. I would like to keep the 4C because it's a really unique car and possibly sell the sim to make room for the Mac. Alternatively, I may sell the 4C since I have a good bit of equity in the car and I could free up the cash and monthly payment to go toward the Mac.

The interest rates I have on the home and student loans aren't phenomenal.  I bought the house after the giant dip we had a few years ago, but rates haven't dropped sufficiently to refinance at this time.

As to financial planning, I sit on a lot of cash just because the business is doing really well and I've already got an investment plan to invest $300k/y toward a goal for retirement at 55. Whatever I have is just left-over. I also have substantial holdings in physical gold/silver as a hedge in case the market takes a shit. This is one of the reasons I love this particular car. I'm a gold bug and the frickin' car is gold. Symbolic for me.

I also am about to get engaged to a 4th year medical student who is going to end up as an anesthesiologist. I don't want to count on her income, but it's a pretty safe bet she'll end up making $500-600k once she's done with residency, so that'll accelerate our retirement plans.",mclaren

The IRIS 2 system can also be in all cars, two tone interiors are an option in all of them.  675LTs if equipped with the Track Telemetry cameras can narrow it down.

">so the top end acceleration will be superior

They both run a 9.8s in the quarter mile, even with the Porsche's AWD advantage. The McLaren isn't just faster (top speed), it is also quicker (acceleration) due to its better power to weight ratio. Hence the similar time but higher trap speed.

The 918 will take 0-60 and 0-100 sprints because those rely heavily on traction performance. In most roll races, the P1 will come out ahead.

>but on a race track the Porsche's stability and AWD makes it the faster car

Like you said, it's track dependant. There's circuits where each has the better time. But even so, most race cars and super/sport cars are RWD (for a reason).",mclaren

"For me, cheap about $8 more than my insurance for my ND Miata / 6month ... $584/6 months. 

This is with the $250k/500k liability I need for all auto and house/rental property  for umbrella insurance coverage....$1000 collision and comprehensive deductible and uninsured motorist. The collision and comprehensive on my Miata is $250 deductible , but considering a windshield for the 570s is around $4000-5000 I think, a $1000 deductible is sufficient for this car.

I had to jump through a lot of hoops to get insured. It ended up being my existing insurance but initially they weren't willing to consider me without first buying the car, and they wouldn't guarantee I would be insured once I owned the car. And I called about 18 other insurance companies, and all but 2 said flat out no. Mercury said it would take 2 months to approve , Farms said it would be $8880/6month with a $5000 deductible and 1000 mile annual cap. I bulked and said forget that.

Eventually the dealership that I bought the car from helped. They treated my payment as a deposit, gave me all the paperwork that proved I owned the car, and I submitted the paperwork to my own insurance and waited about 2 weeks. The dealership was willing to undo the transaction  if my insurance was denied out of goodwill, because they figured I would buy from them again even if this fell apart this time but eventually my insurance made me jump through a lot of hoops... For adding a car that costs $584 more every 6 months... Go figure... I'm not complaining. I asked if I could prepay my insurance for the next 5 years.... Lol... They said no. 

I was told there is a pretty big loss claim on Mclarens specifically within 1 year of ownership. I guess too many social media influencers crashing them within the first year of ownership. I was told a Lambo or Bentley  probably would have been easier to insure even if those cost 2.5-3x more. Because the claim payout on those is a lot lower.

Porsche is supposedly easier to insure.... But it was out of my consideration because 1) imho Porsches have become super inflated in price and at least where I am, too many people have them. And 2) every Porsche and Audi dealer I visited , the sales people were complete shitheads. Even at the local display store here in Fashion Valley , when I was just passing through the mall picking up a vDay present , and dropped by that Porsche / Audi store showing a 911 cab and a Audi R8... But the people in the store took one look and ignored me and put all their attention to only other person in the store,  some old white bearded guy. Wasn't the first time I was treated like shit in an Audi/Porsche showroom. Probably wouldn't be the last.
The McLaren/Lambo/Bentley/RR dealer were a lot more chill and nice to me, even when I went in looking like a hobo. First question they asked is if I wanted to test drive the Artura and 570s , unlike the Porsche or Audi experience.  Second question people asked was what I was currently driving ..when I said Miata, Mac dealer salespeople next question was ""oh cool, are you a spec miata driver? Do you track and autocross.? Oh I use to drive a spec miata etc etc.... answered the same question at the Porsche/Audi dealer , and the dingbats were like ""oh..these are much faster cars.."".. yeah, not shit Sherlock..
.. Lol.. Whatever. They are awesome cars. They just need to hire non-shithead sales people.",mclaren

"I don't know but I wasn't a doctor that made nearly as much on a salary. I made between $200-300k/year as a software engineer and later as a director for a few years before I retired last year at 48. 

I wasn't a big spender most of my life, and being a single dad that raised my kid mostly myself, I didn't have the luxury to start my own business to really rake in the dough.

My kid also goes off to college next year. Big expense. She applied to 14 out of state with early action and got into 11 of them , so I'm expecting she will be going out of state or private school. I already planned for that.

What I did learn is making money on a W2 paycheck was the worst way to make money because you are taxed the most both by the federal, state, social security , Medicare, SDI etc.. nor did I trust I would still be able to work as an enginerd all my life, because there is always some 20 something year old that can work faster and more hours than you, often at a significant discount overseas. 

So I've always tried to keep my debt close to $0, invest in assets that generate passive income, and for everything that was clearly a liability , paid cash for it or didn't bother buy.  I never took out a car loan, even when the cars i bought new.

So when some of the companies that I worked out went public or were bought out and my stock vested, it wasn't millions, but it was enough to buy smaller rental properties during a time when the RE market crashed and everything was 40-50% off back in 2013 as short sales or foreclosures here in SoCal. And whatever else money I had left, tried to put it to work on the stock market or my kids 529 college account so she wouldn't be stuck knee debt in debt, especially if she didn't end pursuing a high paid profession like law or medicine that could allow her to pay of the debt sooner. So I passed up buying nice cars for awhile , like the 991 911s and bought a foreclosed rental, passed on GTS for another rental , and so forth,  for the longest time enjoyed the POS 94 Miata I bought in 2013 for $1800 to learn how to drive manual and autocross track, and kept my then 13 year old Audi I bought in 2000 new at a steep discount thanks to CarOrder.com 

2020 was the year I made my last mortgage payment on all of my rental properties, I had no student loan debt , and the passive income from my rentals generated about half of my engineering compensation, at approximately 10-15% tax rate versus the 40% on a W2. The rest of my stocks saw appreciation, and so did my kid's 529 college savings account.

So, back in 2022 when tech started to have trouble , and companies started to get increasingly nasty, I had enough and decided to leave...and I haven't returned back. My kids 529k college savings account has significantly increased since the times I was making $1000/month contributions to it from the day she was born...Given we won't qualify for financial aid,  college costs around $50-80k/year depending on where...and her 529k will pay for up to 6 years of undergrad and grad school before the need for a student loan... And the custodial account should serve as a decent down payment for her first house.

I pulled $250k out of my brokerage account, was planning to buy an Mac Artura , but then got cold feet with the cost, so I ended up getting a nice CPO 570s Spyder for a bit less. It didn't feel right for me to be spending $250k on a car given I'm sending my kid off to college, I'm no longer working, and have no plans on working as a salaried slave again, nor do I have the business acumen to start a successful business at my current age. My financial advisor, who I didn't run this large purchase by before I did it (it was more or less a spontaneous decision) nevertheless assured me it was fine...because of my initial frugality and heavy emphasis on investing, he ran through the usual monte carlo simulation and showed me that even if I were to live to 98 years old, 98.2% of all the possible outcomes of that simulation would result in me having the same amount of net worth as as I do now , non inflation adjusted, 82% I would have a net surplus more than I have now, and 2% chance I would have less , and that 2% chance would involve something catastrophic , like the US financial system collapses. This also assumed social security would be bankrupt by the time I could in theory get anything , and assumed I would get nothing from it, as most financial planners think would be the worst case scenario.

So with that said, he gave me his blessings, and I said fvxk it , and picked up my 570s. Because a bigger issue was, lately I've been have some annoying back pain, and I can feel it at times driving my much smaller miatas...I don't feel it when I drive my 570s , at least not yet, but who knows what will happen if I wait another 5 or 10 years when getting in and out of such a low car might really be an issue.

So that's my take. I'm trying to enjoy life a little here, I worked my ass off most of my life, put up with a lot of crap before, prioritized a lot of other people ahead of me for a long time, didn't waste or blow money like there's no tomorrow, didn't go on exotic vacations regularly since that isn't my thing, nor do I havs any major vices like booze or drugs nor am I foodie that likes to wine and dine....and my debt load is non existence, and the minute debt I do have is a cash out refinance I did in 2021 on my primary becuase i was able to take out equity at 3% for the next 30 years , lol, and invest it in just about anything else for at least 5% or higher, even a no frills 5% bank CD... Free money!    

This is the first time I get to enjoy a part of what I earned on something that I like.  I plan on tracking my Mac once I get use to it, no different than what I already do with my two miatas. It's not a garage queen, it's not something I bought for status. And there's only so much one can do with these cars on public streets... 0-60 and 1/4 mile runs are hardly interesting and doing anything else on streets is irresponsible.. It's something I plan on enjoying because I like cars and driving them. I get different feeling for each of the 7 cars I drive, a lot of them are old beater cars.

Will I ever get something nicer than what I have now, I don't know. I can barely handle the 570s , can't imagine what it would be like with traction control off completely ,  and I have a lot to learn about it.

I cant tell you what to do since those are your personal choices. But from the sounds of things, for you spending $250k on a car seems like it would be noise on the floor relative to the rest of your earning potential over the next few years. 

The only thing I would look into is reducing your debt load. I have 7 cars, none of them have a loan...and I do the maintenance myself so that 1) make sure it gets done right and 2) financially it makes sense to keep-  otherwise it wouldn't make sense if I had to pay someone else to do work on the cars.

There is no other feeling than waking up every day, and not worrying about needing to go to work or making payments to keep a roof over you. Which is why I would say , get to $0 debt as soon as possible or have your passive income cover your expenses.... So if you want to go take classes or volunteer or work , like for me, it's under your terms ...not your creditors ....",mclaren

The 911 I know is a safe bet, but I dont really count it as an exotic personally. How does the cabin space compare to the 720S? Is your head also touching the roof? 

Use case is just as a fun/ daily car. I own my own business(es) and have employees, so no need to blend in, I prefer an absurd bright color. 
I have a Cayman right now as a temporary car and the cabin space, trunk space and handling is perfect. It also looks great. But the performance and interior tech isn't up to par. If I could have a Twin turbo flat 6 Cayman GT4 with a 992.1 911 interior, I would drive nothing else.",mclaren

"Had a 2018 720, loved it, but it spent a lot of time in the shop. CPO covered a lot of the issues but I decided I had enough. Bought 2022 GT and have had zero issues with it. Ive put 10K miles on it. The GT is a more mature, less technical platform which is why its been solid. It's great as a daily and for rallys. Obviously not the same as a 720 which is a GOAT. 

While the GT is reliable and solid, I do miss my 720 and I'm planning to move back to a 750,  765 or a GT3. The GT is heavy and while it handles well, it's not a track car nor does it match the beauty of the 7 series IMO.

They're all great cars, and if you're like me, you will only keep them for 2-3 years before getting something different. If that's the case, start with a GT and go from there.",mclaren

~20% of the cars out there are black. 

The murdered out look has been done to death. 

For sports cars in general, and top tier exotics more specifically, they’re designed to draw attention and purchased by people who want attention. So they should primarily be loud colors, but they’re not. They’re boring grey tones.

"Sorry man but what you’re wanting is not how insurance works with exotic vehicles. 

I have Hagerty for my 600LT and it’s great on both premiums and coverage. Yes it takes time because there’s additional underwriting involved so hurry up and wait. It’s a high dollar item, so they’re going to ask questions around previous exotic ownership and your experience with driving 500+ HP cars. Yes it sucks but if they don’t you’re going to get charged out the ass or have virtually no coverage on the vehicle. 

If you want to expedite the process get with a good insurance agency. They have relationships with providers to push things through but still not going to be same day.",mclaren

"It's not the cost of the insurance. It's the potential of the insurance company cancelling a policy because you broke terms and conditions and the lack of available alternative options in the current environment. No different than if you have too many water damage claims on a rental property (regardless of who's fault it is), the insurance company might drop you at the next renewal cycle, and there isn't too many alternatives in a state where most insurance companies are pulling out.  


It's true you can also pledge assets with a personal guarantee and not need insurance in my state, but that's just setting yourself of for major liability exposure, since you're then on the hook for paying for any legal defense for any reason someone sues you, as frivolous as it is. Not to mention, being self insured on a car would also make your umbrella insurance void.  


People often view insurance as cost and try to buy the cheapest one. I have a completely different view of insurance.. But the policy that has the most coverage, because if you actually have assets valuable enough to lose, you want the largest insurance policy you can get, and you want to make sure you don't do anything that causes the insurance policy to get cancelled.  


In muy state, insurance companies send out an semiannual mileage reporting form you're suppose to report your mileage. Although it's an honor system, things get very complicated if you ever end up in a body shop and they get the. repair involce with a largely different mileage from the body shop. For a run of the mill car, that's not a big deal. For an exotic, it's one of many reasons why an insurance company could deny coverage, no different if you take your car on a track without specific track insurance.",mclaren

I wish I kept my huracan longer as I’d get what I got in 2021 for it but at the lower cost of the 720s as it’s dropped over the past two years. You will absolutely love the 720s as I’m sure you have probably driven and know. I’m thinking right about the current time is maybe the best point to try to get into one. The 750s I think are mostly low production numbers and pretty highly specced to where there will be a huge price gap between the cars. One thing maybe worth considering is getting a 720s that doesn’t qualify for warranty. I am approaching the last year of my warranty and I’m kinda unsure if it’s worth keeping it in warranty. The cars actually are really well sorted out post 2017 and 2018. The warranties are super expensive and I could see maybe doing a ryft exhaust and m-engineering stage 1 tune and calling it a day. You could find a car that already has that at the discounted price these cars tend to give when going without a warranty.,mclaren

"You don't need to do real estate. Stick with something you enjoy doing and are good at. You have the ability to own a medical practice , I don't . You can do guest lectures at seminars and get paid for it, I can't. You have different doors than me, we are all different. 

Investment is actually pretty easy. I would recommend you just setup an auto investment account at any of the brokerage and setup your account so every month it automatically deducts from your paycheck or bank account and auto invests the money into an index ETF that tracks the stock market like S&P500 like VOO or the entire market like VTI, and forget that it exists. I did this starting when I was 20, before I got married,  stopped briefly when I was married for 5 years, and then restarted once I was single again. So I lost 5 years of auto-investing/compounding while.i was married 🤣. 

Most people aren't going to beat the stock market indexes consistently over a long period of time, especially those of us specializing engineering, medicine instead of finance who spend most of our time doing something else. So just make auto investments into index funds that track the market and forget about it and look at your account 10-20 years later. Worked for my 529k college savings account and worked for my vanguard index account. I do also some individual  stock trading off to the side too, and while I have an occasional good wins, there are also plenty of losses...because to do it right its like a 6am-1PM EST job ... Stick with the indexes and auto invest say $1000-3000/month into it. You probably won't even notice it and years down the road , you'll be glad you did because it was effortless.",mclaren

"Congrats on your 750s. I wish I could justify the price but the 720s just depreciated too much for me. I absolutely love my papaya spark 2019 coupe. For those that are split on the looks I can understand it but a lot may be related to the spec. Even with 720s, I see a lot that don’t do it for me so color, rim choice and options really can make a difference. Overall the front is weaker to me than the 720s. The side is practically the same and the back I prefer on the 750s. Plus the performance difference is notable. If anything they should raise used 720s value because these are selling well. The 750S is a better car of an already legendary car. Enjoy it in health!",mclaren

"It has a different clutch/flywheel, suspension work done, the fenders are sort of cup car-ish and the front wheels are wider than a stock one. 

I’m not afraid of mods, I mod my cars. My problem with this particular car is, the guy bought the car with some of them done and did others, so I would be buying several people’s work on the car. I was talking to a friend about it last night, we came to the conclusion write down the mods about the car that I like, price those out and find a stock car that comes with the stock parts (clearly) because this car doesn’t come with anything, and make the mods I want to it. 

If I buy a 997 which I’m actually leaning towards as a forever car, if I ever want to put it back to stock after I’m done really driving it just for value later, I think it’s better to start with a clean slate that I know what’s been done (to a degree, I realize I’m talking about a 16 year old car)",mclaren
"I had to jump through a lot of hoops to finally get insurance when I bought my 570s.

My current insurance is Costco/ConnectByAmericanFamily and while I was buying my car they said they might be able to insure my car but couldn't guarantee it, and required me to buy the car first before they would send it to underwriting for review (yes, backassward) . But I ended up getting insured by Costco/Connect(more later) after jumping through all their hoops while purchasing with the help of the dealership that guaranteed they would refund my money if I could get insured. And with the exception of my own Insurance no one else was willing to insure me at a where close to reasonable.

After about 2 weeks of extreme vetting, they ended up quoting me $584/6 month , $1000 deductible on collision and comprehensive 5000 annual miles on top of my $250/500k liability I have for all cars l have. That's about $8 more than I pay for my 2017 Miata every 6 months.


Most insurance companies no longer insure exotics. Many insurance companies no longer write new policies , especially in CA or other high claim areas. My insurance, Costco/Connect,  no longer writes new policies in CA.


And thanks to young social media influencers that previously bought McLarens, many insurance companies told.l me specifically McLarens have a high claim rate more so than Lambo or Ferrari. So macs specifically are harder to insure that  other exotics right now. If your current company doesn't insure it, and have the slightest blemish on your driving record, there's a high probability you won't be insurable or you will pay an arm an a leg and foot for it.



Out of all the insurance companies, the following insurance companies still offer insurance.

Hagerty: about $2500/year with 2500 annual limit $2000 deductible. But they wont insure first year exotic owners. You must have at least 1 year of experience owning an exotic 

Farmers: $8880/6month, 1000miles/annually $5000 deductible on comp and collision. I balked .

AAA: about $3500/year but if are in CA, you must be ""good driver"" rates or they won't underwrite any new policies. I wasn't 

Mercury Insurance: 1.5 months approval process. Lots of hoops, $3500/year , 2500mile limit annually, 5000 deductible .

Grundy: wouldn't talk to me because I was in CA and didn't have a ""good drive discount"".



Farmers was the only sure thing for me at the time but I wasn't going to pay $17k/year for insurance. Mercury was sat the time was still reviewing and told me it would take 2 months ..",mclaren
"Hopefully. I was at the Vegas race and if you think it’s hard to tell some of these cars apart on TV, try seeing them at night whipping by at 200mph. RB, Ferrari, Alpine, Aston really stood out, but the others were just a black mass.

720s is incredibly quick. It’s the pinnacle of engineering perfection. The car follows your instruction to the T.

"I’m just a huge car fanatic and always loved cars of all kinds. I’ve been fortunate (and partially moronic) to have owned a lot of fancy sports cars and the McLaren is by far better than the other cars in the class. I’m definitely not into the super car scene anymore and upgrading to the latest and greatest; nor can afford to be. God willing, I’ll keep this one for the long haul as I do love the design, driving experience and everything about it. They have kinda had a bad reputation and some of that was their own doing that they are working on fixing in the customer experience and reliability. I haven’t had any issues. I honestly don’t think they will stay that cheap on the used market because how expensive super cars are getting as things move forward post covid and with hybridization. The other companies that are copying standard practices that McLaren has been offering (entire carbon fiber chassis) to compensate for increased weight of the hybrid batteries are getting very expensive. I think that brings used values up sooner than later and people will kick themselves for not getting them at these prices. But that’s just a working theory.",mclaren

"The same thing happened to me in CA when I bought my CPO 570s in December from the local SD dealership.

I called over 14 different insurance companies after my own insurance said they weren't sure if they could insure my 570s and it would take about 3 weeks to determine if it could be insured...but I had to first take ownership and be on the title for them to even send me to their underwriter for consideration. It put me in a weird predicament that I could have bought the car , been temporarily insured by my current policy for 30 days, but then be denied and be uninsurable. The other 14 insurance companies all said no, so I had no choice but my to wait on my own. My dealership was cool. After I wired them the entire purchase price, they agreed to hold the funds and give me the paperwork that my insurance needed to show I was in the title and purchased the vehicle for my sole use. However they agreed to actually hold off transferring the car to me and registering it until I got confirmation that I was insured. They gave me about 3 weeks, though if it took longer they probably would have waited. The head of sales was understanding because he had issues getting insurance too. After 3 weeks my own insurance approved , for $584 extra every 6 months.


Part of the difficulty of getting insurance was  

1. Many insurance companies aren't writing policies any more in CA. My company is Connect/Costco by American Family. The stopped issuing new policies in CA.

2. Hagerty will only insure exotics after 1 year of prior ownership experience with an exotic 

3. State Farm and AAA will insure you if you have a CA good driver rating (I got into a minor parking lot fender bender and that disqualified me .. I should have paid out of pocket but the other guy wanted to run it through my is urancd)

4. Mercury insures exotics but you have to wait 30 days for approval.

5. Pacific Speciality insures exotics...but they also count comprehensive claims up to 5 years.

6. Grundy lots of people use them. Again, they require a CA good driver rating.",mclaren

"I spent a bit more got a 2020 CPO with 1 prior owner.  It had about 20kmiles on it with an extended warranty for 1 year.  I figure these cars need to be driven and to some extent someone before me worked through most of the issues, and something else major would be covered by the warranty . How my dealership service handles any issue will be exactly how I feel when I want to get another car later. So far, I have worn trim and carpets replaced under good will. And I'm having a control stalk replaced because occasionally the stalk control button doesn't seem to work unless I press repeatedly a few times.

The factory floor mats were like $450, lol.. I would never spend that much on floor mats 🤣

My friends gave me a list of things.

1. Tires
2. Condition of ceramic brakes
3. DLD
4. Windshield (has the original one been replaced with the updated one)
5. Door hinges (any cracks)
6. Battery condition
7. Lower front skid pad .. it gets mangled and a few thousand to replace.

My car has new tires, a new windshield, and lower front skid pad replaced, leaking washer bottle replaced.

Unfortunately , I scraped the new front skid pad leaving the dealership because I forgot to raise the car. Oops",mclaren
"No, but your friend who works at the dealership would know, no doubt.",mclaren

Compared to the Senna and Speedtail,mclaren
100%. Bought my 570s spider last year and I keep saying this to people.  Newer exotic cars are getting so expensive you can't get a super car with this performance at this price.  I don't think these are losing much value at all over the next few years.,mclaren
It’s probably my favorite color next to the Napier green. That color is killer. The papaya spark is tough to photograph well but just has such great flaking and pearlescent look to it.,mclaren

She didn’t really know anything about McLaren, or that they are my favourite super car marque, but went around happily taking pics of everything. She later mentioned it to my wife, who broke the news to me. After I exploded with jealous rage, I got to see the pics. She was shown the Solus GT (this is before the launch at Goodwood) and all sorts of goodies worth tens of millions!",mclaren

"Don’t mind these idiots only car guys hate the cyber truck everyone who could give a rats ass about a P1 loves the Cyber Truck. 

Car guys often think they know what a good looking car is.. to you maybe. Everyone else would happily take the cyber truck over a P1 100/10 of any day lol. 

Your hate of the truck will not make the car sell less. One just sold for $150k on C&B 

The hype will eventually die down once it’s more popular on the road but this car will eventually outsell any pick up we have today.",mclaren

"No less than $150k.  I’d plan current 650s prices to be the worst case for 720s 4 years from now. That would be your worst case conservative scenario.  Plus add potential repairs.  So, it could cost you $100-$140k over 4 years on depreciation, maintenance and repairs (worst case).  

So, you have to be ok with that.

I’d also calculate smiles and boners per depreciated $ over 4 years.  It’s clear that the 720s is a great idea!",mclaren

"I took it to my local exotic place once and they had a lot of trouble with anything but an oil change. And they were as expensive as the dealer. 

Mandatory in that the software had bugs and I was told this would fix them and also that not upgrading meant it was more likely to bug in the future. Probably bs but when I had all those issues with the software fucking up the first few months of ownership I don’t want to do all that again. I asked on McLaren life forum at the time and most suggested do it",mclaren

Radio stopped working, AC would not work, windows would not go up or down, doors would not open, etc... I had extended McLaren warranty so all covered but I would highly recommend making sure you have a warranty.

"For the most part, yes! I took notes😅:
 1. The wing is 6 bolts (YouTube) ez replace + add thread lock 
2. The diffuser is plug and play, remove the oem one but you need to lift or jack up your car 
3. The rear side skirt uses oem holes, the front side skirt needs to be drilled (need rivets+ds tape as well IMO)

For both the above, you’ll need extra M6*25mm bolts bc the CF is thicker than the oem plastic in a lotta areas (for bolting on the side skirt and the rear diffuser)

4. Canards = ds tape and sealant 
5. Rear splat = ds tape and sealant
6 The front lip is the hardest to DIY because it requires bumper removal… so it’s suggested to get your mechanic friend or take it to the shop for that one piece so that things aren’t jiggling at 200mph💀",mclaren
Not an LM since they only made 3 of them all in Papaya and were totally stripped out interiors with head sets it was so loud. This F1 has the downforce package/LM spec. MSO made two of these. Think the other from NZ sold for $20m.,mclaren

"570’s are personally very reliable. They are like any other manufacturer you’ll get a hand full that just have issues, it’s a hit or miss. The stigma comes from people that had MP4-12C’s, the handful that just had electrical issues, and 80% of them are people that never owned one. Just make sure you get a good PPI from a reputable company, majority use McMedics. It doesn’t guarantee anything but better peace of mind and no maintenance isn’t $10k unless you’re including insurance. It’s closer to $5k from experience. If you’re worried about resell, just look for one loaded with factory carbon options, upgraded speakers. Drive the shit out of it and have fun. They aren’t meant to be garage princesses.",mclaren

"I’ve always had an interest in cars generally since I was a kid, you know, in the “cool thing going fast” sort of way. McLarens just look good to me even if I know I’ll probably never get to own or drive one. 

However, I think more than anything GTA online has fostered my love for McLaren. The “F1” equivalent in GTAO—the “Progen P1” I think—looks really great and has a ton of fun customization options. More recently I acquired the GTAO equivalents of the  F1 GTR Longtail and an older formula one model that I don’t know the name for. I have had so much fun in GTA online over the years and those cars are some of my favorites.",mclaren

Make a big downpayment of $75k+, then be willing to shell out $1500+ per month on a car payment for 5 years.

Add another $700/month for insurance and maintenance stuff.

I think someone who can drive a McLaren either buys it jn cash completely and makes well over $150k a year without major debts like credit card or student loans.

Or someone making over $250k and makes monthly payments because they don’t have $150k sitting around.

Imo, most super car drivers are probs pulling in $300k-$1M+ a year in income. Or their investments have appreciated so much they liquidated and bought toys. 

Just focus on your income potential and the rest will work itself out.",mclaren

"Not driving it kills every car, I honestly don't get why people buy nice cars and then don't drive them! Just put PPF over it plus ceramic and go enjoy them.

At least match the paint you twat waffle.",mclaren
"That being said, it does depend a little bit on what exactly you're looking for when choosing one of these cars.  Most will agree that the driving experience of a 675LT Spider is hard to beat.  If it's something you'll drive on a more ""daily"" basis, then the 720S is definitely more suited for that.  In Comfort mode, I'd have no hesitations doing a cross-country road trip in a 720S.  The 600LT/720S interior is also definitely more modern if that's important to you.",mclaren
That's a good point. I think you solved the riddle for me,mclaren
On Sydney road.,mclaren
You are a much more successful doctor than myself and I own one on much less income. You know all the general rules and guidelines. This would barely be a problem by even very conservative investment standards. I’d more lean to exploring the reasons you find such hesitation on something that doesn’t really warrant concern over potential of regret by any rational reason. I say that humbly. I on the other hand should have not purchased it when I did and that does deserve its own kind of recalibration. Life is pretty good if you are worrying over the potential of regret that would not impact your lifestyle should you actually experience the regret and sell it. Most people won’t ever have that comfort. Be blessed. Hire me as your practice therapist or something too!,mclaren

You’d rather have one with 45k and good history and all the maintenance done than one with 4k that’s sat most of the time.

I don't know much about the history yet but my wife and I have been watching all the ""documentary"" shows on F1, Indycar and NASCAR. I have to say though from what I have seen I really like McLaren in both Indy and F1, and I might be leaning more towards Indycar as a fan though. I will say I think F1 has a better format with limiting teams to two vehicles and having a Constructors and Drivers championship.

"Love the McLaren history and liked the idea of the McLaren in the garage with my other British toys in the form of a Sunbeam Tiger and a race-prepared Cobra replica.  The McLaren F1 was the epitome of performance for me and changed the industry and the modern McLarens have remained true to that vision.  Ended up with a more expensive Ferrari that doesn't have the same performance, but the wife likes it better.  I' wouldn't be the least bit surprised if I still buy one at some point.

Amazing Car Brother! Wishing more success ahead,mclaren
Thanks the spec is what drew me to purchase it. It’s well specced and I would have done it worse if I was left to my own decisions. The original owner only put 400 miles on it when I picked it up and had the car fully covered in protective film as well as windshield protective film on it. I had the dealer add tint and some extra warranty. MSRP was 356k which is pretty well appointed for a coupe. Those rims on it are definitely my choice with the papaya spark and the blacked out sport exhaust brought it all together for me. so it just sang to me overall!,mclaren
"I’ve had a Taycan and a 911 Turbo S. If you want *spirit*, reliability, and don’t care much about being a “head turner,” Porsche is a great car. Ultimately, I moved from Porsche to a McLaren because I wanted two things;

- People to look

McLaren provides that across the board. Porsche only drew attention from other Porsche enthusiasts. They’re basically a glorified Corvette - you get to be a part of their *club*.",mclaren

Was my first more proper supercar. But I love the looks. The taillights from the p1 the headlights are gorgeous. I love the 600lt too of course it’s pretty similar in appearance but I’d take the 570/600 over the 650 or 675lt or whatever they might have more power or what it may be but I think these just look absolutely perfect.,mclaren

A Range Rover is a trophy wife/upscale soccer mom car. End of discussion.

The McLaren is going to be the fastest and most exotic of the bunch, by far. It’s going to turn heads everywhere you go. It will cost the most in regular maintenance and insurance. By now, the previous owners ate most of the depreciation but the 570S is a YouTube/TikTok’er clout car—many have been abused, missed maintenance intervals, and it will continue to drop in value simply because there are so many of them out there.",mclaren
Thank god these don’t exist 😂,mclaren
Pretty sure it's fh5 at main festival sight,mclaren
I drove out for 2-3 years haha not this whole time thankfully. Thank you,mclaren
"I see this argument all the time, and all of my McLaren group, and myself with two old McLarens, a 12C and 675LT, have had zero issues outside of electrical gremlins that sort themselves out after turning off the car for 30 mins.   I have over 20,000 miles on my now 11 year McLaren. I would drive it across the country in a heartbeat.  My 675LT is also approaching 20k miles. Both run like champs.  

My 12C is an early VIN which had more bugs than later ones.  Many people confuse consumables with reliability.   Accumulators for example, they give out after 1-2 years if the car sits around. I drive the piss out of mine, and they last me 4-5 years.  Letting any Supercar sit, let alone a McLaren with hydraulic suspension is detrimental.  

I’m only required one maintenance a year from McLaren service and people skip those.  They’re typically around 4-6k. Really not bad considering my 12c was nearly 300k MSRP, and my 675LT was more than 300k from a low volume OEM .  These are expensive cars with a lot of tech that was ahead of their competitors and in some cases still are. Things will fail if you don’t drive them and let them sit around, or just from a wear standpoint.  

Most people compare base 911s to McLarens. Base 911s with 360HP that barely rev 7000.  McLarens are all powered by a 3.8 L Twin Turbo flat-plane crank v8 making at least 590HP with a nearly 9,000 RPM redline, or by the 4.0L making a lot more power.   I’ve seen plenty of 911s blow 3.8 and 4.0 9 engines on groups, in my personal group of exotic car owners, and on forums.  High performance cars fail all the time. Look at the corvettes, the Subarus/Toyotas etc.",mclaren

I’ve personally owned a 720s(2 years) and a 765LT(also 2 years).

A good friend of mine put blue painters tape from front to back for the racing stripe.   While it wasn’t perfectly straight, and he went right over the front and back windshields, it did give it a few extra horsepower. 

All kidding aside, my kids think my car is a super car.   They think it has turbo cause I verbally sound it out.   They think the spoiler is so cool.   It has an e-brake, that’s cool too!

"I’d say about 2-3k yearly for service and mandatory “software updates” to keep the system from crashing. If you don’t live by a dealer and want warranty work or just work done by McLaren then budget at least 2k for rt transport. Tires every 2-3 years at least if you buy the sticky stuff or obviously more frequently if you track. 

So for me, 3 ish hours from my dealer, I spend about 5k a year without anything going wrong. 2018 570s spider. The one time the computer crashed and killed the window switch and made the roof stop working. That cost about 10k and a 6 month wait for the window switch to come from England. That was warranty work and they covered transport one way, of course it had to go back three times as parts trickled in. Since then no issues, at least.

"Might be a stupid question, but never dealt with exotics before. Is it better to go used for mclarens?  Or should a prospective buyer go new? I know the idea is for someone else to eat the depreciation so that you can own it after the price “settles” to the “true value”, but I’ve historically been opposed to getting used because I started driving more after the pandemic when the used market prices blew up (mid-20’s so I graduated school right after COVID hit). 

Also, for example, for my car (BRZ/GR86), the unwritten rule is that you almost never get it used because the demographic that owns those cars tends to beat the shit out of it on a racetrack or canyon roads, and the flat-4’s on those are notorious for having oil issues (starvation and burning oil in the high RPM ranges).

"I have a 720s on a higher deposit and better monthly than you outlined and I still expect to loose quite a bit when I come to sell it. I knew that going in and I don't regret it at all, the car is a blast.   


In your case I would definitely go for the Artura if you want the most sophisticated McLaren that is also not ridiculously expensive. For the price, I don't ink there's much better on market.  Driving wise, the I think the Artura will be better than a 570s but a 570s with a sport or MSO titanium exhaust will sound a lot better. A 600lt will sound even better and it shoots flames stock.

That said why don't you also consider the 720s? (and maybe I'm biased because its my current car) but A 720s is faster than a 570s, 600lt and possibly Artura and it definitely looks better than all of them in my opinion because of the sidepod-less body and addition of a big active rear wing. I do think my old 570s sounded better than the 720s but overall i still prefer 720s because of its looks. I would consider the GTS ahead of most other car brands' GTs but not ahead of any of the other McLaren sports or super series cars.",mclaren

"I have a 600LT and a 997 GT2. 

Totally different cars. Really hard to compare. A .7 GT3 is fantastic. So is the LT. I think I'll probably keep the GT2 for ever (it's just so rare and good) and I don't have the same thought for the LT. That said, the LT is a lot more visceral to driver - louder, stiffer, faster. More annoying at gas stations and on the road (McLaren gets unwanted attention, no one pays attention to the GT2 at all.) 

Value on the .7 GT3 is likely more solid w/ upside than the 600LT. Just the nature of McLarens. That said if the seller really messed with the GT3 that could hurt value/resale for you.

The question was: Cars that never lose VALUE?

Answer: “1% of classic car owners are professional investors. they have a climate controlled warehouse, a mechanic on staff, and largely don't plan on using the car. they seek the lowest mileage, best example with the intent to hold for a long period

the rest of us are not professional investors. we should seek out the cars that bring *us* joy. it could be the sound. it could be the drive. it could be because it puts a shit eating grin on your face. buying a classic car purely as an investment is idiotic. there are much better risk/ reward assets, especially after considering carrying costs and transaction fees

yes I understand that this ethos in some way conflicts with my job as an investor. but in a lot of ways it doesn't?”

There are a few seat options for huracans.. comfort, carbon seats (adjustable back, and advanced carbon buckets. I think the comfort seats are an inch higher than the advanced carbon buckets. I had the buckets and they were really snug, but it allowed me to somewhat be able to fit.

The McLaren is going to feel much faster than a 610lp, but the 610 will have a lot of sensations and drama with the bangs and pops and N/A motor. If you shift the 720 just right, it’ll make a loud gunshot noise and it’s fun when that happens, but the huracan will just make crazy noises repeatedly.. it’s almost a little forced. 

Both are awesome, I traded in my performante for the 720 spider. Not sure if I regret doing it.. both are a ton of fun.",mclaren
675lt is just a work of art,mclaren
P1 is the best looking car of all time IMO,mclaren
"I tested a 580-2, 610-4, and the performante.. all were 2019 or older, so not sure how the EVO’s or tecnicas are, but I definitely agree with the exhaust not matching the speed at times. Don’t need bangs and pops going 25 while not accelerating hard, but man is it awesome accelerating at 7500rpm and hearing that thing roar",mclaren
"How tall are you and which huracan trim are you cross shopping? I have owned all three.. currently have a 720 spider, had a huracan performante, and owned a 991.1 and 991.2 turbo s. I’m 6’2.

The huracan was tiny inside. My head was up against the roof the whole time. 911s have great accceleration and are fun of course, but nothing like the performante or 720. Turbo s blends in well - that’s a pro for some, con for others. 

I have not had any issues with mine, but do feel like the performante was a stronger car build wise. Obviously a 911 is going to be a solid perfectly lined up and butttoned up ride. 

The big question I have is: what will its use be? Do you need to blend in the office parking lot?",mclaren

"What kind of modifications? That would scare me. I have owned a 991.1 gt3rs, a 991.2 manual gt3 and recently was in a really really difficult decision between a 600lt spider and a 720s spider. I ended up going for the 720 because the 600lt got sold while I was trying to decide, but man that was the toughest choice I’ve ever made for cars. 

Between the 991.1 gt3rs and the 991.2 gt3, I regret selling the gt3rs and not the gt3. If you start leaning towards the 3rs, take it for a 30min+ test drive to see how your back and ears feel after!

"Yeah I get that, nothing beats an NA V10 lol. The Turbo S and 720S definitely don't have the same sensation. But I've heard an exhaust and or high flow headers can help a lot with that. 

I think I'm going to have to try a Huracan. If its uncomfortable to get in an out of every single day, then its not the right choice if I'm going to be driving it regularly for fun. 

But this has been really helpful! I do appreciate it a ton. 

One last question. Handling wise, how are the Huracans and 720S' compared to the Turbo S? I know they're not quite as maneuverable with the longer chassis",mclaren

Getting the seat to fit isn't the problem. However the electrics will be. Does anyone know if this is at all possible? We're afraid the seat control computer needs to communicate with the McLaren ECU, which obviously we don't have.

Now I am coming from a Porsche 718 GT4 Manual which you had to make sure you was in lower than normal gear to get the most out of that engine so this might be helping me in minimising the perception of turbo lag as I make sure I get a low gear ready before flooring it.

  
I can say though that this car amazes me with the grip levels and performance even with such low outside temperature and even when it loses traction its so predictable so not as scary as some cars I’ve driven – Looking at you 2019 Aston Martin Vantage….",mclaren

But when Porsche and dealers start trying to play the game of ""exclusivity"" like Ferrari does, it really rubbed me the wrong way...I don't have an issue of there being a waitlist...but it seems like you're at the mercy of the randomness of the dealer and the manufacturer to get on it.

He hasn't had any other issues though, but he doesn't drive it that often, which I personally think is going to bite him in the arse one day.

If you can afford lambo maintenance, I'm sure you will be able to afford mac maintenance. Why are you looking at 570s though? Will the budget stretch to a GT or a 720s? Here in the UK they aren't *that* much more.",mclaren

2) There is no exception in the ADA for whether a business is closed or not. While states often have their own laws around handicap parking, there is not one on the books that exempts if businesses near the spot are “closed.”

For example, this is California’s code:

*CVC 22507.8.

(a) It is unlawful for any person to park or leave standing any vehicle in a stall or space designated for disabled persons and disabled veterans pursuant to Section 22511.7 or 22511.8 of this code or Section 14679 of the Government Code, unless the vehicle displays either a special identification license plate issued pursuant to Section 5007 or a distinguishing placard issued pursuant to Section 22511.55 or 22511.59.

(b) It is unlawful for any person to obstruct, block, or otherwise bar access to those parking stalls or spaces except as provided in subdivision (a).

(c) It is unlawful for any person to park or leave standing any vehicle, including a vehicle displaying a special identification license plate issued pursuant to Section 5007 or a distinguishing placard issued pursuant to Section 22511.55 or 22511.59, in either of the following places:

(1) On the lines marking the boundaries of a parking stall or space designated for disabled persons or disabled veterans.

(2) In any area of the pavement adjacent to a parking stall or space designated for disabled persons or disabled veterans that is marked by crosshatched lines and is thereby designated, pursuant to any local ordinance, for the loading and unloading of vehicles parked in the stall or space.

(d) Subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) apply to all offstreet parking facilities owned or operated by the state, and to all offstreet parking facilities owned or operated by a local authority. Subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) also apply to any privately owned and maintained offstreet parking facility.*

"The most important question when purchasing a McLaren is not the particular car per se but, “is there a reputable dealer near you.” Even with me little 2018 Camry I’ve had to switch dealerships in order to get the right serviceman. The second thing is understanding upkeep. They have to be driven and plugged in as well for the hood of the mechanics and electronics of the car. Sorry to get all preachy but yes, a well taken care of 570s can be a reliable sports car, even a great one but it is definitely a joint venture with the owner and McLaren’s service.",mclaren

Likewise, Safeco - avoid if at all possible.  I didn't insure an exotic with them, but I had my classic excellent-condition, irreplaceable 60's Flxible bus/RV insured with them - it caught fire due to shoddy mechanic work, and they literally wouldn't pay a dime even though I had full coverage.",mclaren
"From a US standpoint, that price is a bit to good to be true. Looking at the website, other 570Ss are around the same price. Could be a salvage/rebuilt title.",mclaren

"If you can avoid the first run of 720s then you should be fine reliability wise.

The suspension accumulators will need replacing every 3-5 years, and tbh the biggest killer of McLarens is them not being driven.

You've got to drive them for a decent amount of time at least a few times a week. And when you aren't using it, leave it on the trickle charger.

Had an issue where the parking brake stuck on it once but other than that it’s just been routine maintenance….well I did just have one of the skid plates replaced today, but that’s a result of 24k miles on not the best roads.

"No. Just no.

Looks like something someone from a deep southern state who has done far too much money on the lottery/bitcoin/Gamestop might do if they took too may Class A party favours and wondered what the bustard child of a 720 and a F150 might look like.",mclaren

I just picked up a set of 5000TLX frames. The older 7000SLX (standard length) frames I had weren't long enough for the 720S. The frame extensions increase the required ground clearance quite a bit.,mclaren
"People are saying this is the autobahn in Germany.

_""Most sections of Germany's autobahns have two or three, sometimes four lanes in each direction **in addition to an emergency lane (hard shoulder)**. A few sections have only two lanes in each direction without emergency lanes, and short slip-roads and ramps""._

"7xx was too much car for me . Both in terms of the power and the cost.

Pretty awesome if you can jump into one right away.

"I waited and now have a hard time enjoying the cars I own.  Eyesight, reaction time, the caution that comes with wisdom and experience ect.  Plus, somedays, just getting in and out of them can be a literal pain.

On the other hand, if thirty year old me had the cars I now own, I would probably be either dead or in jail.

Schedule a short meeting with your financial planner and run the numbers by them.  They will know you and your fiscal position best.  

As an old fart, I guess what I am saying is wait, but don't wait too long.  Obligations have a way of piling up and pushing back on our dreams.

"Gave up?  On ever being able to afford something like this?

I don't think I've ""given up"" as much as I've properly assessed my situation and realized I have no path to that kind of money.

Looks sick,mclaren
I think I can add a couple more pictures if that helps. Is it common for the steering wheel to have the 'McLaren' logo rather than the symbol?,mclaren
it's gotta be the widowmaker for me,mclaren
The 675 has the logo on the tach so that can be written off,mclaren
To me that is sad,mclaren

"You can do all the work yourself. I own an MP4-12C and a 675LT, and I do all fluid changes, accumulators, and have cleared the headlights in the 12C myself.   I’ve got over 20k miles on my 12C and 675LT is climbing quickly lol.   The only thing you can’t do is reset the service intervals reminders because it requires a McLaren diagnostics tool. You can move the date in the car backwards, or you can spend $1,500-$3,500 for tools that can reset dates but also do other things. 

I paid cash for my 12C and financed part of the 675LT with CHASE, have since paid it off.  You can also use companies like Woodside Credit.  I’ve used them for other cars before and was pretty straight forward.  20% down, and 6% rate for 144 months.   Now the rates are way higher though.  What I like about Woodside is that often they don’t report the commercial loans to your credit, and doesn’t affect my credit lines for my business. It’s also great if you don’t want the wife finding out you spent $300,000 on a car lol 😂",mclaren

"really depends on the use case  


Mclarens don't like to parked - most owners who don't drive their cars tend to have more issues with the car

&#x200B;

AMG GTR has great reliability and is a great car overall

personally I would get the AMG GTR - just the peace of mind and not needing to worry about extensive repair bills  takes the cake",mclaren
"Koenigsegg.

Sorry, love my McLaren doors and Lamborghini started that door thing but nothing beats how the Swedish company does it.",mclaren
"I agree, want to test drive the 650S before I decide anything as I haven't had the opportunity yet. That said the AMG GTR I'm looking at is in hell green magno so it has that in your face color.",mclaren

I wouldn’t do a tire/wheel policy. We do not offer one at our dealer as it is rarely an issue. Just be careful and avoid potholes… Most McLaren wheels range from $1800-$3500😅,mclaren
"tavarish hardly rebuilt that car if we’re being honest, he’s invested more than one would cost brand new and it still doesn’t move under its own power.

the “rust” in cyber trucks are just iron deposits from other cars grabbing onto the stainless and obviously rusting but the truck itself isn’t.

the cybertruck is 1000x more reliable than any mclaren hands down so collectively those are pretty shitty comparisons",mclaren
That’s cool,mclaren
Keep this colour with silver or chrome wheels,mclaren

I’ve owned my 17 570s for 3 yrs and would make 10-20k right now if I sold.,mclaren
The most expensive one so I can sell it and get something else,mclaren
I don’t know the exact amount yet. Will find out soon but it’s prob between 400-500k. Nothing like being a slave to the govt for a big chunk of the year 🙃,mclaren

What a timeless design. A true Mclaren Classic.,mclaren
"In that case, I'd rank 675LT Spider, then 600LT Spider, then 720S Spider.  Some people choose the 600LT for the top-mounted exhaust (with flames!) and the more modernized interior, but most would probably say that the 675LT is the better choice for driving experience and also for rarity.",mclaren
