"Wow. I totaled my old Santa Fe and GEICO didn't cut me off. But when I got my new Santa Fe (2018 base model) l, they raised my rates TWICE in one year. That's when I started looking elsewhere. I got a quote from NJM that was $1,000 less a year than GEICO, so I dropped them and went with NJM. I have no regrets.¬†",Hyundai
"Disconnecting the battery won't have any other negative effects.

That said, it's brand new... take it to the dealer and have it fixed.",Hyundai
That's not entirely true. I've seen 3 and 4 possible. It depends on the car and what GDS lets you do.,Hyundai
"There are no engine related recalls for the 2008 Santa fe. They're all equipped with a pretty reliable pair of v6s.¬†


It's a 16yr old vehicle. If maintainence has been neglected I'd expect it to fail regardless of manufacturer. I have to beg my younger sister to get her oil changes and somehow despite killing her 2004 civic she doesn't learn.",Hyundai
"Doubt it ‚ÄúJust Happened‚Äù. Starter replacement would have to have done something. Push the dealership a bit more. Did they attempt to fix it as it could be possible it might be some sort of bug that‚Äôs triggered it and nothing is actually wrong with the Infotainment system. 

In the case where the infotainment is messed up and the dealership still refuses to do something, try looking around online and see if you can find one from a junkyard and throw that into it.",Hyundai
Some nice paper weights,Hyundai
"Strongly gonna disagree that a car in the year 2017 isn‚Äôt smart enough to self-diagnose something as important as low oil. It tells me when the tire pressure is a few PSI too low, but not when the oil is at dangerous levels?! I find that a hard pill to swallow. I appreciate the feedback though on the warranty! Going to check VIN‚Äôs now that I have daylight and a weekday ahead of me",Hyundai
Is it magnetic maybe? I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it if you‚Äôve already done the pushing and twisting though.,Hyundai
God I hope mine does.,Hyundai

There is a difference between expensive and ridiculous,Hyundai
Idk why but I think some mudguards go well with those wheels.,Hyundai
"Selling the car and avoiding problematic engine types, is the best prevention, but I get it, trading a car makes you lose a lot of money, because dealers suck, as they all low ball what you have to offer, and everything on their lot is all magically glorious. I hate that game myself.",Hyundai

Looks awesome,Hyundai
"My dealership's mechanics send me a video with things that they have found during the walk around when the car is in for regular servicing (which includes checking the tire tread depth and the brake pads). You learn a ton of information from those videos. They checked under the hood the last time, and found out that the sparkplugs needed to be replaced (this was at about 57,000km approximately). This is when the car also went through the throttle body service, and the engine shampoo. 

It goes into the shop April 8th so I can get the winter tires off and put the summers on (dealer will store them). The next servicing interval is in June or when the car hits 63,000km (approximately). 

As for your story on the quote, I'd rather pay the quote than to have something develop later that could've been prevented. Shit happens, that's not on you. You told them.",Hyundai
That would make sense,Hyundai
Paint Protection Coating.  It is a film that can be applied to glass for increasedUV protection and and as a damage shield.,Hyundai
Had 230k on my 2018 before I sold it for $500 to a friend. It had the oil consumption problem but that was it.,Hyundai
"If I can have it paid for by not me, I‚Äôm definitely getting this back to perfection. I‚Äôve never had a new car, I don‚Äôt know if one of the many warranties would cover this, also the person who did it maybe pay to fix it, so I‚Äôll see what the quotes are. 

But this is an option",Hyundai
Also the avn has a modification,Hyundai
"traded mine for a pt cruiser

can't guarantee it won't catch fire, but at least it won't get stolen lmao",Hyundai
That sucks that you have to deal with this. How long have you had it?,Hyundai

"Personally on the other side here (hyundai tech), but in my experience the long block and all gaskets that go with it get replaced (exhaust, intake, fuel injectors) it's more the the accessories that I'd be concerned of as those are always transferred from old block to new if in good condition.",Hyundai

"I am (not so) patiently awaiting the release of the 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Limited.  A quick Google search shows me that many dealerships already have them in stock, save for my own.  Here‚Äôs hoping Hyundai updates its website sooner than later, as I‚Äôd really like to tinker with trim options and read more detailed specs.

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre being scammed at all, though I would keep any upfront deposits to a minimum.",Hyundai
"It'll buff out.

Contact Hyundai and see about getting a contractor to give you a quote on resurfacing your driveway and possibly your vinyl siding.

At least no one's hurt.

Good luck bud!",Hyundai
Thank you for the list.  I think it may wait on it.,Hyundai
Sad. Hopefully they will reimburse you for any money you spend on a rental,Hyundai
"There is more to your story that is affecting your quote. Location or ? Not sure. 

I would call around, try a local broker. I pay considerably less for more vehicles. But, I also live in a low crime area and haven't had any claims for years.",Hyundai
It puts out the engine fire when that will occur.,Hyundai
Don't know why Sonata/Optima has more problems than Elantra/Forte platform. The steering coupler is a known problems. Since they use plastic. Just get an aftermarket  coupler and go on YouTube. There's video that show you how to replaced.,Hyundai
You wont get a title until you pay it off. They can switch the owner on the app with other purchase docs. Might need to call to confirm what is needed. The dealer put the wrong email address on mine when they tried to set it up for me. They wanted to see the contract.. maybe? Can't remember now but it was an easy fix.,Hyundai
"Darn, but now that I heard of it... I kind of want it.",Hyundai
That's awesome to see. I bought a 2010 Sonata new and just passed it to my daughter with 160k on it and zero issues. I got me a new 24 Elantra in December and I love it so far!,Hyundai
FFS this. Do this.,Hyundai
Not upvoting the accident ‚Ä¶ just the fact that your wife is ok!,Hyundai
"I mean i don‚Äôt mind if that is an option. As in, come in and get it installed maybe during my first service or something. It‚Äôs annoying yes. But still that‚Äôs ok. Atleast I‚Äôd still have it fixed",Hyundai
Understood!  And thanks. ,Hyundai
"To be honest they have to have more find print. Especially because that ad is super generic. I don‚Äôt know how this could be seen as deceptive as they don‚Äôt even advertise any specific numbers or models. 

This is all a result of increased regulation on dealers and manufacturers when it comes to marketing. That in itself protects the consumer and is a good thing. As a result they have to disclose a lot to ensure anyone who may misinterpret the ad has an avenue to find out more about what it is truly advertising. 

All in all there‚Äôs nothing negative about this fine print. If you read into it I‚Äôm sure you will see it‚Äôs mostly just a bunch of definitions. Nothing wrong with helping clarify things for a consumer.",Hyundai
Canadian warranty also works in the continental US according to Hyundai docs.,Hyundai
"There's a part that's liability, that covered amount didn't change much. 

Then there's the car. New car, more expensive parts, more likely to be totaled in a collision with all the crumple zones. Slightly more desirable to thieves. 

You add it all up, their risk assessment goes to 588$. 

Hopefully you got several quotes and just didn't stick to your old insurer for this. With a little luck you'll save a bit.",Hyundai
"How did you try to do it? For my digital key I have to double tap the power button (iPhone), select the ‚ÄúPalisade‚Äù card from my list of cards, and then kind of move my phone around over the door handle for a while until it unlocks. Then place phone on the wireless charging mat and start. 

I never use the Bluelink app because it‚Äôs slow for me",Hyundai
"I guess it depends, my previous car was a 2010 Subaru Legacy with the 3.6L H6.  Recommended spark plug replacement was at 60k and 120k.  I sold it at 130k and never did the spark plugs in it and it ran perfect.  I read stories of others running them to 120k and then changed them and they said they still looked to be in great condition at that.point too.  Not quite sure what I wanna do with my Hyundai and them yet though lol.  The dealership hasn't been pushing me for them.",Hyundai
Does ur engine light come on as well when the steering is stiff or no? It is either going to be a wheel speed sensor/ tone ring orrrrr if the engine light also comes on its going to be CAN line codes and it's the camera.,Hyundai

"When i bought my 22  sonata n line from a 14 limited, i got a quote with the exact new vin number.  The quote i received was $29 higher from the 14.  6 months later it went up $198.  Then a 18% overall rate increase company wise, than another increase due to parts and labor cost.  Paying double now.  After switching agents and asking why the increase with the exact vin, he told me some agents are just about growing and not quoting  the exact vin.  I have been a state farm customer for over a decade.  Now its just beyond ridiculous so time to move on.  Hope this makes your situation a bit better.",Hyundai

"My digital key only has 9 more ""offline"" uses and today was the 1st and only time I've ever used it the 1+ year I've had my car.

Sad part it didn‚Äôt come with a owners manual I need to order one & ya I seen valvoline being really good I‚Äôll probably go with that would you know why my car at times not all the time at a red light stopped it gets a little rpm jump which makes the car lunge a little like I thought maybe a/c compressor was kicking on/off?,Hyundai
"The connector for the 2014 with LEDs would be likely be different, also.",Hyundai
"Sounds like whoever did the PDI set your service interval for severe conditions. That's usually 3750 Miles / 6 months. Otherwise it would be either 7500 Miles or 8000 Miles /12 months.

Highly recommend sticking with the severe driving interval, especially if you fall under those conditions. Manufacturers usually allow up to 1 qt of oil burned per 1000 Miles and still consider it normal. If you don't check your oil, you have the chance to run bone dry and still be considered perfectly acceptable.",Hyundai
Yes I did.  Through Hyundai no less.  They replaced my engine after confirming maintenance and that i had it TOWED to the dealership instead of driving it.. something my service advisor advised when i called them.....three months later i got my car back and was reimbursed my rental fees once they fixed it.  So from March 20th 2022-June 4th 2022 they had my car and paid me nothing until July 2022.  Plus my $50 Hyundai service gift card for the inconvenience.,Hyundai

"Awesome! Love that color. Picked up mine in red about two weeks ago, no complaints so far. Speed when you need it, and if you're gentle on the throttle, mileage is not bad at all. I get 33/34 mpg on my commute. I had just under \~ 30 miles on the odometer on mine, but I don't think I'd be too upset at 110, if the car was otherwise in brand new condition. Enjoy the car - I'd suggest taking some time to explore the infotainment system, if you can get past the urge to drive the car once you sit down - it is pretty customizable for what it is!",Hyundai
"The claim deadline is Jan 11, 2025. So if you get hit with a theft before then, you can make a claim (even a second or third claim on the same vehicle).

It does look like anyone who participates in this settlement gives up the right to make any claim related to the TikTok challenge after Jan 11, 2025. So if your vehicle gets stolen on Jan 12, 2025, you'd be shit-out-of-luck. 

That is indeed a major drawback to this settlement. I very much doubt that all TikTok/Kia Boyz thefts will disappear after next January. 

I'm not a class action expert, but in general, I'm not particularly impressed with what the plaintiff lawyers have negotiated here. The $145 million payout cap, and the lack of any provision for compensating future thefts, especially. They gave up too much to Hyundai and Kia, IMHO.",Hyundai

"The overall consensus is my usual response with the vehicles I‚Äôve owned. But they have all been used vehicles not worth more than 10k. 

This is the first time I‚Äôve bought new, the car is only at 8k miles, and it‚Äôs got damage on it. I‚Äôm afraid if I start allowing it to sit there, my standards for care will start to diminish too.  

I appreciate the responses. I‚Äôm going to see if I can get it fixed on someone else‚Äôs dime, if not, it‚Äôll be to take it to a Detailer to get buffed and touch up paint, last resort is to ignore it.",Hyundai
Just glad it wasn‚Äôt inside an attached garage while everyone was sleeping. This could be so much worse.,Hyundai
Ya the consumption test at my service center is $900 by it self which is insane plus $75 for the oil change idk about the cleaning they didn‚Äôt mention anything about that. They also want to see if my carmax maxcare warranty will pay for the consumption test but I doubt it cause they don‚Äôt even pay for diagnostics,Hyundai

Just go to the dang dealership and buy them‚Ä¶,Hyundai
Hyundai Prior Approval process for engine replacements specifically states Hyundai will not pay for a rental. Not all warranty repairs entitle the customer to a rental. Most dealers are also months out on engine replacements and do not have the rental inventory to give cars to everyone even if they could. I won‚Äôt put a customer in a rental for repairs that will take more than 30 days.,Hyundai

Even when it says it is still in 6th gear? It does not show that is has downshifted and returns to regular rpm when letting go. this is in all gears so if I‚Äôm at 2nd gear 3k rpm and I ease the throttle it will still jump up and then climb,Hyundai

"They don‚Äôt tell you this and most people don‚Äôt know or understand about the update, is that the update adds the ability to arm and disarm the alarm system by using the physical key in the key hole on the outside of the doors to lock and unlock it. This is so in case if you‚Äôre key fob battery dies or stops working for whatever reason, you won‚Äôt be stranded. People are taking advantage of this feature by putting something in the keyhole to send the disarm signal so they can do this. Or they can be using some device to mimic the signal.

"Since you're constantly believing that your negative cable is an issue....is it loose? If so, ensure the cable is tight around the negative battery terminal. If it's tight, you do not need to keep jiggling it. If it's still loose with it tightened, try using a pair of pliers and squeeze the clamp of the cable. (Possible that it was spread apart during a previous battery replacement).
 
If your battery cables are tight and you're still having issues. Replace the alternator. The battery light indicates the battery is not being charged (due to bad alternator), losing power steering is also a sign of bad alternator as it provides the power for it to function. O'Reilly battery test also confirms this as battery should read 13-14V if it's being charged by the alternator. Recommend going with OEM alternator or name branded aftermarket like Denso which is the OEM supplier for reliability reasons. This should fix most of your issues. Lights dimming is only a good check if you already have a weak battery. Since you replaced the battery and still have a bad alternator, it won't be long before your new battery is completely drained because it's not getting charged. Stop driving around with the battery light on, or you will be stranded somewhere when your new battery is fully drained. Just because your car drives fine, does not mean it is fine.",Hyundai

"Tire warranties cover only manufacturing defects. But that's if you buy a new tire yourself. Most tire manufacturers don't cover OE tires. Hitting a pothole is not covered on any warranty except if you purchased road hazard with new tires. Unless your dealer somehow offered road hazard when you bought your new car, but that's a separate thing between you and the dealer. But then again even if you did buy road hazard, the terms and conditions of road hazard can vary and may not cover pothole damage. In the US, potholes that cause tire damage can be reported to the city or state for reimbursement. 

Tire sealant kit is intended to plug up a slow leak from a nail or screw that poked into the tread. Hitting a pothole causing an immediate flat incidates a larger hole or tear that the sealant is not meant to fix, therefore it'll leak. This again won't be covered by warranty because it's was never designed to fix this issue to begin with.

Therefore, your only options are to pay for a new tire. Buying from Hyundai will be more expensive than a tire store, and buying a new tire sealant bottle to replace the one you used. None will be covered by warranty which is correct.",Hyundai

"The manual says ""87 or higher"".  This means the MINIMUM octane to use without damaging the engine is 87.  If the engine in its most optimal state were truly when using 87 octane, the manual would state ""only use 87 octane"", but it' doesn't say that.  Manufacturers like having that minimum because it helps sell the car.  They would love to have higher octane requirements for these higher compression engines because they could eek out more efficiency and power, but they use the computer to adjust accordingly.

Bought another brand (box store recommended) and hated those too. Put back in the old plugs, smooth.

Then bought the dealer plugs, zero issues. If I only bought them from the start, it would have been cheaper.

Changing plugs on a 4cyl is not bad, the Nissan V6 back-bank not bad either, but some V6's or 4's (Subaru) is a PITA.

First two winters I had normal bulbs and it would do it and my bulb would burn out every time. I was changing a bulb every week because of this. Never happens when it warms up outside.

As long as the ignition is disassembled, you could test it, btw. Lock the car, wait a minute, then try to start it with the usb trick. If it starts, then the update failed. (The update works on my car, but it‚Äôs totally possible that some updates were not installed correctly.)

Unfortunately, the theft settlement provides very little reimbursement for rental car expenses (up to $250 for all transportation expenses resulting from a theft or theft attempt). And best case, you wouldn‚Äôt see that money until spring of 2025.

"Check your oil every other tank of gas. GDI engines consume oil,  fuel also contaminates the oil and dilutes the oils effectiveness. Because the oil becomes dillueted by fuel you want to change the oil between 3500-5000 miles. 

I have had to add oil before 3000 miles, if I waited to 7k and never checked it, it would have been a qt low. 

I pay for my change at 3500K - free change 7500K. Any GDI engine owner regardless of manufacture needs to be aware of oil consumption and oil dilution potential of all engines. 

Avoid quick change oil places, they have to meet a quota and are more likely to make a  mistake. Even the dealer,  check the oil level immediately, and after driving a bit. There are way too many stories of, no oil, filling oil on top of old oil, doubled oil gaskets or leaking oil pan plugs, which the oil will check ok after changing but after a short drive you will be low or out of oil.

I check my oil when I get home after every other tank. I set a timer on my watch for 10 min, check and top off as needed. I usually just top off every time because its always a few dots low. That way if I happen to miss one it isnt the end of the world.",Hyundai

"But if it isn't tuned to use any higher octane than 87, then it will not tune itself for higher octane fuel. It will just suffer through it as best it can. 

They don't have that much compression because they have GDI. Gdi negates the higher compression when it comes to octane in fuel. If it says regular, it requires regular. It won't explode by running 89 or 93, but there is nothing positive happening with that fuel in there, just negative. Like less power and more carbon buildup, which newer cars don't need any help with. They run poorly enough as it is, even on the correct fuel. 

These are just facts, you can explain it to yourself any way you want. But the fact is that premium fuel is harder to burn unless you have a true performance engine that is built and tuned to use premium correctly.",Hyundai

"Yep, the teenagers trying to steal cars that are not actually vulnerable is a real problem. That's one reason why I probably won't get a newer Kia to replace my current one.

I'm not sure what to make of updated cars getting stolen. Mine could not be stolen. They tried; the USB cable was basically still in the ignition. Car never started.

The update only works if you lock your car. So Kia/Hyundai, of course, believe that updated cars getting stolen is because owners didn't lock their cars. I myself am perfectly willing to believe that dealers botch the installation sometimes. 

To some extent, we're all at the mercy of stupid 15-year-old boys and their capacity to learn, or control their destructive impulses, or resist the siren song of TikTok. Speaking as a former 15-year-old boy, that's a scary thought.

That said, if I got a used one I would run a Seafoam treatment on the crankcase oil a couple times though... if you don't know what I am talking about it's not critical and I don't try to push it on people but I am a firm believer in it, but not running any other oil  additives over time, just for specific things (like a sludge cleaning).",Hyundai

Did you need to pay for an expensive diagnostic test, or did they refund you the cost of that once they confirm the engine was bad‚Ä¶?",Hyundai

Hyundai has come a long way since the 2000s. I remember in HS riding around in my buddies Elantra in the early 2000s. No one wanted a Hyundai and a Kia was even worse. A time when Suzuki or Mitsubishi was prized more to have. Now Hyundai has one of the nicest interiors in the industry. I really like how they are going for the retro futurism look. I really hope Toyota and Nissan follow suit.,Hyundai

Imagine paying 80k for a hyundai....yikes,Hyundai
Did you not get a quote before buying?,Hyundai
Should it be like what?,Hyundai
"It really depends on your individual situation.

People who had serious damage or total losses from a theft, and who were not insured for those losses, can make large claims -- up to 60% of the value of their car. There are probably some people who will have claims of as much as $10,000 approved (but see below for a caveat).

People who had a theft or theft attempt, but were insured, can claim much, much less. (This is my situation, and I expect they will approve about $665 for me.)

People who have had no theft or theft attempt may be able to claim a small amount -- $50 to $300 or so, depending on circumstances. 

The caveat to all this is that the total payout from Hyundai/Kia is capped at $145 million. If approved claims are greater than that amount, everybody's payout will be reduced proportionately to get under the cap. 

My guess -- and it's purely a wild-ass guess -- is that they will approve about $665 of my claim, and I will end up with somewhat less than that after they cut everybody to get under the cap.",Hyundai

"But the dipstick isn't a measure of the ""total amount of oil"" in the engine. It only shows if you are a quart low or not 

https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a28246625/how-to-check-engine-oil/

Step 3: Pull the Dipstick

Pull the dipstick fully out of the tube that it's housed in. It's like pulling a sword from a sheath. Have a rag or paper towel ready and wipe any oil off of the end of the dipstick. At the tip of the dipstick you will see two lines: the lower one indicates that the oil level is one quart low. The upper line denotes that the crankcase (the car's oil tank) is full. Some dipsticks are also marked with words like ""full"" and ""add.""

Step 4: Note Oil Level

Insert the dipstick into the tube slowly and push it all the way down. Now withdraw it and look closely at the tip, which should have oil on it. If the level of the oil is between the two lines, your vehicle has enough oil. If it's at the low mark or below, it's time to add a quart.

Once you've added a quart of oil, wait several minutes for the oil to drain down into the crankcase and and then check it again to ensure that the level is at least between the high and low marks. The oil level does not have to be at the high mark for your engine to have enough lubrication to run safely.

"Well, I think they already changed the cars. My understanding is that for both Hyundai and Kia, all cars made since the 2022 model year, even the base trims, have factory-installed immobilizers, just like other brands do.

There are two other major liability risks for Hyundai/Kia that this settlement does not eliminate. One is lawsuits from municipal and state governments. There are several of those, I believe, seeking many millions of dollars in damages for police costs and community disruption. I guess you could consider that an indirect benefit to regular citizens in the form of reimbursed tax dollars and, in theory, more money for law enforcement and anti-crime community engagement. I try not to give in to cynicism, so I'll just cross my fingers on that. 

The second area is insurance subrogation -- i.e. the effort by insurance companies to make Hyundai/Kia compensate them for some of the money they paid out on behalf of customers like me. Geico paid out $2,300 in my case, for a failed theft attempt. In aggregate, that could be hundreds of millions of dollars. I kind of like the battle of the titans aspect to that -- like Godzilla vs. Mothra -- but it's even harder to see how that helps regular people who were victims of these thefts. But again, trying not to be a cynic over here.",Hyundai

"Actually, gap insurance is entirely about the amount of your outstanding loan. If the loan balance is higher than the car's value, gap insurance will pay the difference in the event of a total loss. It protects you from negative equity -- when you owe more on your loan than your asset is worth. If you make a large down payment on a loan, you probably won't ever have negative equity.

If your car is worth more than you owe on it -- i.e. you have equity in it -- gap insurance is useless to you. You don't have a gap, and gap insurance won't pay you anything if your car is a total loss. Your comprehensive insurance will pay you the value of your car, you'll use a portion of that amount to pay off your loan, keep the remainder, and bob's your uncle. 

You may be confusing gap insurance with replacement value insurance. That form of insurance will pay you enough money to replace a lost or destroyed item (like a car) with a brand new version of it. It's much, much more expensive than gap insurance, for obvious reasons.

Your Elantra Hybrid has the 1.6 Smartstream GDI/MPI engine, and is the naturally aspirated version of that engine.

Like anyone would, I would also recommend you do oil changes in between regular intervals, and keep an eye on oil around the top of the engine where the top plate meets the main engine housing. That's were you might see a leaky valve cover gasket, and that might happen north of 40-50k miles, though it may have already been resolved. 

Keep enjoying your car! My partner has one (Limited) that I insisted they get to replace their absolutely terrible Sentra, and after a year and almost 20k miles, they're doing great and still pushing 50mpg despite them driving sometimes quite aggressively!",Hyundai

Oil finds their way. Usually holding some metal particles and shorts it out and you'll be damn surprised. There's about 20 different com systems connected to a speed sensor sometimes you can short out all the systems connected to it.

And nothing's worse than going to a Neanderthal and trying to explain to him that leaky oil pan. I told him about three oil changes ago that he said he had a guy doing it or knew someone.

I changed the oil religiously every 2,000 miles (3,000 km), from new, and it still was not enough to avoid or delay the design / factory generated failure. 

Proving that no good deed goes unpunished,  the engine gave out at 89,000 miles (140,000 km). 

While meeting and exceeding the maintenance schedule helped with my claim for engine replacement, it shows that little can be done to prevent the engine seizure from occurring. 

I am still a bit unclear about the actual cause of the problem. Some sources imply excessive carbon buildup on the valves and piston rings due to the nature of GDI engine design. Others describe poor 'de-burring' process at the factory that left metal shavings in the engine block that clogged oil passages (leading to inadequate lubrication of the crankshaft or connecting rod bearings). 

So were the crankcase journals not de-burred, or were they demurred but the shavings not flushed out?",Hyundai

"As an addendum, here's the language from the settlement agreement pertaining to claims for an amount that the insurance company underpaid.

You can claim reimbursement in ""total loss"" situations, if:

*The Class Vehicle subject to a Qualifying Theft or Qualifying Theft Attempt was declared a Total Loss by an insurer, but the Class member was still not made whole by the insurance payments, as measured by the Black Book value (private party/average condition) minus total insurance settlement/payment received.  Insurance documentation showing the amount claimed and recovered from an insurer is required.  (Settlement agreement, pg. 11)*

*...*

*For each of the above, a Claimant‚Äôs loss will be measured in relation to the Black Book value of a comparable private party vehicle in very average condition. (Settlement agreement, pg. 12)*

Unfortunately, I think this precludes any arguments about the condition of your vehicle. They are going by ""very average"", with no room for argument. You can, of course, insist that they include any options you had on the vehicle that increased its value.",Hyundai

"Yeah but that's not low. I understand it's low compared to other rates that you have seen. But the issue is that overall the rates have increased and not just your normal increase because every insurance company raises their rates. It's because of all of the issues that have been going on with Hyundais and Kias with the cars being stolen. You don't even have to have one of the cars that are affected, just because you have a Hyundai or a Kia you're a part of that group of people that are going to have to pay high rates bc u own one. Also, their companies, some that won't even insure them. If you do have one of the cars that are affected and a part of the class action lawsuit as well that just launched, if you ever needed to get your car fixed because of a wreck or anything, it's going to take longer than it would with any other vehicle just because of all the thefts, car is getting react with the thefts, like mine, that means that it's taking a longer length of time to get cars fixed because there are so many plus manufacturing the parts etc. it's just a mess. 

Ppl that think that they are a okay because they have a new vehicle or don't own one of the vehicles affected, need to understand that nobody else thought that they were affected by anything and just had a regular car too. That was until everything came out and started happening. Everyone else drove their cars like la di da too....per usual. 

In my opinion now after I've dealt with what I have dealt with and like so many others, I could never trust getting another vehicle from Hyundai or kia. It's not like they messed up with just one particular year like for instance it's not just 2015 Hyundai Elantra models. It's literally years and years of these Hyundai elantras, and it's not just the elantras it's so many other models and it's the same exact thing with Kia's. That tells you that the company knowing me was doing what they were doing with their cars and you cannot trust a company like that! They are and were completely negligent. How in the heck can they think that they're ever going to get away with explaining how they manage to not include a certain part in all of these cars for darn near a decade? It just doesn't make sense and they cannot make it make sense. The class action lawsuit that they just launched, isn't enough. The money that they are paying out, for the things that do qualify for reimbursement etc, that doesn't include also what people are going to have to deal with moving forward. People think that just because they're getting a software upgrade that it's going to solve the issue. It's not going to. Simply because every single one of these models are not riding around with some gigantic sticker on their car that says "" don't try to steal this car, it will not work because I got the software upgrade""! Lol! Instead, these thieves that want to steal a car and wreck them, just go busting through the windows and ripping and tearing everything out before they find out  and wreck them, just go busting through the windows etc before they find out that the car cannot be stolen. By then, damage is already done at the very least the window being smashed through! Still having to deal with more damage.",Hyundai

If you move the shifter to the left from drive, the car will enter manual mode and stay in there. If you go into manual mode with the paddles, moving the shifter to the left then back to the right should put it back in auto.

For fuel efficiency, as low as possible. The car won't let you shift up if it's too low, and will downshift automatically if you slow down. Generally speaking between 1.5 and 3k rpm. You can go above that for more acceleration but don't keep it there and cruise at 5k.

You can stop in any gear. It will shift back to 1st by itself.

"I have extensive experience carrying out this recall numerous times in the past, although it has been two years since my last completion. Here is a detailed procedure overview from a technical perspective: 

- Begin by opening the hood and disconnecting the battery terminals. Remove the battery and air box (including the filter). 
- Look for a 12mm bolt securing the battery tie down, and 10mm bolts for each terminal. 
- Locate a 10mm or 12mm bolt on the lower front side of the air box to remove it. 
- Unplug the electronic control unit (ECU) and remove the 10mm bolt at the back of it. 
- Another 10mm bolt can be found on the fusebox, which should also be removed. 
- Carefully detach the fusebox from the side and open it up. 
- Identify the red and black wires connected to the anti-lock braking system (ABS). Cut these wires, attach new connectors, and place them in the designated areas at the bottom of the fusebox. 
- It is critical to correctly connect the new wires and insulate them with heat shrink tubing. 
- Securely wrap the old wire ends to prevent any interference. 
- Reassemble the fusebox, install new fuses, and put everything back together in the reverse order. 
- If the ABS sticker displays a specific number, follow the necessary update process. 

It is important to note that any inaccuracies in the procedure may result in noticeable symptoms before any major issues arise, unless the recall was not carried out correctly for some reason. 

I would be interested to learn if any additional maintenance or replacement parts were involved, as there are numerous factors that could have contributed to the issue, possibly even vandalism. I wanted to provide some insights that may be helpful in understanding the situation.",Hyundai

"Your car can only have two key fobs remembered at any point in time, and you'll need the dealer to do the re-programming. 

There was a time in the past where you could self-program a new key-fob yourself if you had a working one in-hand.  A lot of vehicle manufactures disabled this ""feature"" when some enterprising car thieves began buying used fobs and began re-programming them at valet and city parking lots, reading your registration data out of your glove box ... then coming by your house at 3am and driving your car away, with the key fob they programmed a few days earlier.",Hyundai

Alternator replaced and battery light is off. Such a relief.,Hyundai
"The Ioniq is nice. It will be a step down in size from a sonata a bit but nothing huge. But the car itself will be really smooth and comfortable, with fantastic reliability, minimal servicing, and the Ioniq EV is still one of the most efficient EVs to ever be made to this day so maximises the savings potential for fuel costs. 

As long as the car you pick has enough range for your needs all year round, and you have a reliable and affordable place to charge regularly, then you should absolutely go for it. At 2020 it was tight around the time of the facelift model coming out. So it could be either a 28kWh or 38kWh battery. 

The 28kWh still has a really good range, minimal degradation over time, and charges much faster than the newer 38kWh battery facelift. So don't let that put you off if that's what you're looking at, provided your daily distance is well within the range of the battery.",Hyundai
"Car maker must notify NHTSA as soon as a decision is made to recall a car. 
That info is public knowledge and will be on the 6 O‚Äôclock news.
The next morning phones start ringing off the hook at dealerships with customers looking to get their car recalled right the fuck now. The standard dealership response is: A recall on what? As we desperately search the car makers website for info on this recall (which to be honest may or may not exist).
Ordering a recall presents a few challenges. First off a procedure must be written for the inspection/repair. Secondly, updated parts must be designed, sourced, shipped, stocked, and distributed.. (you can't wander down to Auto zone and order oh say 100,000 updated ABS units and say 10,000 engine wiring harnesses.)  Technical bulletins / procedures must be written, tested, cleared by legal and engineering. 
This does not happen overnight. 
Also, the customers and dealers must be notified. Typically the first letter to the customer is to notify them the recall is coming. The first notification to the dealer is the same usually with some info about how to respond to customer questions. One the replacements are available a second mailing is done to notify customers. Some car makers (Hyundai plus many other brands will call customers about recalls)",Hyundai

>The vehicles addressed in this particular recall could develop an internal fluid leak in the anti-lock brake module. This could result in a short circuit leading to overheating and, possibly, a fire, according to the NHTSA.

The recall was supposed to be coming in to get a fuse replaced for the ABS control module, but haven't seen or heard anything more about it... 

And that is a lot of ifs... If a leak occurred and if a short circuit developed and if that caused overheating, it could potentially cause a fire... I am not saying that it isn't real, and that people should get the recall done if/when a fix is announced, but until then you are probably more likely to be struck by lightning while being bitten by a shark or winning the Powerball Jackpot than this causing a fire in your garage.",Hyundai

My daily is a Civic Type R from 2011 with 240bhp is 2900 pounds. Considering your Hyundai is a modern car with all the gizmos i do agree its decently light for a modern car so with a good suspension setup I can see it being a blast to drive daily with all the gizmos.

Recalls are for safety issues not mechanical issues. Sometimes those safety issues are the result of a mechanical failure and they have to fix it but a mechanical issue in on itself is not a reason for a recall.

For instance, if there's an item that just says 'inspect' in the maintenance schedule that gets ignored. But if you go to a good mechanic they will actually inspect brakes, tyres, hoses, pulleys, belts, sensors and everything else. Check all fluids and filters and look for signs of rodents gnawing at cables or stone damage to components.

It's worth getting your car looked at, and taken care of, properly by someone you trust. If you just obsessively change oil while ignoring everything else, eventually you will kill your car.",Hyundai

"I have a Kia, not a Hyundai, but I am going to file a claim under this settlement.

As of now this is a proposed settlement; it has not received final approval from the court, and could be changed, delayed, or canceled.

Second thing to know is that if you own or owned a vehicle covered by this settlement (a ""class vehicle""), you are automatically included (or opted in, if you prefer that language).

If you prefer not to participate, you have to actively **opt out** by May 3, 2024 (you send a letter to the various lawyers). If you do nothing, and then don't file a claim by Jan 11, 2025, you lose your right to any compensation from Hyundai.

As for making a claim, you obviously already figured out that you can claim up to $375 as reimbursement for your deductible. There are a few other small amounts that you may be able to claim. I'm claiming $250 (the max allowed) in lost wages for the time it took me to bring my car in for the software update.

And as you said, you can make a claim for any amount that you feel the insurance company underpaid you. However, the math on that is going to be pretty cut-and-dried. The settlement claims administrator will determine what the value of your car was at the time of the theft, according to the Black Book fair market value. That's the standard they use; it's written into the settlement, and I can't imagine any way that they will use any other value. Maybe you can haggle with them over the condition of your car. Certainly, there's no harm in trying. I would call the claims administrator before I filled out my claim and ask them to provide me with that value, if I were you.

As for opting out, I don't see how that makes sense unless you are willing and able to pursue your own claim against Hyundai individually. Basically, that likely means suing them yourself.

Last thing: the total amount that Kia and Hyundai must pay to people like us who were affected by this is capped at $145 million. If the total amount of approved claims is higher than $145 million, everybody's claim will be reduced proportionately to get the payout under the cap. My claim will total about $665-850, but I'm mentally preparing for my payout to be reduced because of the overall cap.",Hyundai

"WOW, I'm so glad you and your family are safe.

Odd question - did you happen to ever have your car start honking as if you had pressed the panic button, but without having actually pressed the panic button?

My 2016? maybe 2015? Tucson started doing that randomly two or three times a day for no apparent reason while parked in the garage only two days before the engine abruptly blew out while I was driving on the interstate due to an engine defect Hyundai eventually acknowledged, but did not recall.

My Tucson had the same ABS electrical component flaw that can cause the whole thing to go up in flames without even being powered on.

I have often wondered if the panic alarm going off was a sign that a short in the electrical system was soon to cause a fire like the one you experienced, but in my case, it would have happened inside my home garage, directly next to a room with a family member receiving 2 liters of continuous oxygen.",Hyundai
"It probably can, but if you're replacing them to get LED lights, you should really get an aftermarket brand of headlights so you can have resistors for it.

"I would definitely call Hyundai yourself and ask them. I'd also call another Hyundai dealership if you have one in your area and ask them this question as well. As far as I knew, under the warranty, they had to cover a rental or loaner vehicle. The rental age issue, where are you located? Most states, it's 21, and it is handled differently when it's done for insurance purposes. Maybe this would fall under that? 

Also, you likely have to get this fixed to get the most return for your vehicle. Another dealership will not give you anything close to its value without an engine. Hyundai dealership might give you something on a trade in knowing they can fix it under this recall/warranty, but it's really in your best interest to fix the vehicle first and then sell/trade.

"I think the whole dealership model will come to an end soon. I‚Äôm in the market for a new lease and I really can‚Äôt stand going to the dealers. They‚Äôre always trying to pull one off on you, they‚Äôre not transparent about pricing or any of the details on how the payments are being calculated. Not all dealers are like this the majority seem to be from my experience",Hyundai
"Sorry, I can't help much with the transmission, I do know in other makers they start going weird around the 150k miles, but in my case (Subaru Outback) it is going fine, I do have CVT, so we may have different kinds of transmissions. The first number in the oil is how fluid it goes in low temperatures, I live in a cold clima, so I go with 0w. The second number tells you the viscosity at normal operating temperature in the motor, and that is where I went a higher number than the recommended by manual 0w20, which I was doing before. If you live in a temperate clima, you can use higher number in the first number slot. There are videos in youtube that explain this better than me or you could start a new threat in here for that (this threat really is about electric cars, so you are not likely to get many good responses on this).",Hyundai

"I had something similar happen.  I gave my insurance company his name and license plate and they were able to track down his insurance policy and file a claim on my behalf against his policy.  I try to avoid going through my own insurance, but whether you call your company or theirs, it will show up on CLUE and be on your history either way.",Hyundai
I had a good friend who had the same thing happen to his wife but she was on the freeway in downtown Chicago. We decided to get him into a brand new Jetta and he has never looked back,Hyundai

"Generally, at least with my franchise (Not Hyundai) all you would get is the balance of the warranty that's left. We run into situations where say a battery is covered by the manufacturer and it fails a couple times within vehicle warranty, and fails just outside of warranty, even if it's been less than 12 months, it's not covered. Because the warranty of a covered component only applies if you paid for a portion or all of it. 

So, you'd be under the power train warranty for that engine, even if you got it at 99k miles as soon as you hit 100k you'd be SOL no matter if it was a month after install or not.",Hyundai
"The warranty covers manufacturing defects. So unless you can prove that your tire was defective from the factory, then it's not Hyundai fault you hit a road hazard. So yeah, not covered by the warranty.",Hyundai
The update is useless unless you lock it with the fob,Hyundai
"The new cars dont have the same security issue. I have a '23, it doesnt prevent them from being stupid and breaking in thinking it can be stolen though. I keep plastic and tape in my car just for such an event. 

With the number of reports of people still getting their car stolen after the update, more needs to be done. 

There have been some posts where a cover is glued in place to protect the ignition. This doesn't keep them from breaking a window or destroying the door lock.

The big city near me had an event to update everyones kias. They are certainly tired of all the BS.",Hyundai

Ya the surge/lunge it doesn‚Äôt do it a lot but I & my wife has noticed it & I was like maybe it is the a/c compressor turning off or turning on like idk seems to run good & ya I just got the car last month only add coolant once to bring it to full level I‚Äôm going to check oil & coolant tomorrow & I‚Äôll get the best oil,Hyundai
"I‚Äôve seen the power steering light come on just the one time and hasn‚Äôt since.

It‚Äôs on a shim now and there‚Äôs no issues but the battery light stays on. No other lights come on. 

I‚Äôm sure once this issue is resolved the car will last way longer. This car has been GREAT and I‚Äôm trying my best to keep it around for a while. Maybe I like it a little too much, but it‚Äôs been amazing.",Hyundai

Ya it‚Äôs my only car & I do work from home but will put miles on it & I checked my vin shows no open recalls or anything so idk if I‚Äôm covered or not lol it has the engine that has the fault but I‚Äôm not under recall? lol,Hyundai
Most oil sensors on most cars dont come on until theres so little that you're already doing damage. Always best just to check it yourself occasionally.,Hyundai
How do I even tell which one is mine all I know is it‚Äôs a 2.0L GDI engine lol idk if it‚Äôs a theta 2 or a NU. All I know it‚Äôs a 2018 Tucson SEL Plus with a 2.0L,Hyundai
"Interesting! I have had GM and Ford half ton trucks, direct injection, turbo, and towed heavy (10,000lbs) and never had oil consumption.

But I just check and the Ford manual says under extreme conditions 1qt over 500 miles. Surprised the EPA doesn‚Äôt have a hissy fit 

I see your a Hyundai tech so do you mind if I pick you brain a quick second? Does the 1.6T benefit from an oil catch can? I‚Äôll be getting a 1.6T HEV ‚Äò24 Santa Fe as soon as they hit our shores from Korea",Hyundai

"You could change the oil at 5,000mi which is a happy medium between the 3,750mi (Severe Schedule) and 8,000mi (Normal Schedule). I don't like trusting Hyundai/Kia's Normal schedule as they're known for engine issues. So more frequent oil changes doesn't hurt. Older the oil, the less effective the additives are and can lead to engine wear due to old oil acting like fine sandpaper with any dirt and grit. You could argue that you don't fall within the ""driving conditions"" for the severe maintenance schedule, but to me...Oil is cheap, a new engine is not.",Hyundai
"Yeah, not sure if I would take the time to claim the lost wages if I didn't have other valid claims also (about $440 for my insurance deductible and transportation expenses). But since I will file a claim, it'll only take a minute to add the lost wages to it.

I do agree that between the lawyers' bite out of this settlement and the (hard to justify, IMO) $145 million payout cap, reimbursements to actual damaged car owners could be pretty disappointing. My own costs and hassle have been annoying but they haven't harmed me in any meaningful way. If I get nothing, it'll just be angry-making.

But I feel bad for folks whose cars were trashed but they didn't have comprehensive insurance on them. A lot of them lost their means to get to work, or visit loved ones etc., and this settlement isn't going to come close to making them whole.",Hyundai

"I'm sure you can get enough power out of that 1.6 to be on the road and have fun. Just be safe and start with the basic mods, exhaust, lower engine mount, and suspension. The sonata looks good üëç, but I like tuner cars because of one reason that most people overlook because they get sucked into wanting more,more power. your car is supposed to be your ride or die. Every time you add a new mod and walk away from the parklot and look back. (That's my car, and dam, she looks good). But in the end, you do you because you are the one behind the wheel.",Hyundai
"The dealer should have sold you the tire protection warranty with the new car - but sounds like they didn‚Äôt. So, you‚Äôre stuck with the bill.
Tire protection warranty is something I recommend for all new tires. Got it on my latest set of tires, and it more than paid for itself within three months when I drove over a screw.",Hyundai
Depends on the trail,Hyundai
"Did your notice say a fix was available or that they were working on a fix?

We got one recently that said they're still working on a fix and will send a notice when they're solved the problem. And there were some warnings about what not to do while waiting

"Depends on forest roads here and if raining or snowing. Have an older Nissan Pathfinder body on frame still. Only 2wd but decent ground clearance. plus put in more highway 10 Ply Michelin tires as OEM sucked popped even on city roads.
Took it on a back forest road here. Senator highway between Crown King and Prescott. Me and son had started very early when I had a day off during the week and he wasn't in school. Packed plenty of water and lunch and snacks.
Had fun and was nearing the Prescott side but not all the way out. Stopped at a know older general store. Q family started talking to us. Oh they had a city queen 4X4 slight factory lift. Son was talking to their children how much fun he had going over the mountain.¬†
Dad was you won't get much farther as they had to turn around as water crossing up the road. Plus too bad your son won't see what they did as this isn't a mountain yet. Plus leaving late in the day to go further.
Me ok we left early and came from the other direction and leaving now. He saw the mountain and other stuff like more old mines. Why later now. Might even hit dinner in Prescott before interstate back to Phoenix.
But omg no 4X4. Ok it was fairly recently graded. No rain or snow. A rocky not sand shallow water crossing. I endangered my son. Oh didnt tell him but as first stated plenty of water, a filter if needed for not poisonous steams if needed and snack and lunch. Plus a cheap small tent good for the weather everything goes bad.

One day I get a letter from my car finance company and it was my title. Of course I get it friday evening. The whole weekend I had visions that someone had mercy on me and paid the car off. 

Nope, it was a mistake. Still had to pay the loan. üôÑ üòÅ",Hyundai
I love Hyundai and all of their products but who forgets to add a button for the heated steering wheel? That's the silliest recall I've ever seen LMAO,Hyundai
"It's cagey at best. It has one of the engines under recall in it. We got ours with 105k for a grand total of about 25k after financing and service package plus warranty. Bought it in 2021, which was precisely the absolute worst time in history to desperately need to purchase any kind of car. Much less used one. 

We didn't even get 20k miles on it before the piston slap stopped it dead. We had kept up with the regularly scheduled maintenance and had it at a Hyundai dealership before we even made the first payment on it because it had a mysterious knock/tick. Which, I think is the only thing that saved us as far as the factory warranty goes. 

It's been a stressful couple of years with that thing. We're hoping that it will all be worth it after this new engine. Definitely make us feel better about paying new car prices for a 5 year old car. 

Honestly my guy, if you can find and afford something else, might be best for your mental health to take a pass on this one. Having said all that, my recent experience with Hyundai corporate and local dealership has made me give serious consideration to buying Hyundai later down the road when we're ready for and capable of getting another vehicle.",Hyundai

"You didn't lose ""half the oil""  the amount of oil between the ""low"" and ""full"" markers on the dip stick is one quart of oil (your car hold ls *about* 5 and a half quarts of oil) If you lost half the oil your engine would be toast.  
You burned half a quart of oil over 2500 miles, it's probably slightly more than avg but not wildly so.  Add a 1/4 of a quart of oil at a time until it's back to ""full"" and change the oil  (use full synthetic) ever 3-4k miles to be on the safe side",Hyundai
The update is useless since the update when used properly only prevents the ignition key drum (whatever it's called) from unlocking and turning with the key to start.  It doesn't prevent the engine from starting the that key system is removed from the steering column.,Hyundai
