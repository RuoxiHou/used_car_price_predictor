"To my eye, 24' is a much better look, I don't see Audi vibes, maybe a bit of some ≈†koda on the rear. Agree with you that a more powerful/bigger engine would have been nice and automatic gearbox for sure. The market for manuals is going smaller by the day.",Dacia
"There are 3 Automatic Transmissions available on Dacia cars currently. 

**Nissan/Renault XTronic CVT (Sandero/Logan):** Smooth, but longevity is questionable given the poor track record of Nissan/JATCO CVTs. 160,000km should be achievable nonetheless. CVT fluid changes must be done according to spec (at the latest) and using the correct Renault/Nissan CVT fluid. CVTs are very smooth, but some people don‚Äôt like the way they drone at medium RPMs. Ideal for city traffic. 

**Renault (Getrag) 6 Speed Dry Clutch DCT (Duster EDC):** Quite reliable, being a dry clutch unit it needs a bit more care in terms of driving style, and it‚Äôs not best suited to heavy traffic (start/stop). It‚Äôs said to be less smooth than wet clutch EDC transmissions used on higher end Renault models, but not too bad. 

**Renault Multimodal Hybrid Transmission (Jogger/Duster 2024- Hybrid):** The transmission had some early problems in the Clio Hybrid, but these were fixed under warranty. Medium term reliability seems to be good, it‚Äôs only been on the market since late 2020 in the Renault Clio. It‚Äôs a very complicated system from an electronics standpoint, so long term reliability has to be seen. It‚Äôs a very smooth system, but it has a habit of keeping gears very long when accelerating.

Previous:

**Renault Easy-R Automated Manual Transmission (Sandero/Logan/Duster):** To be avoided like the plague, it‚Äôs not so much unreliable, but horribly jerky like most automated manual transmissions (Hyundai AMT, VW ASG, Suzuki AGS). It also has a regular clutch like a manual car that will need to be replaced eventually.",Dacia
I have a 2023 model and must say 2024 looks great. Sadly it will also cost more so I'm just happy I bought duster when I could afford one new,Dacia

"Power storage is not everything, I am sure the market could relatively quickly adapt to replaceable battery modules of different sizes. Yes you lose some space/capacity, however BYD already produces the extremely popular blade battery which technically has less capacity but safety and other reasons weight up this downside. Generally though I think it‚Äôs more likely we get batteries which are cheaper. degrade slower and last for more cycles while also being able to charge them quick. If you have a cheaper BEV for 10 years that would be a good deal, many manufacturers have warranty for 8 years or more (Renault has 8 years). The battery tech in 10 years is going to be so much better/cheaper that it makes sense to get a new car at that point. 

I think it‚Äôs good to try and be realistic and to be skeptical, but also we need to consider emerging technology and think a bit outside the box and have a bit of an open mind. Once they said we humans will never fly, then the weight brothers did just that. Then they said we will never fly over the english channel, then we did just that, then they said we will never fly across the atlantic, then we did just that. Then they said we will never fly into space, and we did just that. So they said we will never go to the moon, yet we did just that; and all in a very short timeframe. Not many years ago they said we would never have self driving cars, now we have that. They also said we might never have AI, now we have that to some degree. The best minds on the AI subject thought todays AI was decades away. These experts now think we will have a singularity sometimes during the 30‚Äôs. Maybe they are wrong once again and it‚Äôs just a few years away. Tech can quickly come which changes everything.",Dacia

"Not a fan of side steps in Duster. They aren‚Äôt really needed to get in while they can make pant legs dirty when getting out and reduce overall clearance. 
Surprised to see wind deflectors as well. Do you have a version without air-con? 

Otherwise, it‚Äôs a 4x4 Duster - looks best when it‚Äôs battered, scratched and dirty :-).",Dacia
"Nice.

In our Sandero we are getting about 42 around town (lots of shorter trips and stop start). On a motorway run with the CC on we managed to hit 70.1 (average) for a while and that overall trip of 600 miles with motorway, town, country and traffic jams ended with a trip computer average of 69mpg and an at the pump average of 66mpg.",Dacia

"Honestly, I'm so sick of dealing with that dealership. They have been causing me nothing but trouble since I bought the car. They've already botched multiple jobs from the outset. It was back and forth for months. I'm tired of dealing with them and I don't trust them. It's Martins of Winchester. I would not recommend buying a car from them. They're very dishonest and have very low standards of work.",Dacia

"Engines, packages are different between countries. It's worth mentioning where are you purchasing your car.

The UK config is a little weird. You definietely get the height adjustable seat on Extreme, it wouldn't make sense to not have it. You can buy mat or alloys on amazon. And you will be likely be using applecar/android auto for navigation anyway. So from the differences you listed it's only the heated seats that really matter. There are however differences that are not clearly mentioned:

1. You can only have cedar green on Extreme, but you are also forced into bronze mirror and accents that look crap on any other color than cedar green.
2. Extreme has microcloud upholstery (compare interiors between the two versions) which is a cool feature for families with small kids. Microcloud is fairly easy to clean.
3. Extreme also has extended grip which helps to get out from muddy terrain. 
4. Extreme has shark fin, which can be purchased as an accessory to Expression. 

Overall, for me it the choice would be down to color and upholstery. 

It's a great car nonetheless. I have it for more than a year and love it.",Dacia
Please upload some pictures when you get it! Great choice!,Dacia
"Best? Depends what you want from it.

"If push came to shove it will be easy enough to check (in a legal sense) what the webpage said on the day I ordered my car, I really don't think that's going to be an issue where they are going to be able to say they've just added that to the spec after I put my order in when I am 100% sure it was already advertised before I went to the dealer.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure where you are, but the laws are pretty stringent in the UK when it comes to advertising.",Dacia
First thing I thought too!,Dacia
"Well, that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm asking. Honestly first of this is the first car I own, secondhand, it did not come with a manual. I live in Sweden, 0 homes has AC afaik, at least not apartments, a afaik most houses in the city has heating from the city, not AC. I just don‚Äôt know these things. Heat/cold comes out of the car no matter if the button is pushed or not. So i am asking, maybe it‚Äôs broken, so that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm asking, because I am unsure about what is normal, so that is why i‚Äôm asking stupid questions, and it pisses me off everyone is so rude about it, saying i am lazy or stupid. This is why people shut up instead of asking things they wonder about, lucky for you that you never ever had to ask any stupid/lazy question in your whole life.",Dacia
"Running a Jogger here and points 5 and 6 happened to me as well.

5. This is a known issue with all these Renault engines. It happens on Clios as well, for example. It's only cosmetic noise but to totally fix it, they need to replace the turbo. The noise comes from a metallic fitter or something like that. My dealership had a semi-fix that reduced the noise to half of what it was. A complete fix would have to come from Renault's engineering before they can deploy it.

6. My dashboard lights once became like a Christmas tree, a lot of light and injection system warnings. That was fixed with an ECU software update. It seems there is a bug within the ""injection calculator"", as the dealership told me, and since that software update half a year ago, the problem never came back.

My Jogger currently has 35000 km.",Dacia
Mic is a plastic thing above driver‚Äôs head. This one is temp sensor.,Dacia
"I couldn‚Äôt care less of the Brand and ‚Äúlook‚Äù as long as it is an affordable and capable 4x4.

I happily would just have the bare minimum in it - like a shell - similar to the Landcruiser 70s series.

The point for me is 4x4

And there‚Äôs practically speaking nothing available in Europe. Someone meantioned the Jimny but it‚Äôs sold out and they only made a few to cater for the really dumb EU regulation which favours big useless luxury SUV‚Äôs that have none of the capabilities they were originally designed for. A SUV is a car that is supposed to have clearance and 4WD. Increasing they are just ‚Äúhigher‚Äù cars with little clearance and no 4x4 capabilities.

The new Duster design simply tells me that this will ultimately be the fate of the Duster aswell.

Hence my comment.

PS some may argue the new Defender is a very capable (expensive) 4x4. And it is. As long as you don‚Äôt run into trouble in the middle of nowhere. The over-reliance on electronics means that you cannot tow the car for more than 10 mins (unless you use a flatbed) . If you conventionally tow it for more than 10 mins (on Neutral) the car will automatically switch to P causing the gearbox to break requiring a total replacement. It actually says so in the manual. Getting a flatbed tow truck into a 4WD area is impossible. Getting that car out would be a ridiculous exercise of towing for 5 mins (just to be sure you don‚Äôt totally break the car!) then waiting and changing gears then towing it for 5 mins again. Just imagine doing that on difficult terrain!! 

And battery systems can totally shut down to the point where you can‚Äôt restart the engine using conventional means.

That alone disqualifies it as a useful car.

On top of it, at that price point, I‚Äôd be scared to scratch it! 90000‚Ç¨!!!",Dacia
"Yeah, I hope the tip from the guy above works, it's the same with me,  the radio works for like a minute or two and then I get a message that it will turn off to protect the battery.  I really hate this, in my previous cars I used to sit like that for hours and listen to radio without any issues.  First time I got a car without a key and this has been a struggle, today I just wanted to charge my phone without turning on the engine and it pissed me off",Dacia
"Automatic folding mirrors are an optional extra you pay for, you didn't pay for it so its not there.

Manuals cover everything that car can have normally so they can print 1 version and stick it in every model of that car",Dacia
"> they're not your typical auto gearbox and are more complicated and hence have a higher tendency to break.

Other way around. CVT is the most simple and cheapest variant of automatic transmission, that's why they are used in cheap cars.

It was beautifully shown in the Audi A6 C7 - the basic entry-lever versions had CVT, the middle versions had DCT and only the top-of-the-line versions got torque converter.

DCT's are faster and CVT's provide better mpg. But the main reason why manufacturers abandoned torque conververs is their complexity and price, even though they are the most reliable and comfortable.",Dacia
No because they're crap and I wouldn't touch a Duster with a barge pole!!!,Dacia

"I think I may have fixed it. I removed the light fitting and pushed some little squares of sound insulation foam into the space above the liner. I also carefully pulled a bit of the liner away around the door frame and did the same thing. I can't hear that rattle anymore, based on my test drive... But now I have a new rattle from the driver's seat somewhere. üôÉ",Dacia
"Father of two kids here, yes. Upgraded from golf when youngest was born. Duster easily has enough space for a stroller and a lot more if you like tetris. If you remove trunk top cover you can fill it even more. I plan to get topbox to have place for event more stuff when we go camping and stuff.  
I did consider jogger for a while so that trunk space if not even an issue, but duster made more sense on bad roads in my country",Dacia

"Re p.1 faulty LPG level indicator was a common problem last year here in Poland. Local dealership was replacing it with a new one.

"It should. We live in France and we got ours with the bars (2021 Duster) during a sale. You should be able to find it on the Dacia website - look for accessories or the webstore for accessories. 

I think we got the 480L. It‚Äôs good, the latching mechanism to open the box is a bit wonky if you try to open it without having it on the bars - but you get used to it.

The reason I'm pointing you towards this is there's ton of information and videos online on 'how to drive a manual' but depending on the sort of learner you are those cars are not YOUR car and having someone observe you and give real feedback on your motions can be infinitely more helpful.

Jokes beside, for my budget and my country, I could buy the Sandero or the Fiat Panda. Honestly, I like Sandero way more, but maybe if I add some money I could buy a Clio, or a Corsa, something better. I don't know if it's worth it or would be more smart simply buying the Dacia and keep my money. It's ok for me if the manufacturer has saved on non-essential aspects of the car.

Electric vehucles *are* a problem because they can‚Äôt be made cheap. They also aren‚Äôt a car to use for 15 years. Especially those with small batteries that may see more charging if used a lot.

But I agree with other regulations that are becoming unsensible, like some regulating institution wants to show they are still relevant and because all the bases have been covered invent the need to have less relevant systems obligatory. This jacks up prices and makes vehicles less attainable.

The reason that the Dacia Spring and Duster are going upmarket and becoming more expensive is that more and more electronic assistance systems are becoming mandatory.

"Short answer is good
Long answer...LPG consumtion 350km-450km (city-highway)so 7-8 highway,in city bumper to bumper at 15 km/h average speed 11L...this is the worst i can get it with short trips(2-3km)...but is cheaper ...from this you can get as much as 2L lower on petrol...yes highway 5L/100km is doable
Feeling is good ...is not a sport car but is nice ,no problems for now after 13k km ...is a car that on the economy side is excelent...on the driveing side you can decide on a test drive ,the interior quality is ok,funcional ,the trunk is kinda small if you want to go on vacation with 4 people and want to take the house with you...but you can get the roofbox ,the bars are super nice and easy to change ....

USB cable is 1M long, I found that was just enough neatly tuck along the dash with some slack for attaching the phone. 1.5M is probably better if you want to be able to take out the phone and use it while attached but since I am driving I don't need that option, I connect the phone when I get in the car and don't touch it again until I get out of the car.

"This isn't a tip specific to Dusters but petrol in general, you will need to give it some gas to get it going at times.

Find somewhere quiet to practice brining the revs up to like 1.5k and holding it there, then you can just release the clutch like you normally would. Even with the handbrake you are literally doing all these steps but just disengaging your handbrake at the biting point, you can even let the car pull forward a little bit before disengaging (useful for when on steep hills and you want to make sure you aren't going to roll back). Listen to the engine though, if it's screaming, you are giving it way too much, at most you will only ever need 1.5-2k revs to pull away on even a steep hill. 

If it's stalling, you need to be giving it a bit more but learn to recognise when the engine is about to stall, then you can give it a bit more or dip the clutch and stop the stall.

When you first pass, there is still absolutely loads to learn and part of this is now having the freedom to go out and do it in your own time. Enjoy your new car!",Dacia

Eyeballing it it seems like the Duster 2nd gen is about equal in front and second row space as for instance a Hyundai i30 or KIA Cee'd (but since they're estates they probably have a bigger boot). 

In our used car market, it seems that in order to get that extra bit of space in the back row while retaining boot space, a Volvo V60, Volkswagen Passat or Skoda Octavia is the next step up, but it comes with more miles for the same money.

2) the (lack of) dampening is 50% of the sound performance. Even if you put only a little of the cheapest stuff in, it's going to make a difference in a car that doesn't have some dampening already. Because right now your speakers don't have a good back board, the sound bounces into a shitty thin metal sound box on the back side distorting and worsening its performance.

"Turbo issues are a general issue on most of the Renault build engines. I never owned a Dacia, I drove one tough, but it seemed to me to be a really simple car, and quite decent for the money also. However I used to own so far lots of cars with either Renault engines on them or be be a Renault brand, and from my experience with this brand was that you could either: 1. Have lots of electrical or weird computer problems or 2. Problems related to turbo or egr. The true is that most of the time these problems were cheap and fast to fix, which for me was a plus side. Many other brands (not all) are way more expensive with those issues (eg. German cars).

Actually i just sold my Qashqai j11 a few days a go, which had a 1.5diesel engine, brilliant engine‚Ä¶ until started took engine oil more than diesel. Even tough that I maintained the car as per book said. But I hammered in it 50k miles/year in the past 3yrs. So yeah.. they‚Äôre deffo not very good at endurance/durability. I doubt that the newer Renault engines would do better. 

My personal advice would probably be to look at Suzuki options. From the cheap car market producers they‚Äôre by far the best you can find on many levels. At least from my personal experience. I own a Swift 08 plate from 5+years now, and I swear to God, is the best most fun, cheap and reliable car I ever had.

"Another thing that I'm not sure about as I can't seem to find much info about is the accelerator pedal.

Is it a ""two stage"" accelerator - I push my foot down,  it meets some resistance near the bottom, and then I can push it down right to the floor.  Not sure if I'm describing this correctly.  It's not catching on anything inside the vehicle.

My salesman unfortunately does not seem to know that much about the car he sold and he just said that was right (after first saying maybe the carpet is sticking!).

I mean, it feels OK and kind of makes sense that it's limiting you a bit from booting it and when you go past the ""notchy"" bit the car does boost to some extent.

There are other posts on pistonheads going back to 2014 talking about how the model then DOES have a two stage pedal so I'm really not sure about this - the one and only thing in the manual is about ""exceeding the limit speed"" if you have the speed limiter on and it mentions about pushing the pedal ""beyond the resistance point"".

Not sure if I should make a new post about this, but just want to make sure the pedal is as it should be.

"Any diesel fuel, even the ‚Äúagricultural‚Äù or heating oil, meets european diesel standards and won‚Äôt cause problems in the 1.5 diesel, even the post 2018 ones with scr and euro6 norm. 
It‚Äôs more of a question where you buy it and how the gas station/seller stores it.

You would benefit from specific additives like the mannol range for diesel if you use heating oil/non-taxed diesel, but generaly you shouldn‚Äôt see any problems. 

More problems arise from short low rev drives when the engine doesn‚Äôt heat up or the DPF can‚Äôt complete the regeneration cycle. This engine needs a druve on the open road with sustained speeds over 80km/h with already warmed up engine at least a couple of times per month. 

Low rev rides also cause EGR valve to get stuffed. Both are general modern diesel problems. 

I‚Äôd also invest in the EGR checked and cleaned. You don‚Äôt know if the former owner did it or how they drove the car. For DPF to be sure it‚Äôs regenerated I‚Äôd do a longer high speed trip. 

An oil change wouldn‚Äôt hurt too. If it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúblueDCi‚Äù version with 115 HP it‚Äôs a RN17 5W-30  C3 spec oil, and even RN17FE 0-w20 C5. But you‚Äôd probably be better off with the RN17.

The ONLY rational reason to buy a Duster is for 4x4. And so the design should be made for the 4x4. 

But it increasingly isn't - it's trying to increasingly look and behave like a roadster - just higher up. 

There is some real life practical drawbacks in the design. 

For one the approaching angle is far worse on the 2024 than the old one meaning it is less capable in 4WD application. the engine also has 30 Nm less torque again a drawback in 4WDing

So yeah - now you can have a car that you personally might think looks better but it has less space than the Jogger, and is less capable than the 2023 model.",Dacia

In the case of the Spring the car costs only 7000$ in China, at least for the original model. But was sold at over 20k‚Ç¨ in some markets, because there was simply no competition in the small EV market. As for the case of battery degradation, it‚Äôs not a big problem for cars with bigger batteries of course because the cycles are much lower for the same mileage. But LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) batteries are both much cheaper, use less rare materials and last far longer than traditional NMC cells as used in the Spring for example. At the cost of lower energy density, leading to a heavier car for the same capacity. This is the technology that the E-C3 uses, with almost double the capacity of the Spring and a much bigger car for 23k‚Ç¨.",Dacia

I have replaced it with a 2015 Volvo XC70, and boy is it quieter! The baby sleeps 20 min more on average in the Volvo, just because of the lack of noise on our usual 130km mostly highway route.

"That‚Äôs exactly my criticism. The Duster should be about 4WD and not SUV ‚Ä¶ in actual fact the only purpose of a raised car with less size inside really is 4WD. So SUV should always have a 4WD option. Except they don‚Äôt. Duster was an exception in Europe.

And the Duster was really quite capable as a 4WD - that‚Äôs what made it great.

If the Duster is no longer about 4WD then why is there even a Sandero ? 

The new design basically is a üñïto what made it great.

Not only have they chosen not to improve what needed improvement, by the looks of it they made it worse and also are making it quite clear that they don‚Äôt care about the nerds that supported the Duster so far. 

It reminds a bit of when Apple dropped all useful connectivity on their pro laptops and then pros had to carry a dongle for everything. Apple backtracked after 7 years - but don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever get a Duster again that will be made to be a good 4WD car. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong even the new one will be okay ‚Ä¶ but the direction is clear now. And that is sad.

In Europe if you want a capable 4WD as a co Sumer you only ever had the Duster. Or you are paying a bomb for an electronics focused Defender or something which OTT in cost and actually terrible in terms of reliability (you can‚Äôt tow it for more than 10 mins otherwise you break the gearbox - if you tow it for longer you need a flatbed - that sort of silliness).

Second issue is that the automatic gearboxes are CVT which are known for being unreliable and overall shitty, they're not your typical auto gearbox and are more complicated and hence have a higher tendency to break.  

Overall it's not a good idea to get an automatic Dacia unless you have money and won't care if the gearbox can break after a few years.

"Of course it has everything to do with 4WD.

The only purpose of a Duster is the 4WD. 

Why would you even consider a 4x2 Duster?? The Jogger is about the same length and width (3cm longer), has more internal space, and has almost the same clearance (1-2cm lower). 

There is no good reason to buy a car that has less space inside for the same volume unless it serves a purpose... 

And the purpose of the Duster - and only purpose is that it is 4WD capable.

All other arguments would be simply about personal preferences and optics. There is no rational reason apart for 4WDriving to buy a Duster. 

And in terms of 4WD the new Duster's design has some real drawbacks - lets go a bit deeper: 

- The approaching angle is very questionable, Duster 3 has 31\* at the front and 36\* at back vs 30 and 33 on the Duster 2 - the lower the better. So the Duster 2 is much better (that's the fatness at the front you can see it with you bare eyes - the design is to make it more of a sportswear and you can see it - the point though, it's not a sportscar - its 4wd too different application !) 

- We only have one engine left for the 4WD and the specs are not promising.  It has 30Nm less than the 1.3 TCE 150  - so to have the same off-roading experience you need to pack at least 10% lighter

- The number at the front will just brack at any impact - now even the old one would require some plating of serious 4WD - but the new one basically nothing is usable 

The one thing the 3 has for it is a classic parking brake - given it isn't automatic that will be helpful.",Dacia

"Yes, this is it.

Although tjat would be a departure from Dacia way too. Dacia sabes on gimmicks like infotainment and materials that are fancy but demanding for upkeep but delivers in a ‚Äúcar‚Äù department. Seems loke EV isn‚Äôt an arena where they can compete in the same way they did. And I can understand why. Battery Eav technology isn‚Äôt good. It is forced upon us to accept it as a worse alternative because it cannot be cheap and plainly isn‚Äôt a good alternative to ICE based vehicles. It could have its place though for those that have their own house where they can charge it and for errands about town/workplace. But a forced replacement of ICE via bannng sales of new ICE cars or maling fuel impossibly expensive by banning dyno fuels or limiting sales of it or taxing it punitively - that will mean the end of Dacia and the end of affordability of peraonal mobility. Dacia comes out of the cwntury of carmaking and is ‚Äúback to the basics‚Äù brand that does very very tried tech and principles for a no-nonsense cars. Using amortised parts from the group it can be a cheap car. In EV arena it can struggle to do what it males it great.

"Yeah todays driving schools will teach you more on how to pass thw test then how to drive. Not using your gas to start is very bad, not teaching you how to use handbrake to start is expected bxos you cant pass your test if you use it to start but is very usefull in day to day so kinda dumb not to show the trick. 

1.0 is not diesel obviously so you can rev it a bit higher and shift higher,  and depends on the engine but lower rpm like it would be normal on diesel, lets say 1500rpm and engine could be a bit jerky if trying to accelerate bcos of lack of torque. This is very bad for small engines, avoid it. Downshift, more rpm more power. Those engines have timing chain that should be changed more often then its in the manual, also dont fail to change oil in proper intervals.

"I've converted my last four  4x4s to LPG, at the time, there were a lot more garages that sold it. we've none around us currently. Also, you can't take LPG on the Eurotunnel , and as we are now retired, we travel as much as we can. As for the Duster, we saw loads in France and Spain over the last few years, liked what we saw, so went with it, no regrets at all, hope you enjoy yours.",Dacia
">From new, on cold engine, the car either jumps ahead or almost stalls. It is jerky to a point that it is very hard to start driving. Sometimes, it is fine and very pleasant to drive. Totally random. It happened also that the car started jerking when accelerating and then stalled, like it ran out of fuel. It then started normally and i was able to drive away, angry but unscathed.

That's (sadly) normal behaviour. Either let it idle longer, or give it more gas. Too many people are underrevving these engines.

>Since new, the electric windows randomly do not work. The only exception is the driver's window. It seems to be an electrical problem, because sometimes the door side switch moves the window (but the master switch does not). It seems that the problem is more common in cold and damp weather.

Some of window mechanisms has to be replaced. Generally the driver's one.

>The engine gives of a metallic rattle, which is especially audible at low speeds in parking garages, especially when driving downhill and engine braking. It seems to be related to the turbo wastegate. Sounds like metal clanking to metal, having too much wiggle room somewhere...

"Hey just curious, I have the same engine why do you need to replace it?",Dacia
"When I say 4x4 it‚Äôs not just about the engine and transmission. The design is also relevant for physical needs such as departure angles.

All that said you could either expand the Sandero / Spring to have bigger versions. 

Or you could split the Duster in two different designs.

That would be fine and actually that would be a great solution. Why not make a (more expensive) but really 4x4 focused Duster ‚Ä¶ That would be ultra cool.",Dacia

"I understand your argument but doubt it. There is a limit to how cheat the batteries can get. There‚Äôs still a lot of mining and material gathering involved that doesn‚Äôt seem to have mich space to cheapen. At least with current chemistry and I‚Äôm not aware of any feasable different prospectives on the horizon. Maybe diferent battery management software can live adapt power draw from them but that‚Äôs it regarding longevity. I personaly can‚Äôt buy this progressivist argument that technology necessarily moves forward in every field. Tech could move forward but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll happen in batteries. I think we can look forward to minor improvements here, but price will remain relatively high in improved battery packs. 

And that still doesn‚Äôt address the power grid from where they‚Äôll charge. Higher total electricity consumption plus electricity transport network and grid issues are still unresolved and mean massive investments that cinsumers will have to absorb on top of everything. Combine that with the irational push for renewables that are a problem for grid stability themsleves, plus governmental push for heat pumps (I also use one in my home), this is moving in the direction of a perfect storm. I fear of energy poverty and lesser availability of private personal mobility and I fear that won‚Äôt sit well with the people. And that fuels populist parties - eg. German example. 

Open mind is good, always. Strong social experimentation on the other hand isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd have zero problems with BEVs if they weren‚Äôt mandated in near future because replacement of vehicles (done in the way it is planned) will drag with it wider problems (car mechanics are getting scarcer already for example) and what I see are aocial inplications that we cannot foresee but seem dangerous to me.",Dacia
Its quite loud crunch and it only happens occasionally its the same sound cars make if you try to put into gear without clutch. Mine is 2022 sandero 3 with 28k km. Bright side is it has not made the sound in couple days now. It was for sale for 6 months so maybe was just lack of use.,Dacia

"Yeah, I am sure there is probably a way. If not even a very easy way to make a button that starts the camera as you said i also imagine a switch that's ""clicked"" when you put the lever in reverse.    I'm sure they didn't put a button on purpose so either idiots don't break the camera somehow and then complain to the service, or so the car doesn't feel too premium since it's a Dacia and they don't want to give us too many extras for a smaller price or something.   At least that's how I explain it now, after reading the comments here.  
A similar, albeit bigger thing is how they don't make all of the models 4x4 and that's exclusive only to the most expensive one.  My Journey has almost every extra apart from the 4x4 which sucks pretty badly.  
Or how the lpg models don't have automatic gearbox and so on.  They made it pretty tricky and we had to really think about what version to buy.
Now when I think about it - another thing I hate is how you don't have momentary consumption on LPG  but I'll stop since I'm going way too off-topic. Still at least we have some buttons like the one that turns off automatic engine shutdown, some other brands I tried didn't have such an easy way to turn off that feature.

"They keep a 4x4 option, but it uses the mild hybrid engine (1.2 three cylinder 130HP TCe engine), that is as best, a engine for city and plain roads. Is very far from the performance of the DCi and the 1.3 four cylinder 150HP TCe engines used in the actual 4x4 Dusters.",Dacia

A: Either people need two cars, or 
B: People have one car but for whatever reason is getting rid of it and looking for a new, cheaper car, and that they need a cheaper car for a range of personal reasons which is irrelevant. 

For me personally I had a really good leasing contract from my work, the contracts ends this spring. And my company has gotten rid of the good contracts to save money during these harder times. Therefore no new nice car if we don‚Äôt want to pay twice as much and full price. So we are getting a Dacia for some time, for a couple of months we will therefore have two cars also.",Dacia

"Ssangyong Korando costs more or less the same, and offers more equipment and noticeably better manufacturing quality. Realistically, the only reason to buy Duster 4x4 these days is slightly higher clearance. Which needs maybe 1 buyer out of 10.

Suzuki Vitara costs also the same money as Duster. 

Not to mention that Ssangyong also makes Tivoli 4x4, for 4500‚Ç¨ less than Duster. There are also smaller Suzuki's. 

Dacia needs to step up the game with the new Duster. The days of Duster being the cheapest 4x4 are long gone, and so are the days where Dacia could downplay the subpar quality by ""it's cheap"". 

They need to offer more while keeping the price the same.

Don't get me wrong, Duster still is competitive, especially the LPG version is unmatched if you seek to minimalize the running cost and for some reason need a SUV. But the 4x4... not worth it.",Dacia

I've had two dusters.  First was a 2015 dusters from new to 2020 and the only thing I needed to do was replace the front springs. It was the 2wd version and I wasn't very kind to it. No issues at all. Took a year out with a new Citro√´n c4 Cactus which was horrendous.  Door handles stopped working, rear window was loose, engine faults, the screen took up to 5 minutes to start working.  After less than a year I traded it for a new 4wd duster, which I have now had two years with no (major) issues. 
Minor issues: paint at rear door required to be redone after it had cracked. Fuel gauge would read higher than the amount of fuel, although the fill fuel light came on anyway. Both fixed under warranty. 

Really like the car. Will probably replace with a Duster EV when they become available.",Dacia

As I said at least the Dacia was fairly basic but now it‚Äôs increasingly trying to become another VW.

Edit: and you know what; if the Landcruiser 70s series was available to buy then I wouldn‚Äôt care ‚Ä¶ but EU legislation just pushes as a continuous flow of useless SUV‚Äôs - most of them just cars with ground clearance and no 4WD capabilities - rather than supporting small cars for the masses and very utilitarian 4WDs for those who actually appreciate what 4WD and ground clearance is for. 

The Duster has A single 50% 4WD option without an Auto Gearbox - but also missing diff locks and a powerful engine.

">It is supposed to spray and burn the soot in dpf via the 5th nozzle and fan does something while this is going on.

You're right - this happens ONLY while the engine is turned on. 

Why ? Because the regeneration must be supervised !

Why ? Because you're forcing the engine to produce a very high temperature on the exhaust and if something goes wrong, it might start a fire, might burn somebody passing near the rear nozzle etc.

Think about this situation - you drive home, park the car inside the garage and the car is still doing the regeneration, inside the closed garage. Practically, if it's how you say, you wouldn't be allowed to park it until the process is finished because you will intoxicate yourself. Or even better, you park, keep the garage door open so the gases go out, get inside the house and at some point, some malfunction appears and the car starts a fire. Because we're talking about pumping fuel and lighting it up in order to produce heat. Practically, you wouldn't have a kill switch (in this case, turning off the engine).

That's why even if you force a regeneration via the diagnostic job, inside a workshop, you need to have somebody supervising the process. You don't just turn on the engine, connect the diagnostic tool and leave it unsupervised.

Three times I've had to go back to the dealer in the week I've had it just because I want to make sure they know what's going on as they weren't acknowledging my emails.

I don't know if you are in the UK, but the good thing is, if I give them the chance to fix it, instead of getting my money back, then they've had their one chance to make it right and I'll have the first 6 months where I can then return it if it doesn't look like it should.

I don't expect them to be able to do anything about the couple of marks under the paint on the bonnet - are they going to take the whole bonnet off and respray it?   Goodness knows what it would look like after that, I'm not wanting to end up with an orange peel effect.

My main issue is the tints I have to say, the car is not as advertised, and there is no way I'm having them taking the doors etc to bits to fit the right windows, that'll be a creaking fest for ever after that and I do intend to keep the car for some time, which is why we bought it outright and new - I didn't intend to end up with a Frankenstein car.

It's funny that Renault didn't do the ""fix"" that VAG Group did with their petrol engines (TFSI) - write in the user manual that it's a completely normal phenomenon to loose 1L at each 1000 km. Basically, at each revision, you don't need anymore to change the oil because it's brand new !",Dacia

Depending on your kids age, you may be able to out all the kids in the second row, like I did, but the only way I was able to do that was by using a narrower stoll for the oldest and she sits next to the door. That way the youngest is more protected in the middle seat and I can easily access the third row for more people.

Don't forget to repeat this mantra when you are replacing the injectors before 100k km. Or the entire fuel system after you filled it from the jerry can with biodiesel you found in the garage.

Fun story: A contruction company nearby bought ""agricultural/bio"" diesel. Before they realized it's bad, it ruined an excavator, dumper truck, two vans and a Duster. 19,000‚Ç¨ in repairs.

Farmers buying modern diesel cars, just so they can cheap out on fuel, is evergreen of the last years. And it keeps on giving.

>More problems arise from short low rev drives when the engine doesn‚Äôt heat up or the DPF can‚Äôt complete the regeneration cycle. This engine needs a druve on the open road with sustained speeds over 80km/h with already warmed up engine at least a couple of times per month.

I understand this topic is about Qashqai, but I've never seen Dacia with failed DPF. Well, except the guy who drove for 5000 km and half a year with the warning light on, turning a 150‚Ç¨ repair into 1500‚Ç¨. Even people who used them mostly for less than 10 km trips. Zero issues.

>Low rev rides also cause EGR valve to get stuffed. Both are general modern diesel problems.

Again, doesn't happen on Dacias. I've seen one or two leaking EGR coolers, but that's it.

"The latest models are great cars for what they are. Robust plastics you don‚Äôt have to worry about, practical, nice finish, no crickets from the construction while driving. The 4x4 diesel is reasonably powerful and can be very frugal on regular roads uf yoy dobt force it, but doesn‚Äôt get very thirsty even if you do. The entertainment ststem NeduaNav is basic but functional, no ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù. Ut has wireless carplay and androud auto, and also built in bluetooth functionalities for making calls or navigating (with 3 years of free maps updates) if you dob‚Äôt want to use phone mirroring for any reason. And that at the same time is what all of the car is about. If you, like me, value and take enjoyment from that fact - than you‚Äôll love it.

There are some things that aren‚Äôt perfect as they are, though. 
- Seats are comfortable and all but could be firmer. In bottom position adjustment the driver‚Äôs seat feels like it has a little play. The fron passenger seat in its back most position produces a sound when driving if nobody‚Äôs sitting on it. Moving it one notch forward stops the noise.
- the rubber door seal in the front most part tends to get punctured by the edge of the door when they close. Something they‚Äôll have to sort during warranty period and I already showed it to the mechanic.
- the windows can‚Äôt be opened or closed if the engine isn‚Äôt running, which I found a bit odd.
- there are no rear air vents for passengers from the middle console between front seats and the compartmend under the front armrest isn‚Äôt cooled by the AC, it‚Äôs just a compartment. There are vents under the front seats directed towards the rear footwell.
- not exactly a critique but a 4x4 has different shifting ratios with the first gear meant to be useful offroad, but normally you start with second gear. The transmission does have a little too much rpm at 130 km/h in 6th gear (about ~2700 if I remember correctly). 
- it is still a little noisy at motorway speeds, mostly wind and road noise
- the trunk plate/floor that covers the spare wheel is a joke. I mean ‚Ä¶ words cannot describe this pathetic object in there. It‚Äôs a thin wooden plate, very shabbily clad with felt. From the top it isn‚Äôt aparent that much, but when you look in the spare tyre compartment and lift it you see the sorry state it is made. I can‚Äôt imagine why making a solid car in every way, but then putting that piece of crap in. I don‚Äôt think a respectable alternative would cost that much more.
- the piece under that floor plate is made out of molded white styrofoam. Which also doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence in longevity. I don‚Äôt know what a similar alternative could be, but that isn‚Äôt the finest feature either, and I don‚Äôt think the costs would have significantly changed if they used something else.
- not exactly a critique but body roll is present and it is worse than on a BMW x3 :)) but the ride is very comfortable. It‚Äôs just not a racer and it doesnt bother me because I don‚Äôt drive it in a way that that would be a problem. I know why I have a higher body clearance car, and why a sporty firmer suspension would not work well for me.
- the Media Nav system works fine and is a no fuss, well thought out simple but all-the-features-you-need system with very good legibility and logic, but can sometimes have a mind of its own, although very very rarely. Especially when updating it via usb key. They have now made it easyer for android phone users because the updating process is done via their phones with an app instead of the usb key. The latter method simetimes does not record the neccessary data on the usb key and when you try to download updates - you cant because it‚Äôs empty. The process of recording data pn the key in the car is slow and it‚Äôs a drag if it‚Äôs unsuccessful when you bring it home and see it‚Äôs empty and you cant download updates to it. And I have done everything right 100%. It‚Äôs just a quirk the system has. Phone updates work flawlessly I hear, but I have an iphone so for now no option for updates for me.",Dacia

What would get dirty and clogged sooner with a lot of low rpm driving is the EGR valve, a diesel owners favorite and one of the top reasons for having to take the car into a shop.

">The regeneration continues after engine is stopped

In order to do a successful regeneration, or to even start it, you need 2 things : a very high temperature (over 600 degrees) and a constant RPM. How can you keep both mandatory conditions with the engine stopped and the radiator fan going ? üòÇ

The fan keeps going after you turn off the engine to do the sole thing that it can - cool off something by circulating the coolant (turbine after a long drive on the highway, a particle filter after it finished the regeneration or it may indicate a problem with the cooling system).

>The mechanic at the dealer told me that the 10-15 minute fan going on after stopping the car is a sign it is finishing regen on DPF

What the mechanic said here is what I explained above - after the successful (or not) regeneration process, because of the high temperature, if you turn off immediately the engine, the fan keeps going in order to cool down the whole exhaust, were the particle filter is also situated.

The suggestion is therefore that electric cars might well be cheaper than ICE cars in the fairly near future. That would be very interesting.",Dacia

Duster 2 is pretty much just a bigger facelift of Duster 1, which makes it a sibling of first Logans and Sanderos. The quality is subpar by today's standards, despite all the polishing Dacia made to justify the price increases.

"Renault mechanic checking in here (Dacia are Renault). 

Common problem on them, 99% chance the rubber bungs under the scuttle panel are clogged with leaves. Field fix is to set wipers to park position, remove wipers, partially remove scuttle panel (plastic cover just at the bulkhead in engine bay), there should be a few torx screw and some plastic clips, at which point it should be apparent and holding water. If so feel around for the bungs (located in far corners, no you can't see them, but you can push them down and through which will immediately alleviate the water.

"Yes exactly this on my 2019 Duster 4x4. Not the doors (as others have suggested); it's from the air intake. I've cleared leaves, but I have a feeling it's just a poor design. When the car is left outside in heavy rain (there's been a lot of this lately), it can get into the cabin air inlet. The water comes in during the first minute or so of a journey. Always on the left (passenger side). It can be seen running down from the area below the glove box.

Also I get a noise like sand being shaken side to side at the same time, that I think is probably related. That seems to come from the air inlet area under the bonnet too. I live down a stony track though so I guess you might not hear that if you have a smooth start.

I'm still within the 6 month dealer guarantee (second hand), and it's only really shown up bad in the recent wet weather, so I'm considering taking it back for them to fix it, but the dealer is 100km away so I'd rather not have to. And if it is simply a design fault (air intake area not adequately shielded from rain) then there's not a lot they could do about it.

I first noticed this in the back seats well, but I've since realised it simply ran through from the front because of the angle the car was at.",Dacia

There only are the two trims available in the UK.

And it does list the window tint at 25% for the Expression so I don't think it's wrong for me to expect that.

Luckily I put some of the cost on a credit card, so that offers even more protection against this sort of thing - I'll just get them to take over dealing with it if I feel I'm getting messed around, which, with the deafening silence from Parks I'm beginning to worry about because lets face it, one salesman telling me anything he likes doesn't mean anything if it's not in writing.",Dacia

"Duster was never made with 4x4 in mind. From the very beginning 4x2 version was outselling 4x4. Duster was launched when SUVs started to become popular in Europe but due to high price inaccessible for more budget conscious customers. It perfectly filled 'affordable SUV' niche.

Yes, marketing was and is offroad centric, and Duster is widely recognized as great 4x4 car. But it represents small % of all cars sold. In countries were LPG is popular ECO-G engines are 80-90% of all Dacia sales (according to my local dealer). 

Dacia, in general, is trending toward positioning itself as 'outdoor' brand rather than generic 'affordable' brand. And that affects its price competitiveness. But they have no choice. None of the European brands will be able to compete on price with Chinese. 

It's still targetting the same group of customers in need of mid-sized affordable SUV. And those needing 4x4 have an option to purchase one as well.",Dacia

On a long journey I'll easily get better then 5.7L/100km, 50mpg, provided I don't hammer it (say, at 110kmh/70mph).

The only negative feedback I hear consistently is the location of rear door handles, For car with such a high ground clearance they are impossible to reach for smaller kids.

And the interior, even though it's same old cheap plastic, is so much better looking. It's great other models will also use it.

I only drove it as a replacement while my Duster was at service and I‚Äôm a tall guy and didn‚Äôt feel cramped in it (while I do in the old Sandero) so I think it‚Äôs a big enough interior and everything from how it drives to equipment is very very nice.

my feelings on the car are if you keep the revs down and don't hit the turbo its probably how you think it would be.

I've got a reply from the official importer.

They were in contact with my dealer.

They seem to be a bit offended, because they ""always took my car in under warranty"", as in what more do I want? I want my car to function. That is all.

I will ask the dealer to write a statement that the car is in perfect working order as they seem to believe. I will hand over that statement to the buyer when I sell the car and keep a copy for myself in case it comes to lawsuits later on.

On lpg engine has more torque and power and better price per 100 km as well. As fuel prices here are rising, lpg price drops a little bit, at the moment 100km in city, with bad traffic jams costs around 5.60 euro, highway smth around 3.60-3.70.",Dacia

"In Poland we call that turbodziura (Turbo-hole) - that moment of low power just before turbo kicks in. I just don't think that it's pronounced in 100hp Sandero, but my previous car was 150hp so maybe I am just used to much bigger turbo effect.",Dacia
"It's a big car, it'll be more then enough for your space needs. If you'd want the ground clearance maybe see if there's a Stepway variant available. It'll be a bit more expensive though.

The 'problem' that I'd see with this car is that you're paying about half of the original price for a car that's about halfway to its expected end. See, depreciation hits 'cheap' cars differently. In about 50k you can expect some more maintenance coming up that comes with mileage, which can range from mild, the ball joint bearing sleeve, to more expensive, the control arm.

For about 2k more you should be able to get a far younger example. But, if you are able to keep more money in the pocket to reserve for maintenance that's also very nice.

Have it checked by another garage (pre purchase inspection) would be an advice. They'll also check if it's been maintained according to the manual and be able to tell you what maintenance will be coming up. At 8 years its probably due for brake fluid, spark plugs, engine coolant. Or if that's all been done, that's great. But you could be able to tell by looking into the service manual and the maintenance records. 

Tl:dr, if a bit younger car is in the cards, that would be great, if not, have it checked before purchase so you know if there's problems and what kind of maintenance to expect.",Dacia

"Quick update:  
The seatbelt mechanism that was replaced a bit over a month ago died again. I think i need to go back to driving school, because obviously i'm doing something wrong. Either that or Dacia quality is #hit....

The car also began to randomly not start (maybe once in 5 to once in 8 startups), so i basically need to turn the key off and repeat the starting sequence and hold the key for longer, having the starter motor run for up to 10 seconds before the thing starts to chooch. Oh, and yes, the car now randomly shuts down when driving on cold engine, which is a nice bonus.

The service just shruggs off my complaints, saying we have to wait for firmware updates from the manufacturer or some other excuse.

My family had three new dacias and two new renaults up until now, but I will never buy another dacia/renault again. I cannot even sell this thing because i would either have to lie about car not having any issues which is morally not an option or sell it for half price because it obviously has some major problems that will eventually bring major costs to fix them.

I dont wanna say that service did a bad job, because, after reading the ODB errors, and during this time pressing the clutch, it said something like ""Pedal not pressed"" or something what did not represent the fact (clutch was pressed or not pressed and ODB displayed ""clutch pressed/nor not pressed"", cant remember, but it showed definitely the counter part), so logically the service thought it must be the clutch sensor. So, althought it might be due to broken brake switch, and although my brake light always lighting up when braking, the issue lays with that switch. But why my brake lights always did their job?

"It depends on your confidence, skills, and budget.
I'm not too sure about the stock sound dampening and insulation in the spare tire well, doors and back hatch. But having that dampened and insulated will help alot and should always be done before or together with swapping out speakers.

Good speakers can be had for 50-90 a piece and that's for good to very good quality. 
Pro quality goes further then this and will require more hardware. Having it done just the speakers is anywhere between 400 and 1000.

Sound dampering is about 50-250 per door depending on quality. You will need some simple tools as well as spare plugs for the interior trim.
Having this done can be anywhere from 1000 tot 3000 depending in quality and the area you want covered.

Generally a basic speaker upgrade and basic sound dampening will cost 800-1500 to get done professionally.",Dacia

"Go to a dealership and try to sit in each car and see how comfortable it is.I'm 1.84m and if I set the driving position to where it's comfortable for me (basically the seat all the way back), then there's absolutely no room for anyone in the backseat behind me. This is the case for the Jogger, Duster and Sandero stepway, with the addition that headspace for a sandero stepway is pretty small (I was actually banging my head against the ceiling a couple of times, and I'm shorter than you). I tried out the one with the sunroof, maybe it's better for the ones without.

So in terms of headspace, forget the Sandero stepway and go either for Duster or Jogger.

The practical difference between the Duster and Jogger is that the Duster sits higher up (by 2cm) and has a smaller booth (about 470L for the LPG version, \~1600L with the seats folded down). I think that's still pretty decent. Not sure about the boot space for the Jogger but it's definitely bigger.

In terms of weight, both vehicles weigh about the same.

With the 1.0L engine they might be a bit sluggish, but honestly that depends on your preferences. It's fast enough that you can overtake safely (given enough space), and you can get up to highway speeds relatively quickly. I test drove the Duster with the 115 HP diesel engine (they didn't have the LPG one for test drive) and it was honestly fine. Its easy to drive, fuel consumption is great, but don't expect it to be a race car. Also, you'll have to get used to the engine a bit, it likes to get revved up and puts down the most power at aroun 4-5k RPM. Just make sure that you break in the engine first before your start going to town on it (<3k RPM for the first \~1k kilometres).

I also test drove a Logan with the same engine (1.0 with LPG) and that was also fine, just bear in mind that the Logan is about 100k lighter.

If you want something that's a bit more powerful, then consider the Dusters with the more powerful engines or the hybrid jogger. These are going to cost a bit more and have a bit of a smaller boot space (Duster), not sure about the Jogger.

EDIT: My recommendation is that you go to a dealer and see for yourself. Set the driving position to where it's comfortable for you and then try to sit in the backseat behind the driver. See how it feels, how much space you have. Also bring someone a bit shorter with you to see if they would fit comfortably behind you. That way you know how many people you could realistically lug around.

&#x200B;

EDIT2: One thing I forgot to mention. With the seats folded down, you have about 170cm space in the Duster for long items. In the jogger it's about 180cm (but this also depends on how far back you put the front seats).",Dacia

"Replying from the land where that car was originally built... Romania... Dacia is basically the de facto cab car here. I've personally seen the 2017 model (not the MCV but the sedan) with the 0.9 engine with 900.000+ km on board. Usually we joke about anything below 200k saying that it hasn't even worn in properly at that stage. So if you maintain it well, I'm pretty sure it will outlive you.",Dacia
"My guess would be that the engine is burning oil, which can happen with any engine that‚Äôs old enough or hasn‚Äôt been maintained properly.
A couple of questions which might help in diagnosing the issue:
Does the oil level reduce even if the car is not used? -> it‚Äôs a leak then most likely
If the oil level gets reduced only while the car is used, then at what kilometre intervals does it happen and how much gets consumed? For example is it 100ml every 10k kilometres, 500ml every 1k kilometres, etc.?
What engine is in that car?
How frequently was the oil changed? Time and km intervals",Dacia

They‚Äôre not as economical as the excellent diesel but at least are proper engines.

And is that 1.6 naturally aspirated engine in the hybrid 140 version the ancient suboptimal engine from the older Dusters and Renaults? Now repurposed as an old already silly guy getting help from the electric motors?

"Pressing the gas pedal stronger deactivates eco mode, says the manual.
I have used it extensively. I don‚Äôt see the 0.5 l lesser consumption. It may be that I drive more aggressively with it the feature on.

I found at the end I get practically the same consumption - maybe 0.1 l better. If. The engine is the diesel 1.5 115 blue dci. When I had the feature mostly on for 5000 km the average consumption showed 4.9 l / 100 km. Now it shows 5.0 after 4000 km.

"Hi, 
Dacia Sandero Stepway 3(2022) owner here,after 10k km since i have it here is my opinion.
First,the car is the best for the money...like the cheapest in my country for a new car...paid 12k euro for the bifuel 100hp petrol and lpg version,only option i dont have is the keyless package...for fuel consumtion you can get anything between 6.5L-11L/100km depending on conditions
 (eg. For city in winter for small 2-3km trips from a to b and letting the car there for 3-5 hours you can get 11...for highway driving you can get 7...those are Lpg numbers...
for petrol 8-10 city 5-6 highway)

Now...the quality is not stellar...don't expect bmw comfort...but that being said is quite nice and well designed ,i think is better then the fiat you have but that's just my opinion, to be sure test drive one.
Suspension is soft coming from a bmw ,but on bumpy roads is great...power is decent,not that slow like some people will say
Problems that i seen on forums...ac had some problems on some cars not working being low on freon or something , lpg sensor was recalled and changed at the first service on mine...other then that maybe the turbo rod someone told somewhere here but not that common i think, in my country anyway...
If you have warranty i think you wont have that much trouble...

I think it depends on the trim,Dacia
"It depends on the weight of the caravan and the towing capacity. Apparently both can tow 1500kg although I've found messages that say in '22 there was a 1200kg advice for the 2wd. 
I'd say if the car is to be your daily driver also, and your caravan is within the weights, it's not really going to matter and the 2wd would be preferable for daily use.

Edit: the '22 2wd can do 1200kg for the petrol and LPG versions. But somethings going on here because the older 1.6 does 1200 while a 2018 1.2tce can do 1500. 

The 4wd petrol versions seem to all be able to tow up to 1500kg.
Max towing capacity seems to be the same for diesel and petrol.


If you're just buying the car for towing I'd say diesel 4x4. Maximum low rpm torque from the diesel, offroad capable and you could pull your caravan from muddy fields like a champ. 
A gasoline 4x4 would miss that juice diesel power.


But realistically you're not going to do all that.
So more realistic would be 2wd diesel, great torque, more fuel efficient when towing then the gasoline.
But only if your caravan weight is within allowances.

But this depends also on the country you're in. Some countries charge insane road tax for diesel making it almost cheaper to rent one just for your holiday then owning one. And there's potentially emissions zones that could cause an headache.


If you're really keeping daily use in mind, the 2wd gasoline would still be more then fine. 

Hope this helps!",Dacia

"The NA engine is 65 (1.0 SCe 65) and the turbocharged 1.0 comes with 90 hp or 100 hp for LPG versions. At highway speeds you'll appreciate the turbocharged versions a lot.

Not sure about your financial situation nor the market you're looking in; my advice would be the 1.0 TCe (90 or 100) and personally, I'd opt for Jogger rather than Logan.

All 3, Jogger, Sandero, and Logan are on the same low-spec B platform, so they'll be very similar in terms of comfort and handling.

Renault is putting the same stuff in Dacia as is in Renaults, Nissans, and lately in the Mitsubishis (rebadged Renaults).

If you're not sure how to inspect the car, ask in your area for a mechanic that will be willing to have a look with you. It is an unpleasant cost, but it will help you avoid a much larger one on the long run.

The 1.0l engine is good, has never felt underpowered even with 7 adults in, so unless you need the auto then you'll likely never recoup the extra cost of the hybrid engine.

"Dacia cars remind me off cheap company cars and courtesy cars etc or the back off the new one does look nice though but they are probably running old tech in them etc still , brands like Dacia  are common in the uk I can see the appeal as the extensive warranty on a cheap brand new car , or someone who doesn‚Äôt care about cars they are packed with everything you need ,  but they not a car persons car , as someone who enjoys driving i can‚Äôt see anyone saying they would rather have this over a German or Japanese suv ,
For suv style cars if they where my thing id go for a Kia or Hyundai some real nice spec models and they also have an extensive warranty I see them as brands that stopped making cars in the 2000z in the uk market anyway as in proton who made cars with old Mitsubishi parts though to give them credit they had one hot hatch at the era off the Saxo ,Corsa ,206 era

"Beware that Duster is not built for large people. If you are tall and/or fat, you will be packed in like a sardine in a can, which will make longer journeys a pain. And the seat mechanism will wear out very quickly, starting to creak and dangerously wiggle - replacement is about 600-700‚Ç¨, and it's the exact same mechanism, which will wear out again (to be fair, there was an improvement in 2021 (I think), but it's only slightly sturdier, definitely not a solved issue).

I cannot really recommend the 1.5DCi. The engine itself is not bad per se, older versions could reach 400-500k easily, but the emission devices are complete trash, failing constantly, especially in the AdBlue versions. Stay away from 1.2TCe at all cost. 1.6 SCe is weak and rather sad engine, prone to heavy oil consumption (unless fixed under warranty, otherwise nobody would want to dish out 3-4k‚Ç¨). 1.3TCe is much, much better choice than anything else.

"Well ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd expect lower range with all the additional electronics and weight gain, sice it has the same power and capacity battery and motor.

Edit: Spring is cheap but not miraculously so - the mentioned competitors in the article - the BYD dolphin has a 60kWh battery and claimed range of 430km, while Citro√´n √´-C3 had a 44kWh battery and 320km range. Bys is ~26k‚Ç¨ and Citro√´n is ~23,5k‚Ç¨. Spring starts at - what? ~19k‚Ç¨? 

That means it isn‚Äôt really cheaper than the other two, but it is just a lower spec (regarding capabilities) car. Which is fine if you just need a in-town or inter-town and get-to-work car in the viccinity of your dwelling and don‚Äôt need the better capacity batteries or stronger motors that the other two have. 

But with the classic, ICE engined Dacias that wasn‚Äôt the deal: with a Dacia you got a decent powered engine taken from the current stock or Renault and powered similarly than the competition (of course without the higher power options) but still being the cheaper alternative to other cars in its size class. Dacia trimmed the cars back to the roots. In higher but still vompetitive specs you got a very good comfort standard equipment with not nonsene gimmicky stuff, just functionals. As a car they were comparable to the competition but cheaper. Yes they lacked better materials (depends how you look at ‚Äúbetter‚Äù - I always preferred robust plastic to tender, fine trim because adults - women with handbags - and especially kids ruin them) and lacked some fancy electric and entertainment features, but as a car a Sandero was comparable drive to a Clio or a P 206 ‚Ä¶ it featured a bit higher ground clearance in even regular, non-stepway version, which was a good feature if you lived in the country or like picnics in nature. 

The electric version is just a lower power and capacity - and corelatively lower price - option of competitors, while the ICE Dacias were a better value for money cars, (with tricks gimmicks and fancywork).",Dacia

"Actually ""the market"" is a system made of moronic regulations, producers, and people.

There is nothing inherently within people that demand SUV's. It's EU regulation which made small cars way too expensive and SUV's profitable - by allowing bigger cars to emit more gases. It's a straight line too when actually reducing emissions is much harder than increasing weight. So car makers increase size / weight of all cars and the price point between a small car and a big car becomes so narrow that people go for the bigger car.

It is regulation that made small cars way heavier and more expensive requiring them to become more luxurious so that they can be sold at a higher price point. But by selling them at that higher price point the delta to a ""luxury"" / bigger car has become so narrow - you may as well go bigger.

It's all backwards.

It is oversimplified to say ""the market"" wants it. There simply isn't any alternative choice possible.

In order to reach this milestone, the engine should almost always be between 1750 and maximum 2000 RPM.

"Get as youngest as possible with 1.3TCe (best engine without any discussion) or 1.0TCe.

Stay away from 1.2TCe, it's not worth at any cost.

1.6SCe is either perfect engine which will run forever, or unreliable piece of shit. There's no way to tell which one you're buying, so it's better to stay away from it. Besides unguaranteed reliability, is sucks at every aspect anyway,

1.5DCi is not a bad engine, but it's much more expensive to maintain than other variants (except 1.2TCe), so it's not worth it.

As for NCAP, the best source of information is the NCAP https://www.euroncap.com/en/results/dacia/duster/29898

Noteworthy weakness of Duster is that it's not made to accommodate tall and/or fat people. The driver's seat may wiggle because of it (700‚Ç¨). Other common point of failure is the gear lever not returning to neutral on it's own (400‚Ç¨).  Also check under the hood. For some reason, rodents love Dusters. Check the turbocharging hose on the top of the engine (300-400‚Ç¨), if there aren't any bitemarks in the rubber (might need to squeeze it a bit).

"I just saw a video of a 7 year old Renault Zoe, it‚Äôs battery was still at 89%. That is really old batteries that has held up great. We will likely/hopefully have a lot of new tech which makes quicker charging possible without degrading the battery. Alternatively cheaper batteries which can be replaced. 

I have read your comments here and I see you really don‚Äôt like the direction we are heading in. I usually think politicians should keep their dirty fingers away from the market. And I do think ICE will have some room in the future too. But ICE is very mature, not much can be done for efficiency. BEV tech is still very young and we will likely soon make tremendous strides in battery tech, both for safety, quick charging, capacity, longevity and price. The benefit of politician‚Äôs pushing BEV is that it has made car manufacturers pour money into BEV research which means new teach will be available sooner rather than later. I think without doubt we will get to a point within a decade where ICE just can‚Äôt compete on price compared to BEV, without any subsidies. At that point no more pressure is needed on the market, likely they don‚Äôt even need to forbid ICE cars since most people will simply buy BEV. The caveat here is of course that I am predicting the future now, and I could then of course be wrong, so it‚Äôs just my optimistic opinion. 

I personally have a Polestar 2 right now, long range. We lease it at a very affordable price from work, otherwise it had made no sense. Now our work is removing this benefit and then electric makes no sense anymore. So I am getting a gasoline Sandero instead üòõ.

"I would wholeheartedly reccoment them. Very well built (at least those coming from Romania), tried tech (but on the flip side no new stuff). Comfortable, easy to maintain and durable interior (especially seats in the current models - older models had seats that deteriorated quickly). They could easily inherit the VW slogan ‚ÄúDas Auto‚Äù, The Car. Because it is exactly that plus some perks in electronics - but no latest stuff.

What I would criticise is - but goes more to previous gen of models - the lack of trying to design interior that is versatile, has clever practical solutions for various stuff from storage to comfort inside. They already have ingeneers that adapt and use the catalog of Renault/Nissan parts and tech, research materials (saw a promo Dacia video) - it wouldn‚Äôt be such a big extra cost to give a task to male interior more geared to practicallity to them. That would make an incredible advantage. That would make them low cost, a little out of step with the tech race, but functional and proven tech, with great usability solutions - where it matters: the everyday use. They already are the former but lack a bit in the latter
They did start to implement some stuff in the current models: for example the phone compartment/ledge that can modularly be converted into inductive charging phone ledge. Then there‚Äôs the boot based collapsable sleeping bed for the Jogger, and modularity regarding another two seats in Jogger. There could be more stuff that costs cents but gives big value to users: little differebtly molded door trims that have usable compartments for different stuff, or especially the front part between front seats and under the controls.

"For the money and reliability, I'd consider buying a Suzuki S-Cross or Vitara as well. Same kind of utility. Great reliability. But a bit more mature as the generation of Duster you're looking at isn't that much more evolved from the first generation. Meaning it's going to be a bit more basic (and louder on the inside) then the comparable Suzukis. Now I don't care about that too much for myself but driving with our baby was kind of shitty until we got a quieter car, apparently she hated the excess noise.

For your conditions and mileage you may be right to go petrol. On the other hand if LPG is avaible in your area a Duster with bi-fuel LPG may do your wallet a big favour.

If you're not going off road, 4x4 can be somewhat of an advantage in heavy snow. But have you ever missed that capability in your current Rio?
Good quality winter tires will be as much of a factor or more in how well your car does in winter.

Then finally, you could do very well with an bit older Volvo station and they're plenty over there. But it comes with more expensive maintenance. 
Safety will be top notch though.

In closing, you'll have to study what the NCAP really says and the types of crashes and the scores it gets.
Driver assists are a big factor indeed.
On the other hand my old car had a lower NCAP score because the rated score for damage to pedestrians and cyclists if they were hit was about 50% worse. My old car wouldn't crumple too well. My new car would probably save the grandpa on his e-bike that I just ran over but my car would be fucked for the damage.
Side collisions on the rear, safety, is where you'll want to look. Because your child will be behind the passenger seat for most of its time in the car as its the safest place and sometimes mandated by law even. My car has screen/curtain airbags there that work in perfect tandem with my kid car seat, bumping the safety up to a 95% safety score compared to the 40% death trap score that my old 3 door had.
So all in all, the devil is in the details.

Personally the collision avoidance is one system I genuinely value for being there. As a parent you'll often be fucking tired the first years. It'll give you some false alarms here and there, probably. I've had it go off 5 times in the last year, and 2 were very real situations where traffic stopped way more sudden then I'd seen or anticipated (with sweet daughter girl crying in the back so yes I wasn't 100% focused.)

You can check the maintenance intervals in the car's manual. I'm sure you'll find the correct answer there.,Dacia
"So is the orange light only a maintenance minder? On a lodgy this thing now comes intermittently, and very rarely. Had it come on while driving then it turned off after a few seconds. Got it after starting the car and disappearing while started driving.

If it's a maintenance minder, why is it intermittent?",Dacia
"I've boungt a 2x4 petrol Dacia Duster Black Shadow from 2017. It had driven 120k km. I am from Scandinavia too. My fiance and I drove about 35k km in it so far over 1-2 years and here are my thoughts from what you are writing: 

1) Size and mini-camper. 

The size is perfect. We made a DIY foldable and flat-packable bed in the car with storage space. We went on a 10 days trip to france last summer and lived in the car. I can show you plans if you interested in this. We made it exetremely easy and easy to storage too. When we get kids we are planning to add a rooftop tent, so 2x can sleep in the car, and 2x can sleep in the tent.   
Also the size is great for just about anything. Milage is good. Fully packed on a ski-trip to the alps we drove between 16-17.5 km/l. On ""eco"" mode. 

To be honest I now wish we bought the same model, but as a 4x4. I would love the added stability and the possibility to climb different terrain when we travel. 

2) It is noisy. 

We got used to it. We can still hear a podcast on the road and have a good conversation. Though I know that this can be fixed. It requires some time and DIY solutions, but it is possible to it less noisy with a specific soundproofing material all over the car. 

3) If the wind is blowing, the car feels more alive - and you should be more focused when driving 110 km /h and up. 

4) Snow-driving. Last month we were doing a skitrip to Norway. It was extremely snowy and we have the all seasons tires. When we got into heavy snow we put on snowchains and we could drive easily uphill in 15-20 cm snow. 

5) Realiable.. Yes and no. It is reliable, but we had a red multifunction switch go on twice the past 6 months. We had it to a mechanic, who had a hard time diagnose it. Apparently this car has slightly sensitive sensors - which he said sometimes can give false alarms. Which is quite annoying. 

6) Safety. 

When i did my research, the reason it has a low score on safetytest was that it does not have the modern safety features. Like it doesnt brake by itself etc. The actual bulid itself went well in the crash-test. 

The way i see it; if you drive safely you're good. Accidents happen, but so many of todays cars will are so extremely modern - which makes me feel safer. If you need a better driving experience, where you feel the car will help ""driving"" - this is not the car for you.",Dacia

"Jogger is quite big for its engine 1L engine,unless you go for the hybrid engine. Its basically a longer (and heavier) Sandero Stepway.

The Duster is quite good with the right engine or configuration but its quite expensive.

The Stepway is the middle route, fully decked out its no more then 18-19k,but with the bi fuel engine keep in mind that you dont have a spare wheel and you have really small space in the trunk. For me its not a problem but for a family it may be a bit more difficult.",Dacia

"None of the current reviews are going to be objective. Being critical in a pre-production review would be a very quick ban from future reveals, and no ""journalist"" is going to risk that. They are all just rephraring the official introduction made directly by Dacia(even the car is the same, and on the same spot).

As for price, they want to keep the entry level trim below 20k, so I expect something like 19,990‚Ç¨. Given the current price differences between trims and engines, I assume the most common versions of new Duster will be at least 25-30k‚Ç¨.

NCAP... 3 stars would be success, but I have a feeling it's going to be 2 or 1. You cannot really reach higher without the non-mandatory driving assistants, and the crashes itself are going to be average at best.",Dacia

"Hard agree. While on vacation I had a current gen rental Renault Clio (so basically the same car as current Sandero) with SCe 65 engine and boy was it a struggle with four adults and luggage.

"Maybe a carmaker that isn‚Äôt responsible for hazardous material recycling vs one that is (like it‚Äôs the case with tyres and batteries) can cost less, but when those external costs pile up the price goes up. China‚Äôs environment standards are low. When they sell the cars here they include the cost for what they‚Äôll have to comply with into the cost of their product. 
Hazardous material decomposition/removal/recycling is one of the sensible regulations as it has great impact on the environment, whereas electric in relation to ICE is a smaller and less important CO2 saving move on part of the regulators that want to ban ICE. Modern ICE practically only save the immediate local environment, regarding the total co2 emissions  it isn‚Äôt as bad in relation to electric, when everything is taken into account (unless we make a lot more nuclear power plants).

Regarding the Spring - yes, my pount exactly! It is technically inferios car. While the samdero isn‚Äôt really. Sandero is just simpler but it us practically the same in functional terms as a car as its more expensive sibling Clio, same range and power - same engine, most pf the chassis features are the same‚Ä¶ etc. 

It was exactly my point that in the past Dacia offered in essence ‚Äúthe same‚Äù but for less cost (on account of some arguably unimportant stuff being omitted).

Now with their EV they just offer less for less money. 

Everything you said about it was needed for functional and long lasting use (capacity, power, battery cooling for longevity), and for a hefty price for what this car functionaly is. It is less car for less money. Which dudn‚Äôt use to be so. That was what I was talking about.",Dacia

"Depends what country you're in. Orders start in March in continental Europe, and later in the UK and Ireland, I think, but from order to delivery, that's going to be a long wait. The biggest change for the new Duster is the platform; something definitely worth waiting for. Duster 2 uses a platform from the late 90's. Duster 3's platform is modern. Although Duster 3 hasn't been crash tested yet, it will probably have better results than the Duster 2, but the overall stars will still be low due to not enough active safety electronics. The advantage of the Duster 2 is that it is tried, tested and refined as best as it can be. Any new model of car, when it comes out, might have some teething problems, but they should all be resolved under warranty. If I were you, I'd wait, maybe try to lease a car for a short period of time if you really need it, and then go for the Duster 3. Also, and that's subjective, the Duster 3 looks much better.",Dacia

Well I can‚Äôt really argue in any meaningful way than that the BEV tech can‚Äôt yet compete with ICE on price, which is what it‚Äôs all about. It will get there one day without government rushing it. BEV cars don‚Äôt really need lots of maintenance, what they need is swappable batteries and the batteries to make sense to replace coastwise. 

Today used BEVs like Zoe can be had for relatively affordable price. But I agree you can‚Äôt find them as cheap as an old ICE, however the cost of owning a car is much higher than the price of the car itself, especially with fuel. EU ducked up and electricity is now much more expensive than it needs to be, but if you charge at the right hours it‚Äôs still much cheaper than an ICE car, it‚Äôs also cheaper the more you drive. But people who drive less can generally also get a cheaper electric car with shorter range. If the Spring had 5 seats and it was 2 years old (like the Sandero I am now buying) it would make perfect economical sense for me to buy that one instead due to lower ‚Äúfuel‚Äù cost and service costs, even though the purchasing price would likely be higher than the Sandero I now am getting.

The seats are just a little soft for my taste. My 2008 Fiat Bravo (a great car with excellent 1.4 turbo engine!) had very similar feeling seats, and that car really needed harder ones with more support because the car behave very sporty.",Dacia
"Yeah i usually do go 150-160 on the autobahn as well. However there are moments on long straight stretches where i like to step on it, only for it to hit 183 then cut power and keept at 180 is annoying lol. It makes around 4000 RPM at that speed. I have gone to germany just to test it lol",Dacia
"Interesting. On [Polish website](https://www.dacia.pl/hybrydy-i-elektryczne/duster-suv.html) there is a little pop-up stating hybrid is only with 4x2, while 4x4 is only with TCe 130.",Dacia
"Pretty sure the touch screen version has it, idk though because mine wasn‚Äôt working properly and I replaced it with the one you have now",Dacia
3 pistons engine.,Dacia
"I'm in UK, ordered May 2022, advised delivery September 2022, it was finally ready for collection April 2023, the thing that annoyed me was that Dacia not the dealer said it was on it's way, when I finally got it I found several manufacturing labels, dated mid September 2022, so clearly not even built, I  wouldn't have minded if I  had been told ""fact"" not fiction, I  hope someone from Dacia reads this, but all that said I'm very pleased with it, oh a Duster.",Dacia
"Sveiks :)

Well, duster is heavier than sandero, also air resistance on highways are higher, thus mean that fuel consumption is higher too....now, in summer time I get about 8-8.2 l/100 lpg in city, about 6-6.5 highways. Lpg now costs 0.715, I have constant discount 4.5 cents per liter. So, there is my numbers :)",Dacia
"No they‚Äôre not‚Ä¶ 

They hold in the rear light cluster.",Dacia
Yeah went through all seals and couldn't find any sign of a leak through there,Dacia
Not sure what you mean.,Dacia
The 0.9 tce?,Dacia
Works on all Dacia models. Before i got the Duster i had this steering wheel on my 2006 Logan PH1,Dacia
will have to use it for that until i find a more logical solution,Dacia
"I have the Extreme SE - which I think was the same spec as the Extreme anyway? Having done 1 winter with the heated seats I love them, next car will have heated everything for sure. 

Personally I really like the alloys, sat nav is as useless as other sat navs - if you don't have android auto/carplay it'll do but if you've got it you don't really need the sat nav.",Dacia
Could be for the handles in a lawnmower...,Dacia
"Nice. My long term average is 38 mpg, but on shorter trips that do not involve highways I‚Äôm able to get to 48. As you mentioned its all about following gear indicator and eco. My wife hates that style of driving and typically enda up with 5 mpg less.",Dacia
"Just make sure to be buying premium petrol. Regular contains more biocomponents, and gets bad much quicker.

Also don't drive with empty petrol tank, you will kill the fuel pump.",Dacia
"The new Dacias are pretty stylish, reliable and cost efficient cars if LPG is an option in your area. I would recommend them.",Dacia
"Yup I know about it, this type has the belt tensioner and it.s easy, anywhoo thanks.",Dacia
I have one too in the exact same color. Only thing i am pissed about is the built in limiter at 180 km/h. I love going to germany to open the throttle wide,Dacia
Dacia: 2 spare rear axles,Dacia
"Very common problem.

Easy fix - replace the lever.

Permanent fix - some parts need to be changed and you need to put some relays.",Dacia
Why do chinese cars here cost more than the spring? Like the mwntioned BYD. We have to compare the comparable; ICE cars cost even less there too.,Dacia
"42mpg here, but that's because my wife still hasn't gotten used to cruising in a 30mph zone in 5th; she's usually still in 3rd or sometimes 4th. That was fine in our old 1.5l diesel but horribly inefficient in our 1.0l petrol Jogger.

But yeah, you really can squeeze the MPG out of this thing if you game your drives and keep to around 1200-1300 rpm as much as possible.",Dacia
"Yep, I do like the car, but this has all left a bad taste I have to say.

I've seen a few 25% tints on the back of other cars and there's no way mine has any - all the windows, front and back, are just the same clear glass.

I'm giving the dealer the chance to find out what's going on, but seeing as I've already fired off a few emails as I've discovered the various bits and bobs and had NOTHING back in writing or email then I worry I'm in danger of being fobbed off.

I think if I haven't heard anything back tomorrow I'll get in touch with Dacia.",Dacia
"I've the Extreme,  was told when it was ordered that feature wasn't available. But it doesn't take much to push them in.",Dacia
"Do you use winter tires? They generally increase fuel consumption by 1-3l/100km. Also, check tire pressures.

Follow the usual advice for fuel economy driving: coast more, predict when you need to stop and slow down before you apply breaks, etc.

Generally, this is a very small engine and running it at low rpms will add wear to the engine, e.g. if you're going uphill. Maximum torque on this engine is at 2000-3500 rpm. Don't lug it too much, use the appropriate rpm.",Dacia
"I am also interested in this, I already got my sandero and that 1 port is so annoying when both my wife and myself need to charge or to connect to CarPlay / Android Auto",Dacia
"Regarding real life battery degradation data (i.e. Measured degradation, not trusting the onboard computer assesment of the battery state) I recently saw a chart with data collected by an EV enthusiast (has his own youtube channel but I can‚Äôt for the life of me find the data I mentioned here in my hustory). That chart was quite concerning. If I remember correctly Tesla topped the chart and another brand showed practically no degradation, which the author soeculated must be due to some overprovisioning in the battery pack and smart management of that spare battery set tgat is not part of the usable capacity but rather gives the appearance (and effect) of less degradation of the whole pack. If I find it I will post it.

I also remember seeing tesla vs nisaan battery degeadation data where nissan‚Äôs pack deteriorated to 80% capacity and tela‚Äôs only 10 in a set period of time and similar use (charging, mileage) regimen. 

It also needs to be noted that efficiency of battery pack degrades with capacity degradation. You have a car that uses more energy (10-ish percent more) when you get to 70% capacity (if I remember the data correctly). That means range *further* drops on top of smaller capacity to hold energy. 

Another factor is that battery degradation isn‚Äôt linear. After beggining its use the capacity drops sharply, but then holds a fairly linear and predictable degradation drop downwards, until it starts to degrade sharply.

What all this means for the car market we can only guess. ICE cars engines can lice for decades with good maintenance. There are occasional costs involved but generaly and with a good mechanic they are bearable. Buying an old, used vehicle with what you can see and test drive and with little knowledge (or help of a mechanic you can take your car to examine it before buying) be sure hiw much it will cist you to repair this or that, negotiate price or if it‚Äôs a clean engine and mechanics - you‚Äôre good for a long time. Yes, there is a certain amount of cost involved with a used car, but it can be a cheap entry into private personal mobility world. 

Not so much so with the BEVs. Value retention will have to be *significantly* lower for buyers of new BEVs, and cars will be pretty much disposable. How will that reflect in the way they‚Äôll make other parts of the cars when they know they‚Äôre disposable?

Consider electric grid too. To accomodate violently volatile high-power draws from the electric grid it will need massive investment - paid by society that will also have to in parallel invest into more sensible climate change coping and adapting technologies. A Tesla fast charger draws insane amount of power, a small manufact√∫re amount. And it does it unoredictably. This is a problem for stability of the grid as well as power distribution and production. 

Battery, unless some not-before-seen chemical tech emerges, isn‚Äôt the way to go, in my view. Hydrogen has its own problems and I don‚Äôt know much about it but EVs with electricity generation  devices like fuel cells at the momemt seem a better choice to focus on.

Again - I am not against BEVs. I think they are one of the alternatives and something that is wellcome to co-exist in the mobility mix. BEV - if I has chance to charge at home - would be an excellent alternative to our current Sandero, if the price was at least like Sandero‚Äôs. But BEVs shouldn‚Äôt be encouraged to be adopted on the financial burden of aociety that subvents those purchases, and much less BEVs should be the only thing allowed to be sold. I simply don‚Äôt find it sensible from a societal standpoint. And I didn‚Äôt even mention the price here, which is another factor that jas impact on society and has the power to change lives very tangibly for the worse for some segment of society.",Dacia
"The gearbox does whine a bit, especially in 2nd.",Dacia
Probably leftover from factory.,Dacia
"Nope, nothing on the seat and this was different than the seat belt alarm. Never heard anything like it. So unbelievably loud. Maybe I shouldn't have described it as a beep. It's like an alarm. Like a screeching fire alarm beep.",Dacia
"As I said, the turbo kicks in quickly and the accelerator is quite sensitive, hence ""jumpy"", I am not really sure how to describe it better, sorry.",Dacia
"Its turns the aircon on and off. If your not noticing a difference between in and off it might need regasing or checking its actually all working. 

Aircon on everything set to cold is the tell tail sign. Even in the height of summer it should feel like ice, like starts to hurt its that cold.",Dacia
"Labor plus the clutch too.  

If the trans is out and Im keeping it I'm not leaving in a clutch with 200k kilometers.",Dacia
2020 models were/are 30l.  Later models (not sure the year) were expanded to 50l.,Dacia
Upgrade the speakers maybe,Dacia
"Jogger or wait for new Duster that will be announced end of Nov. 

Current Gen II Duster is based on a very old platform (2002) and is essentially an improved version of Gen I rather than a new car. A lot of underpinning or decors (e.g. door handles) haven't changed since inception. Jogger, Sandero are based on a relatively new CMF-B platform also shared by other cars in Stellantis group.

Personally, I enjoy Jogger cockpit layout more, but objectively Duster has more features available (360 camera; USB sockets in the back). Second row of seats seems higher in Jogger which is good for kids but not necessarily for you. Jogger boot is not to be underestimated. It's big and has very practical dimensions. 

Seating, driving experience is similar for the engine options you consider.",Dacia
"Where I'm from, the wait time for my Sandero Stepway was almost exactly 6 months.",Dacia
Enjoy your Dacia! Take a chill pill maybe you will find your days less shitty.,Dacia
"Yeah I meant new Duster, changed it (can't change title), thanks!",Dacia
Seems like a snowflake response,Dacia
"1.2 TCe is a bad engine !

Renault was even sued for this, lost and had to retire it.

Check the internet about it - it will run on oil at some point and there is no fix for it !",Dacia
Blind spot detection in rain/snow is a common challenge in all cars. Just assume it won't work correctly in those circumstances.,Dacia
