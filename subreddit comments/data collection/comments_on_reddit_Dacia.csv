"Thank you.

I did mean the 1.3, was also looking at Skoda Yeti which has the 1.4 and got them mixed up.",Dacia
"I’m 99% for a Jogger, it’s just the finances need to be ready 😄",Dacia
"To my eye, 24' is a much better look, I don't see Audi vibes, maybe a bit of some Škoda on the rear. Agree with you that a more powerful/bigger engine would have been nice and automatic gearbox for sure. The market for manuals is going smaller by the day.",Dacia
"There are 3 Automatic Transmissions available on Dacia cars currently. 

**Nissan/Renault XTronic CVT (Sandero/Logan):** Smooth, but longevity is questionable given the poor track record of Nissan/JATCO CVTs. 160,000km should be achievable nonetheless. CVT fluid changes must be done according to spec (at the latest) and using the correct Renault/Nissan CVT fluid. CVTs are very smooth, but some people don’t like the way they drone at medium RPMs. Ideal for city traffic. 

**Renault (Getrag) 6 Speed Dry Clutch DCT (Duster EDC):** Quite reliable, being a dry clutch unit it needs a bit more care in terms of driving style, and it’s not best suited to heavy traffic (start/stop). It’s said to be less smooth than wet clutch EDC transmissions used on higher end Renault models, but not too bad. 

**Renault Multimodal Hybrid Transmission (Jogger/Duster 2024- Hybrid):** The transmission had some early problems in the Clio Hybrid, but these were fixed under warranty. Medium term reliability seems to be good, it’s only been on the market since late 2020 in the Renault Clio. It’s a very complicated system from an electronics standpoint, so long term reliability has to be seen. It’s a very smooth system, but it has a habit of keeping gears very long when accelerating.

Previous:

**Renault Easy-R Automated Manual Transmission (Sandero/Logan/Duster):** To be avoided like the plague, it’s not so much unreliable, but horribly jerky like most automated manual transmissions (Hyundai AMT, VW ASG, Suzuki AGS). It also has a regular clutch like a manual car that will need to be replaced eventually.",Dacia
I have a 2023 model and must say 2024 looks great. Sadly it will also cost more so I'm just happy I bought duster when I could afford one new,Dacia
"Go down your local halfords and use their free baby seat fitting service, to test out some car seats, there are lots of designs/ISOfix bases etc, some will be larger, some smaller.",Dacia

"Power storage is not everything, I am sure the market could relatively quickly adapt to replaceable battery modules of different sizes. Yes you lose some space/capacity, however BYD already produces the extremely popular blade battery which technically has less capacity but safety and other reasons weight up this downside. Generally though I think it’s more likely we get batteries which are cheaper. degrade slower and last for more cycles while also being able to charge them quick. If you have a cheaper BEV for 10 years that would be a good deal, many manufacturers have warranty for 8 years or more (Renault has 8 years). The battery tech in 10 years is going to be so much better/cheaper that it makes sense to get a new car at that point. 

I think it’s good to try and be realistic and to be skeptical, but also we need to consider emerging technology and think a bit outside the box and have a bit of an open mind. Once they said we humans will never fly, then the weight brothers did just that. Then they said we will never fly over the english channel, then we did just that, then they said we will never fly across the atlantic, then we did just that. Then they said we will never fly into space, and we did just that. So they said we will never go to the moon, yet we did just that; and all in a very short timeframe. Not many years ago they said we would never have self driving cars, now we have that. They also said we might never have AI, now we have that to some degree. The best minds on the AI subject thought todays AI was decades away. These experts now think we will have a singularity sometimes during the 30’s. Maybe they are wrong once again and it’s just a few years away. Tech can quickly come which changes everything.",Dacia

"Not a fan of side steps in Duster. They aren’t really needed to get in while they can make pant legs dirty when getting out and reduce overall clearance. 
Surprised to see wind deflectors as well. Do you have a version without air-con? 

Otherwise, it’s a 4x4 Duster - looks best when it’s battered, scratched and dirty :-).",Dacia
"Nice.

In our Sandero we are getting about 42 around town (lots of shorter trips and stop start). On a motorway run with the CC on we managed to hit 70.1 (average) for a while and that overall trip of 600 miles with motorway, town, country and traffic jams ended with a trip computer average of 69mpg and an at the pump average of 66mpg.",Dacia
"Looking forward to tomorrow announcement. Several photos leaked over the past months, not surprised about exterior design. More interested in how interior changed.

"Honestly, I'm so sick of dealing with that dealership. They have been causing me nothing but trouble since I bought the car. They've already botched multiple jobs from the outset. It was back and forth for months. I'm tired of dealing with them and I don't trust them. It's Martins of Winchester. I would not recommend buying a car from them. They're very dishonest and have very low standards of work.",Dacia

"You may need to enter into CarPlay mode. When i plug in my phone on a Dacia Lodgy there’s a prompt at the bottom right of the screen that I need to click entering CarPlay mode. From there I can play music trough Spotify. No need for an App tough. Otherwise if you’re phone is paired to your car via Bluetooth, selecting audio source to Bluetooth might also work. Hope that helps also on a Jogger MediaNav",Dacia

"I'm using Eco while I break-in the engine, so I don't have much experience with that yet. The car doesn't feel very agile while pulling away anyway, it's certainly not good for quicker acceleration. But I'm not an aggressive driver so it's not too much an issue for me.",Dacia

"No previous experience, but if there is a youtube video I can definitely do it myself 😛

Would probably not care about dampening, just want something good enough, better than what we have now, don’t want to spend too much money on it, after all that’s why we got the Dacia in the first place, lol. Currently it’s the 4+2 speaker system in the car, the “high end” lol, sounded like shit, though our previous car had a really nice Harman Kardon system (god i will miss that).",Dacia

"Engines, packages are different between countries. It's worth mentioning where are you purchasing your car.

The UK config is a little weird. You definietely get the height adjustable seat on Extreme, it wouldn't make sense to not have it. You can buy mat or alloys on amazon. And you will be likely be using applecar/android auto for navigation anyway. So from the differences you listed it's only the heated seats that really matter. There are however differences that are not clearly mentioned:

1. You can only have cedar green on Extreme, but you are also forced into bronze mirror and accents that look crap on any other color than cedar green.
2. Extreme has microcloud upholstery (compare interiors between the two versions) which is a cool feature for families with small kids. Microcloud is fairly easy to clean.
3. Extreme also has extended grip which helps to get out from muddy terrain. 
4. Extreme has shark fin, which can be purchased as an accessory to Expression. 

Overall, for me it the choice would be down to color and upholstery. 

It's a great car nonetheless. I have it for more than a year and love it.",Dacia
Please upload some pictures when you get it! Great choice!,Dacia
"Best? Depends what you want from it.
The 1.5 dCi 115 is also great and the 4x4 is available with that engine. It is powerful enough even with 115 hp with the little better torque than 150HP petrol.",Dacia

"Yes, it could be.",Dacia
"If push came to shove it will be easy enough to check (in a legal sense) what the webpage said on the day I ordered my car, I really don't think that's going to be an issue where they are going to be able to say they've just added that to the spec after I put my order in when I am 100% sure it was already advertised before I went to the dealer.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure where you are, but the laws are pretty stringent in the UK when it comes to advertising.",Dacia
First thing I thought too!,Dacia
"Well, that’s why i’m asking. Honestly first of this is the first car I own, secondhand, it did not come with a manual. I live in Sweden, 0 homes has AC afaik, at least not apartments, a afaik most houses in the city has heating from the city, not AC. I just don’t know these things. Heat/cold comes out of the car no matter if the button is pushed or not. So i am asking, maybe it’s broken, so that’s why i’m asking, because I am unsure about what is normal, so that is why i’m asking stupid questions, and it pisses me off everyone is so rude about it, saying i am lazy or stupid. This is why people shut up instead of asking things they wonder about, lucky for you that you never ever had to ask any stupid/lazy question in your whole life.",Dacia
"Running a Jogger here and points 5 and 6 happened to me as well.

5. This is a known issue with all these Renault engines. It happens on Clios as well, for example. It's only cosmetic noise but to totally fix it, they need to replace the turbo. The noise comes from a metallic fitter or something like that. My dealership had a semi-fix that reduced the noise to half of what it was. A complete fix would have to come from Renault's engineering before they can deploy it.

6. My dashboard lights once became like a Christmas tree, a lot of light and injection system warnings. That was fixed with an ECU software update. It seems there is a bug within the ""injection calculator"", as the dealership told me, and since that software update half a year ago, the problem never came back.

My Jogger currently has 35000 km.",Dacia
Mic is a plastic thing above driver’s head. This one is temp sensor.,Dacia
"I couldn’t care less of the Brand and “look” as long as it is an affordable and capable 4x4.

I happily would just have the bare minimum in it - like a shell - similar to the Landcruiser 70s series.

The point for me is 4x4

And there’s practically speaking nothing available in Europe. Someone meantioned the Jimny but it’s sold out and they only made a few to cater for the really dumb EU regulation which favours big useless luxury SUV’s that have none of the capabilities they were originally designed for. A SUV is a car that is supposed to have clearance and 4WD. Increasing they are just “higher” cars with little clearance and no 4x4 capabilities.

The new Duster design simply tells me that this will ultimately be the fate of the Duster aswell.

Hence my comment.

PS some may argue the new Defender is a very capable (expensive) 4x4. And it is. As long as you don’t run into trouble in the middle of nowhere. The over-reliance on electronics means that you cannot tow the car for more than 10 mins (unless you use a flatbed) . If you conventionally tow it for more than 10 mins (on Neutral) the car will automatically switch to P causing the gearbox to break requiring a total replacement. It actually says so in the manual. Getting a flatbed tow truck into a 4WD area is impossible. Getting that car out would be a ridiculous exercise of towing for 5 mins (just to be sure you don’t totally break the car!) then waiting and changing gears then towing it for 5 mins again. Just imagine doing that on difficult terrain!! 

And battery systems can totally shut down to the point where you can’t restart the engine using conventional means.

That alone disqualifies it as a useful car.

On top of it, at that price point, I’d be scared to scratch it! 90000€!!!",Dacia
"Yeah, I hope the tip from the guy above works, it's the same with me,  the radio works for like a minute or two and then I get a message that it will turn off to protect the battery.  I really hate this, in my previous cars I used to sit like that for hours and listen to radio without any issues.  First time I got a car without a key and this has been a struggle, today I just wanted to charge my phone without turning on the engine and it pissed me off",Dacia
"Automatic folding mirrors are an optional extra you pay for, you didn't pay for it so its not there.

Manuals cover everything that car can have normally so they can print 1 version and stick it in every model of that car",Dacia
"> they're not your typical auto gearbox and are more complicated and hence have a higher tendency to break.

Other way around. CVT is the most simple and cheapest variant of automatic transmission, that's why they are used in cheap cars.

It was beautifully shown in the Audi A6 C7 - the basic entry-lever versions had CVT, the middle versions had DCT and only the top-of-the-line versions got torque converter.

DCT's are faster and CVT's provide better mpg. But the main reason why manufacturers abandoned torque conververs is their complexity and price, even though they are the most reliable and comfortable.",Dacia
No because they're crap and I wouldn't touch a Duster with a barge pole!!!,Dacia
"Yes, my Sandero stepway has only 2 years but so far no problems whatsoever",Dacia
I’m sorry,Dacia
Nope,Dacia
Why.... it's a dacia!,Dacia
"I think I may have fixed it. I removed the light fitting and pushed some little squares of sound insulation foam into the space above the liner. I also carefully pulled a bit of the liner away around the door frame and did the same thing. I can't hear that rattle anymore, based on my test drive... But now I have a new rattle from the driver's seat somewhere. 🙃",Dacia
"Father of two kids here, yes. Upgraded from golf when youngest was born. Duster easily has enough space for a stroller and a lot more if you like tetris. If you remove trunk top cover you can fill it even more. I plan to get topbox to have place for event more stuff when we go camping and stuff.  
I did consider jogger for a while so that trunk space if not even an issue, but duster made more sense on bad roads in my country",Dacia
Thank You,Dacia

You need a replacement radio surround [like this one I found on eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/285173465833?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=c3efdtxsskc&sssrc=4429486&ssuid=DytwUOOaT0i&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY) which incorporates a 2 DIN cutout then you can go to a car audio retailer and buy a CarPlay unit,Dacia
"Re p.1 faulty LPG level indicator was a common problem last year here in Poland. Local dealership was replacing it with a new one. 

Re p.2 my 2022 1.0 TCe 110Km (petrol only) Jogger is experiencing similar issues but on a more subtle scale. It happens for up to 30 secs after engine starts but it's barely noticeable.  Could be something related to fuel injection, maybe?",Dacia

"It should. We live in France and we got ours with the bars (2021 Duster) during a sale. You should be able to find it on the Dacia website - look for accessories or the webstore for accessories. 

I think we got the 480L. It’s good, the latching mechanism to open the box is a bit wonky if you try to open it without having it on the bars - but you get used to it. It’s a bolt/screw mechanism at the end of a cable to attach it to the roof. I was a bit uneasy with the system but it’s been solid through a 2000km trip we did in July.",Dacia

The reason I'm pointing you towards this is there's ton of information and videos online on 'how to drive a manual' but depending on the sort of learner you are those cars are not YOUR car and having someone observe you and give real feedback on your motions can be infinitely more helpful.

"Thank you! To be honest, i've never been in a bmw, so my standards are very low 🤣
Jokes beside, for my budget and my country, I could buy the Sandero or the Fiat Panda. Honestly, I like Sandero way more, but maybe if I add some money I could buy a Clio, or a Corsa, something better. I don't know if it's worth it or would be more smart simply buying the Dacia and keep my money. It's ok for me if the manufacturer has saved on non-essential aspects of the car. I don't have expectations on interior materials quality, cloth ecc. for me it's important that everything essential (engine, lights, AC, battery, gear, windows, ecc) works and lasts well.",Dacia
"My brother is 6’3 and he has two kids seats in the back of his Dacia Sandero. The younger child had the seat reversed until recently. He’s never had an issue with getting in comfortably in either his driving position or the passenger seat when his wife is driving.

At least the petrol models. Hybrid is already more expensive as far as I remember. But in relation to other hybrids in its class it’s still ok - but overall price is too high. 

Electric vehucles *are* a problem because they can’t be made cheap. They also aren’t a car to use for 15 years. Especially those with small batteries that may see more charging if used a lot.

But I agree with other regulations that are becoming unsensible, like some regulating institution wants to show they are still relevant and because all the bases have been covered invent the need to have less relevant systems obligatory. This jacks up prices and makes vehicles less attainable.

"I don‘t think EVs are the problem here. The reason that the Dacia Spring and Duster are going upmarket and becoming more expensive is that more and more electronic assistance systems are becoming mandatory. To offset the inevitable costs of adding these systems, Dacia must offer some gimmicks to sweeten the deal. Plus Euro 7 has been diluted, so in effect emissions regulations won’t add as much cost as initially expected. 2035 is still 11 years away so in most countries bans are not on the horizon in a way to negatively impact cost yet.",Dacia

"Short answer is good
Long answer...LPG consumtion 350km-450km (city-highway)so 7-8 highway,in city bumper to bumper at 15 km/h average speed 11L...this is the worst i can get it with short trips(2-3km)...but is cheaper ...from this you can get as much as 2L lower on petrol...yes highway 5L/100km is doable
Feeling is good ...is not a sport car but is nice ,no problems for now after 13k km ...is a car that on the economy side is excelent...on the driveing side you can decide on a test drive ,the interior quality is ok,funcional ,the trunk is kinda small if you want to go on vacation with 4 people and want to take the house with you...but you can get the roofbox ,the bars are super nice and easy to change ....

90deg connector really works well, a normal USB sticks out of the dash too far and I am sure I would bump it when pressing the touch screen.  


USB cable is 1M long, I found that was just enough neatly tuck along the dash with some slack for attaching the phone. 1.5M is probably better if you want to be able to take out the phone and use it while attached but since I am driving I don't need that option, I connect the phone when I get in the car and don't touch it again until I get out of the car.

"This isn't a tip specific to Dusters but petrol in general, you will need to give it some gas to get it going at times.

Find somewhere quiet to practice brining the revs up to like 1.5k and holding it there, then you can just release the clutch like you normally would. Even with the handbrake you are literally doing all these steps but just disengaging your handbrake at the biting point, you can even let the car pull forward a little bit before disengaging (useful for when on steep hills and you want to make sure you aren't going to roll back). Listen to the engine though, if it's screaming, you are giving it way too much, at most you will only ever need 1.5-2k revs to pull away on even a steep hill. 

If it's stalling, you need to be giving it a bit more but learn to recognise when the engine is about to stall, then you can give it a bit more or dip the clutch and stop the stall.

When you first pass, there is still absolutely loads to learn and part of this is now having the freedom to go out and do it in your own time. Enjoy your new car!",Dacia

Opel Mokka has almost the same score as Sandero in the two first categories, but it has 4 stars because it also is good at protecting pedestrians and has more active safety assist features. https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/features/opinion/tom-wiltshire/dacia-jogger-euro-ncap/

"As I said in my edit, there probably are more reasonable choices for us on objective paramiters. I just want to explore the possibility of the Duster, because I think I'd like it more than most other cars.

Eyeballing it it seems like the Duster 2nd gen is about equal in front and second row space as for instance a Hyundai i30 or KIA Cee'd (but since they're estates they probably have a bigger boot). 

In our used car market, it seems that in order to get that extra bit of space in the back row while retaining boot space, a Volvo V60, Volkswagen Passat or Skoda Octavia is the next step up, but it comes with more miles for the same money.

2) the (lack of) dampening is 50% of the sound performance. Even if you put only a little of the cheapest stuff in, it's going to make a difference in a car that doesn't have some dampening already. Because right now your speakers don't have a good back board, the sound bounces into a shitty thin metal sound box on the back side distorting and worsening its performance.

Just putting better speakers in sure, but you're not getting what you paid for unless you put some dampening in. If you only do the doors it's not going to cost you that much.",Dacia

These engines need higher revs to show they’re alive. They’re not ideal for a novice driver and one without any natural feeling for driving mechanics of the car.

One issue on pricing is that these weren’t sold in very large numbers in my country so the used market isn’t that big to allow for comparisons. A used VW Golf estate for instance is at least 50 percent more expensive with the same metrics. That would still be an alternative but we’d miss out on the principle of not having to finance over our trade in car.

I’ve discovered as well that the car I’m looking at only had one owner since new, and I’d probably call him (man in his late 50s, lives on the country side) to ask about the car. Since he’s already sold the car to the dealership he has no incentives to sugar coat it.",Dacia

"Turbo issues are a general issue on most of the Renault build engines. I never owned a Dacia, I drove one tough, but it seemed to me to be a really simple car, and quite decent for the money also. However I used to own so far lots of cars with either Renault engines on them or be be a Renault brand, and from my experience with this brand was that you could either: 1. Have lots of electrical or weird computer problems or 2. Problems related to turbo or egr. The true is that most of the time these problems were cheap and fast to fix, which for me was a plus side. Many other brands (not all) are way more expensive with those issues (eg. German cars).

Actually i just sold my Qashqai j11 a few days a go, which had a 1.5diesel engine, brilliant engine… until started took engine oil more than diesel. Even tough that I maintained the car as per book said. But I hammered in it 50k miles/year in the past 3yrs. So yeah.. they’re deffo not very good at endurance/durability. I doubt that the newer Renault engines would do better. 

My personal advice would probably be to look at Suzuki options. From the cheap car market producers they’re by far the best you can find on many levels. At least from my personal experience. I own a Swift 08 plate from 5+years now, and I swear to God, is the best most fun, cheap and reliable car I ever had. Also they kept the same architecture to their engines, even on hybrid ones.",Dacia
"There is another option, if my memory is correct you could use the right stalk and switch through the setting till you find a little spanner on the instrument panel. This is car dependant but it's worth a shot

"Another thing that I'm not sure about as I can't seem to find much info about is the accelerator pedal.

Is it a ""two stage"" accelerator - I push my foot down,  it meets some resistance near the bottom, and then I can push it down right to the floor.  Not sure if I'm describing this correctly.  It's not catching on anything inside the vehicle.

My salesman unfortunately does not seem to know that much about the car he sold and he just said that was right (after first saying maybe the carpet is sticking!).

I mean, it feels OK and kind of makes sense that it's limiting you a bit from booting it and when you go past the ""notchy"" bit the car does boost to some extent.

I've had a look on the [daciaforum.co.uk](https://daciaforum.co.uk) and can't find much except this:

Someone there someone says their Sandero pedal is smooth and they should have it checked out.

There are other posts on pistonheads going back to 2014 talking about how the model then DOES have a two stage pedal so I'm really not sure about this - the one and only thing in the manual is about ""exceeding the limit speed"" if you have the speed limiter on and it mentions about pushing the pedal ""beyond the resistance point"".

Not sure if I should make a new post about this, but just want to make sure the pedal is as it should be.

- if you're using it mainly inside the city, the Stepway
- if you want boot space, the Duster

In the end, after the initial configuration, on the main menu, it should appear in the bottom right a new option - Android Auto if you have an Android phone or CarPlay if you connected an iPhone.

That's it - if you configured by mistake Android Auto/CarPlay on a different car, go into the settings of the phone and enable, again, everything.

"Any diesel fuel, even the “agricultural” or heating oil, meets european diesel standards and won’t cause problems in the 1.5 diesel, even the post 2018 ones with scr and euro6 norm. 
It’s more of a question where you buy it and how the gas station/seller stores it.

You would benefit from specific additives like the mannol range for diesel if you use heating oil/non-taxed diesel, but generaly you shouldn’t see any problems. 

More problems arise from short low rev drives when the engine doesn’t heat up or the DPF can’t complete the regeneration cycle. This engine needs a druve on the open road with sustained speeds over 80km/h with already warmed up engine at least a couple of times per month. 

Low rev rides also cause EGR valve to get stuffed. Both are general modern diesel problems. 

I’d also invest in the EGR checked and cleaned. You don’t know if the former owner did it or how they drove the car. For DPF to be sure it’s regenerated I’d do a longer high speed trip. 

An oil change wouldn’t hurt too. If it’s a “blueDCi” version with 115 HP it’s a RN17 5W-30  C3 spec oil, and even RN17FE 0-w20 C5. But you’d probably be better off with the RN17.

The ONLY rational reason to buy a Duster is for 4x4. And so the design should be made for the 4x4. 

But it increasingly isn't - it's trying to increasingly look and behave like a roadster - just higher up. 

There is some real life practical drawbacks in the design. 

For one the approaching angle is far worse on the 2024 than the old one meaning it is less capable in 4WD application. the engine also has 30 Nm less torque again a drawback in 4WDing

So yeah - now you can have a car that you personally might think looks better but it has less space than the Jogger, and is less capable than the 2023 model.",Dacia

"The thing is electric cars *can* be made cheap. Just the European manufactures don’t know how to, or don’t want to sell them cheap. In the case of the Spring the car costs only 7000$ in China, at least for the original model. But was sold at over 20k€ in some markets, because there was simply no competition in the small EV market. As for the case of battery degradation, it’s not a big problem for cars with bigger batteries of course because the cycles are much lower for the same mileage. But LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) batteries are both much cheaper, use less rare materials and last far longer than traditional NMC cells as used in the Spring for example. At the cost of lower energy density, leading to a heavier car for the same capacity. This is the technology that the E-C3 uses, with almost double the capacity of the Spring and a much bigger car for 23k€.",Dacia

"That’s exactly my criticism. The Duster should be about 4WD and not SUV … in actual fact the only purpose of a raised car with less size inside really is 4WD. So SUV should always have a 4WD option. Except they don’t. Duster was an exception in Europe.

And the Duster was really quite capable as a 4WD - that’s what made it great.

If the Duster is no longer about 4WD then why is there even a Sandero ? 

The new design basically is a 🖕to what made it great.

Not only have they chosen not to improve what needed improvement, by the looks of it they made it worse and also are making it quite clear that they don’t care about the nerds that supported the Duster so far. 

It reminds a bit of when Apple dropped all useful connectivity on their pro laptops and then pros had to carry a dongle for everything. Apple backtracked after 7 years - but don’t think we’ll ever get a Duster again that will be made to be a good 4WD car. 

Don’t get me wrong even the new one will be okay … but the direction is clear now. And that is sad.

In Europe if you want a capable 4WD as a co Sumer you only ever had the Duster. Or you are paying a bomb for an electronics focused Defender or something which OTT in cost and actually terrible in terms of reliability (you can’t tow it for more than 10 mins otherwise you break the gearbox - if you tow it for longer you need a flatbed - that sort of silliness).

Second issue is that the automatic gearboxes are CVT which are known for being unreliable and overall shitty, they're not your typical auto gearbox and are more complicated and hence have a higher tendency to break.  

Overall it's not a good idea to get an automatic Dacia unless you have money and won't care if the gearbox can break after a few years.

"Of course it has everything to do with 4WD.

The only purpose of a Duster is the 4WD. 

Why would you even consider a 4x2 Duster?? The Jogger is about the same length and width (3cm longer), has more internal space, and has almost the same clearance (1-2cm lower). 

There is no good reason to buy a car that has less space inside for the same volume unless it serves a purpose... 

And the purpose of the Duster - and only purpose is that it is 4WD capable.

All other arguments would be simply about personal preferences and optics. There is no rational reason apart for 4WDriving to buy a Duster. 

And in terms of 4WD the new Duster's design has some real drawbacks - lets go a bit deeper: 

- The approaching angle is very questionable, Duster 3 has 31\* at the front and 36\* at back vs 30 and 33 on the Duster 2 - the lower the better. So the Duster 2 is much better (that's the fatness at the front you can see it with you bare eyes - the design is to make it more of a sportswear and you can see it - the point though, it's not a sportscar - its 4wd too different application !) 

- We only have one engine left for the 4WD and the specs are not promising.  It has 30Nm less than the 1.3 TCE 150  - so to have the same off-roading experience you need to pack at least 10% lighter

- The number at the front will just brack at any impact - now even the old one would require some plating of serious 4WD - but the new one basically nothing is usable 

The one thing the 3 has for it is a classic parking brake - given it isn't automatic that will be helpful.",Dacia

"Yes, this is it.

Although tjat would be a departure from Dacia way too. Dacia sabes on gimmicks like infotainment and materials that are fancy but demanding for upkeep but delivers in a “car” department. Seems loke EV isn’t an arena where they can compete in the same way they did. And I can understand why. Battery Eav technology isn’t good. It is forced upon us to accept it as a worse alternative because it cannot be cheap and plainly isn’t a good alternative to ICE based vehicles. It could have its place though for those that have their own house where they can charge it and for errands about town/workplace. But a forced replacement of ICE via bannng sales of new ICE cars or maling fuel impossibly expensive by banning dyno fuels or limiting sales of it or taxing it punitively - that will mean the end of Dacia and the end of affordability of peraonal mobility. Dacia comes out of the cwntury of carmaking and is “back to the basics” brand that does very very tried tech and principles for a no-nonsense cars. Using amortised parts from the group it can be a cheap car. In EV arena it can struggle to do what it males it great.

"Yeah todays driving schools will teach you more on how to pass thw test then how to drive. Not using your gas to start is very bad, not teaching you how to use handbrake to start is expected bxos you cant pass your test if you use it to start but is very usefull in day to day so kinda dumb not to show the trick. 

1.0 is not diesel obviously so you can rev it a bit higher and shift higher,  and depends on the engine but lower rpm like it would be normal on diesel, lets say 1500rpm and engine could be a bit jerky if trying to accelerate bcos of lack of torque. This is very bad for small engines, avoid it. Downshift, more rpm more power. Those engines have timing chain that should be changed more often then its in the manual, also dont fail to change oil in proper intervals. Big older diesel and petrol engines with oversized parts can withstand a lot, these newer engines are more sensitive and will probably last but cant be pushed hard and  require more care.",Dacia

">From new, on cold engine, the car either jumps ahead or almost stalls. It is jerky to a point that it is very hard to start driving. Sometimes, it is fine and very pleasant to drive. Totally random. It happened also that the car started jerking when accelerating and then stalled, like it ran out of fuel. It then started normally and i was able to drive away, angry but unscathed.

That's (sadly) normal behaviour. Either let it idle longer, or give it more gas. Too many people are underrevving these engines.

>Since new, the electric windows randomly do not work. The only exception is the driver's window. It seems to be an electrical problem, because sometimes the door side switch moves the window (but the master switch does not). It seems that the problem is more common in cold and damp weather.

Some of window mechanisms has to be replaced. Generally the driver's one.

>The engine gives of a metallic rattle, which is especially audible at low speeds in parking garages, especially when driving downhill and engine braking. It seems to be related to the turbo wastegate. Sounds like metal clanking to metal, having too much wiggle room somewhere...

"Hey just curious, I have the same engine why do you need to replace it?",Dacia
"When I say 4x4 it’s not just about the engine and transmission. The design is also relevant for physical needs such as departure angles.

All that said you could either expand the Sandero / Spring to have bigger versions. 

Or you could split the Duster in two different designs.

That would be fine and actually that would be a great solution. Why not make a (more expensive) but really 4x4 focused Duster … That would be ultra cool.",Dacia
"I have no idea what 65 plate means.

I’m 65kg but have removed the seats and use it to transport heavy items (furniture etc) and have no issues in it. I mostly use it for car camping though and that’s up to an additional 120kg with gear, bed setup and my partner if she comes and it doesn’t struggle at all. All the capacity gives you options. The duster for me was too small and too high up, whereas the Jogger is my perfect car really!

The one we are getting is from 2022, as far as I can tell it’s basically the same dimensions as the ones sold new now. Can’t wait until they update the Sandero with the same design as the new Duster and the new Spring, the Sandero looks good now, but the new Duster and Spring both look amazing.

"I understand your argument but doubt it. There is a limit to how cheat the batteries can get. There’s still a lot of mining and material gathering involved that doesn’t seem to have mich space to cheapen. At least with current chemistry and I’m not aware of any feasable different prospectives on the horizon. Maybe diferent battery management software can live adapt power draw from them but that’s it regarding longevity. I personaly can’t buy this progressivist argument that technology necessarily moves forward in every field. Tech could move forward but I don’t think that’ll happen in batteries. I think we can look forward to minor improvements here, but price will remain relatively high in improved battery packs. 

And that still doesn’t address the power grid from where they’ll charge. Higher total electricity consumption plus electricity transport network and grid issues are still unresolved and mean massive investments that cinsumers will have to absorb on top of everything. Combine that with the irational push for renewables that are a problem for grid stability themsleves, plus governmental push for heat pumps (I also use one in my home), this is moving in the direction of a perfect storm. I fear of energy poverty and lesser availability of private personal mobility and I fear that won’t sit well with the people. And that fuels populist parties - eg. German example. 

Open mind is good, always. Strong social experimentation on the other hand isn’t. I’d have zero problems with BEVs if they weren’t mandated in near future because replacement of vehicles (done in the way it is planned) will drag with it wider problems (car mechanics are getting scarcer already for example) and what I see are aocial inplications that we cannot foresee but seem dangerous to me.",Dacia
Its quite loud crunch and it only happens occasionally its the same sound cars make if you try to put into gear without clutch. Mine is 2022 sandero 3 with 28k km. Bright side is it has not made the sound in couple days now. It was for sale for 6 months so maybe was just lack of use.,Dacia

"Yeah, I am sure there is probably a way. If not even a very easy way to make a button that starts the camera as you said i also imagine a switch that's ""clicked"" when you put the lever in reverse.    I'm sure they didn't put a button on purpose so either idiots don't break the camera somehow and then complain to the service, or so the car doesn't feel too premium since it's a Dacia and they don't want to give us too many extras for a smaller price or something.   At least that's how I explain it now, after reading the comments here.  
A similar, albeit bigger thing is how they don't make all of the models 4x4 and that's exclusive only to the most expensive one.  My Journey has almost every extra apart from the 4x4 which sucks pretty badly.  
Or how the lpg models don't have automatic gearbox and so on.  They made it pretty tricky and we had to really think about what version to buy.
Now when I think about it - another thing I hate is how you don't have momentary consumption on LPG  but I'll stop since I'm going way too off-topic. Still at least we have some buttons like the one that turns off automatic engine shutdown, some other brands I tried didn't have such an easy way to turn off that feature.   Overall I'm still happy with the car just some small things that boggle my mind.",Dacia

Sometimes its not running from the first time. It runs and then goes down. 
The Sandero is only 10k KM. Total bullshit is this car. 

2. And if you think that only the engine is a problem....come on. NO. 
The gearbox. When you try to shift the gear you need to overcome effort to put the gear ""on right place"". Its like old cars without synchronization.

"They keep a 4x4 option, but it uses the mild hybrid engine (1.2 three cylinder 130HP TCe engine), that is as best, a engine for city and plain roads. Is very far from the performance of the DCi and the 1.3 four cylinder 150HP TCe engines used in the actual 4x4 Dusters.",Dacia
"What are you talking about? And why don’t you answer my feedback instead on the NCAP rating? I feel you are very rude now. But I might be misunderstanding you. 

Is it really so hard to accept that 
A: Either people need two cars, or 
B: People have one car but for whatever reason is getting rid of it and looking for a new, cheaper car, and that they need a cheaper car for a range of personal reasons which is irrelevant. 

For me personally I had a really good leasing contract from my work, the contracts ends this spring. And my company has gotten rid of the good contracts to save money during these harder times. Therefore no new nice car if we don’t want to pay twice as much and full price. So we are getting a Dacia for some time, for a couple of months we will therefore have two cars also.",Dacia

"Ssangyong Korando costs more or less the same, and offers more equipment and noticeably better manufacturing quality. Realistically, the only reason to buy Duster 4x4 these days is slightly higher clearance. Which needs maybe 1 buyer out of 10.

Suzuki Vitara costs also the same money as Duster. 

Not to mention that Ssangyong also makes Tivoli 4x4, for 4500€ less than Duster. There are also smaller Suzuki's. 

Dacia needs to step up the game with the new Duster. The days of Duster being the cheapest 4x4 are long gone, and so are the days where Dacia could downplay the subpar quality by ""it's cheap"". 

They need to offer more while keeping the price the same.

Don't get me wrong, Duster still is competitive, especially the LPG version is unmatched if you seek to minimalize the running cost and for some reason need a SUV. But the 4x4... not worth it.",Dacia

"Yes.

I've had two dusters.  First was a 2015 dusters from new to 2020 and the only thing I needed to do was replace the front springs. It was the 2wd version and I wasn't very kind to it. No issues at all. Took a year out with a new Citroën c4 Cactus which was horrendous.  Door handles stopped working, rear window was loose, engine faults, the screen took up to 5 minutes to start working.  After less than a year I traded it for a new 4wd duster, which I have now had two years with no (major) issues. 
Minor issues: paint at rear door required to be redone after it had cracked. Fuel gauge would read higher than the amount of fuel, although the fill fuel light came on anyway. Both fixed under warranty. 

Really like the car. Will probably replace with a Duster EV when they become available.",Dacia

"Just look at all the unnecessary stuff that’s in it. 

Got nothing to do with real 4WD. It’s a city car.

Give us a basic 4WD, with diff locks and a proper engine - and get rid of heated seats, and all that nonsense electronics.

As I said at least the Dacia was fairly basic but now it’s increasingly trying to become another VW.

Edit: and you know what; if the Landcruiser 70s series was available to buy then I wouldn’t care … but EU legislation just pushes as a continuous flow of useless SUV’s - most of them just cars with ground clearance and no 4WD capabilities - rather than supporting small cars for the masses and very utilitarian 4WDs for those who actually appreciate what 4WD and ground clearance is for. 

The Duster has A single 50% 4WD option without an Auto Gearbox - but also missing diff locks and a powerful engine. 

At least it is FAIRLY cheap - that much I give you. But too expensive for what it is actually capable for thanks to city drivers who buy the Duster in a 4x2 version (just why?)",Dacia

On the left you have the diferential settings for 4x4 2wd etc(don't have one so i don't know how that works maybe check the book that came with the car...or youtube...dacia had some videos about systems on the car etc)

I’ve had constant problem with this, you never know when the unit transfers the data needed for updating on computer. It always concluded the slow process fine and showed no sign the process had failed somehow. It also hasn’t been interrupted in any way.

">It is supposed to spray and burn the soot in dpf via the 5th nozzle and fan does something while this is going on.

You're right - this happens ONLY while the engine is turned on. 

Why ? Because the regeneration must be supervised !

Why ? Because you're forcing the engine to produce a very high temperature on the exhaust and if something goes wrong, it might start a fire, might burn somebody passing near the rear nozzle etc.

Think about this situation - you drive home, park the car inside the garage and the car is still doing the regeneration, inside the closed garage. Practically, if it's how you say, you wouldn't be allowed to park it until the process is finished because you will intoxicate yourself. Or even better, you park, keep the garage door open so the gases go out, get inside the house and at some point, some malfunction appears and the car starts a fire. Because we're talking about pumping fuel and lighting it up in order to produce heat. Practically, you wouldn't have a kill switch (in this case, turning off the engine).

That's why even if you force a regeneration via the diagnostic job, inside a workshop, you need to have somebody supervising the process. You don't just turn on the engine, connect the diagnostic tool and leave it unsupervised.

"I've a similar issue in reverse taking a 2023 Duster to Europe,  the dip lamp on mine is an led lamp, not so easy to place a sticker, the advice I've found is to park facing a wall at night a few meters away, dip beam on and look to block the light that effects what would normally be your nearside of the road, in my case left hand side, the other advice is to in a UK case go to an MOT test garage and ask them to do this using their beam alignment machine,

"Yep, I was thinking this, however I did manage to get the price down a little by taking in some internet quotes so I wouldn't want to be paying any more - if anything I'd be looking for some kind of goodwill gesture anyway because of all the hassles.  Three times I've had to go back to the dealer in the week I've had it just because I want to make sure they know what's going on as they weren't acknowledging my emails.

I don't know if you are in the UK, but the good thing is, if I give them the chance to fix it, instead of getting my money back, then they've had their one chance to make it right and I'll have the first 6 months where I can then return it if it doesn't look like it should.

I don't expect them to be able to do anything about the couple of marks under the paint on the bonnet - are they going to take the whole bonnet off and respray it?   Goodness knows what it would look like after that, I'm not wanting to end up with an orange peel effect.

My main issue is the tints I have to say, the car is not as advertised, and there is no way I'm having them taking the doors etc to bits to fit the right windows, that'll be a creaking fest for ever after that and I do intend to keep the car for some time, which is why we bought it outright and new - I didn't intend to end up with a Frankenstein car.

I'll start chasing things up at a higher level tomorrow if I haven't heard anything constructive from the dealer about how they are going to make this right.",Dacia

"Quicker charging means strain on battery longevity. If they had fluid cooling bigger draw from battery (better driving characteristics) as well as quicker charging would be possible. I agree range isn’t necessariliy a big problem per se. It does however add to a vehicle not being attractive enough.

I generaly don’t think battery EVs are the tech to go for and I think whatever success the cars based on this tech have is due to government pressure theough regulation, a push for something worse and rudden with problems which it then solves with creating other problems etc. etc. and with little effect to the environment on a global scale.

>Plus I think there's 6 or 7 years extended warranty on every car.

That's not the point of the warranty...but if you like having you car in the shop for the same problem over and over again, it's your choice.

It's funny that Renault didn't do the ""fix"" that VAG Group did with their petrol engines (TFSI) - write in the user manual that it's a completely normal phenomenon to loose 1L at each 1000 km. Basically, at each revision, you don't need anymore to change the oil because it's brand new !",Dacia
"I have 3 kids and bought the Jogger right at launch because of it.

I only use 1 ISOFIX chair, otherwise I wouldn't be able to use the third row. The other chair is fixed with seatbets alone and the oldest child doesn't need chair anymore, just a little stoll to get a bit taller on the seat.

Depending on your kids age, you may be able to out all the kids in the second row, like I did, but the only way I was able to do that was by using a narrower stoll for the oldest and she sits next to the door. That way the youngest is more protected in the middle seat and I can easily access the third row for more people.

"From 2018 dusters with blue dci started to roll out. Regarding the scr system - it would be interesting to see if there are different implementations and components on those engines - renault’s k9k 87x and mercedes’s om 608.

"> Any diesel fuel, even the “agricultural” or heating oil, meets european diesel standards and won’t cause problems in the 1.5 diesel, even the post 2018 ones with scr and euro6 norm. It’s more of a question where you buy it and how the gas station/seller stores it.

Don't forget to repeat this mantra when you are replacing the injectors before 100k km. Or the entire fuel system after you filled it from the jerry can with biodiesel you found in the garage.

Fun story: A contruction company nearby bought ""agricultural/bio"" diesel. Before they realized it's bad, it ruined an excavator, dumper truck, two vans and a Duster. 19,000€ in repairs.

Farmers buying modern diesel cars, just so they can cheap out on fuel, is evergreen of the last years. And it keeps on giving.

>More problems arise from short low rev drives when the engine doesn’t heat up or the DPF can’t complete the regeneration cycle. This engine needs a druve on the open road with sustained speeds over 80km/h with already warmed up engine at least a couple of times per month.

I understand this topic is about Qashqai, but I've never seen Dacia with failed DPF. Well, except the guy who drove for 5000 km and half a year with the warning light on, turning a 150€ repair into 1500€. Even people who used them mostly for less than 10 km trips. Zero issues.

>Low rev rides also cause EGR valve to get stuffed. Both are general modern diesel problems.

Again, doesn't happen on Dacias. I've seen one or two leaking EGR coolers, but that's it.

Anyway, OP appears to be from Morocco, so I have no idea what kind of reasoning he has for diesel-only. But at least he will be able to rip out emission equipment once it fails, so diesel still might make sense for him - for EU drivers it's no longer the case.",Dacia

"The latest models are great cars for what they are. Robust plastics you don’t have to worry about, practical, nice finish, no crickets from the construction while driving. The 4x4 diesel is reasonably powerful and can be very frugal on regular roads uf yoy dobt force it, but doesn’t get very thirsty even if you do. The entertainment ststem NeduaNav is basic but functional, no “nonsense”. Ut has wireless carplay and androud auto, and also built in bluetooth functionalities for making calls or navigating (with 3 years of free maps updates) if you dob’t want to use phone mirroring for any reason. And that at the same time is what all of the car is about. If you, like me, value and take enjoyment from that fact - than you’ll love it.

There are some things that aren’t perfect as they are, though. 
- Seats are comfortable and all but could be firmer. In bottom position adjustment the driver’s seat feels like it has a little play. The fron passenger seat in its back most position produces a sound when driving if nobody’s sitting on it. Moving it one notch forward stops the noise.
- the rubber door seal in the front most part tends to get punctured by the edge of the door when they close. Something they’ll have to sort during warranty period and I already showed it to the mechanic.
- the windows can’t be opened or closed if the engine isn’t running, which I found a bit odd.
- there are no rear air vents for passengers from the middle console between front seats and the compartmend under the front armrest isn’t cooled by the AC, it’s just a compartment. There are vents under the front seats directed towards the rear footwell.
- not exactly a critique but a 4x4 has different shifting ratios with the first gear meant to be useful offroad, but normally you start with second gear. The transmission does have a little too much rpm at 130 km/h in 6th gear (about ~2700 if I remember correctly). 
- it is still a little noisy at motorway speeds, mostly wind and road noise
- the trunk plate/floor that covers the spare wheel is a joke. I mean … words cannot describe this pathetic object in there. It’s a thin wooden plate, very shabbily clad with felt. From the top it isn’t aparent that much, but when you look in the spare tyre compartment and lift it you see the sorry state it is made. I can’t imagine why making a solid car in every way, but then putting that piece of crap in. I don’t think a respectable alternative would cost that much more.
- the piece under that floor plate is made out of molded white styrofoam. Which also doesn’t inspire confidence in longevity. I don’t know what a similar alternative could be, but that isn’t the finest feature either, and I don’t think the costs would have significantly changed if they used something else.
- not exactly a critique but body roll is present and it is worse than on a BMW x3 :)) but the ride is very comfortable. It’s just not a racer and it doesnt bother me because I don’t drive it in a way that that would be a problem. I know why I have a higher body clearance car, and why a sporty firmer suspension would not work well for me.
- the Media Nav system works fine and is a no fuss, well thought out simple but all-the-features-you-need system with very good legibility and logic, but can sometimes have a mind of its own, although very very rarely. Especially when updating it via usb key. They have now made it easyer for android phone users because the updating process is done via their phones with an app instead of the usb key. The latter method simetimes does not record the neccessary data on the usb key and when you try to download updates - you cant because it’s empty. The process of recording data pn the key in the car is slow and it’s a drag if it’s unsuccessful when you bring it home and see it’s empty and you cant download updates to it. And I have done everything right 100%. It’s just a quirk the system has. Phone updates work flawlessly I hear, but I have an iphone so for now no option for updates for me.",Dacia

The 12V DC port would then be used as 5V DC power supply for something else via a car charger.

What would get dirty and clogged sooner with a lot of low rpm driving is the EGR valve, a diesel owners favorite and one of the top reasons for having to take the car into a shop.

But I agree the Eco function has limited use. Yeah, maybe if I feel like it on a longer suburban drive, I’d turn it on once in a while.

">The regeneration continues after engine is stopped

In order to do a successful regeneration, or to even start it, you need 2 things : a very high temperature (over 600 degrees) and a constant RPM. How can you keep both mandatory conditions with the engine stopped and the radiator fan going ? 😂

The fan keeps going after you turn off the engine to do the sole thing that it can - cool off something by circulating the coolant (turbine after a long drive on the highway, a particle filter after it finished the regeneration or it may indicate a problem with the cooling system).

>The mechanic at the dealer told me that the 10-15 minute fan going on after stopping the car is a sign it is finishing regen on DPF

What the mechanic said here is what I explained above - after the successful (or not) regeneration process, because of the high temperature, if you turn off immediately the engine, the fan keeps going in order to cool down the whole exhaust, were the particle filter is also situated.

Pure and simple.",Dacia

"Sandero is definitely more reliable and provides better money/value ratio.

Duster 2 is pretty much just a bigger facelift of Duster 1, which makes it a sibling of first Logans and Sanderos. The quality is subpar by today's standards, despite all the polishing Dacia made to justify the price increases.

The Duster 3, which should arrive next year, may change it. But as of right now, unless you are looking for offroad 4x4 vehicle, Duster isn't competitive anymore.",Dacia

Also the H5H is more reliable. The K9K is ruined by the AdBlue, which is constantly crapping itself. And it's not the only issue. FAP pressure sensor tends to melt itself. The glow plugs last ridiculously short time. The preheating of coolant is ridiculously complicated and tends to fail.

"Renault mechanic checking in here (Dacia are Renault). 

Common problem on them, 99% chance the rubber bungs under the scuttle panel are clogged with leaves. Field fix is to set wipers to park position, remove wipers, partially remove scuttle panel (plastic cover just at the bulkhead in engine bay), there should be a few torx screw and some plastic clips, at which point it should be apparent and holding water. If so feel around for the bungs (located in far corners, no you can't see them, but you can push them down and through which will immediately alleviate the water.

"Yes exactly this on my 2019 Duster 4x4. Not the doors (as others have suggested); it's from the air intake. I've cleared leaves, but I have a feeling it's just a poor design. When the car is left outside in heavy rain (there's been a lot of this lately), it can get into the cabin air inlet. The water comes in during the first minute or so of a journey. Always on the left (passenger side). It can be seen running down from the area below the glove box.

Also I get a noise like sand being shaken side to side at the same time, that I think is probably related. That seems to come from the air inlet area under the bonnet too. I live down a stony track though so I guess you might not hear that if you have a smooth start.

I'm still within the 6 month dealer guarantee (second hand), and it's only really shown up bad in the recent wet weather, so I'm considering taking it back for them to fix it, but the dealer is 100km away so I'd rather not have to. And if it is simply a design fault (air intake area not adequately shielded from rain) then there's not a lot they could do about it.

I first noticed this in the back seats well, but I've since realised it simply ran through from the front because of the angle the car was at.",Dacia

There only are the two trims available in the UK.

And it does list the window tint at 25% for the Expression so I don't think it's wrong for me to expect that.

"Duster was never made with 4x4 in mind. From the very beginning 4x2 version was outselling 4x4. Duster was launched when SUVs started to become popular in Europe but due to high price inaccessible for more budget conscious customers. It perfectly filled 'affordable SUV' niche.

Yes, marketing was and is offroad centric, and Duster is widely recognized as great 4x4 car. But it represents small % of all cars sold. In countries were LPG is popular ECO-G engines are 80-90% of all Dacia sales (according to my local dealer). 

Dacia, in general, is trending toward positioning itself as 'outdoor' brand rather than generic 'affordable' brand. And that affects its price competitiveness. But they have no choice. None of the European brands will be able to compete on price with Chinese. 

It's still targetting the same group of customers in need of mid-sized affordable SUV. And those needing 4x4 have an option to purchase one as well.",Dacia

"Update:

I've got a reply from the official importer.

They were in contact with my dealer. As it appears, they think that all of the listed problems are imaginary and that I should return to the dealer for service if i think something is wrong with the vehicle. They seem to be a bit offended, because they ""always took my car in under warranty"", as in what more do I want? I want my car to function. That is all.

I will ask the dealer to write a statement that the car is in perfect working order as they seem to believe. I will hand over that statement to the buyer when I sell the car and keep a copy for myself in case it comes to lawsuits later on.

I hope potential buyers of this car read this and avoid a bad purchase. After all, 20k eur buys a decent car of a more reputable brand that takes care of their customers.",Dacia

On lpg engine has more torque and power and better price per 100 km as well. As fuel prices here are rising, lpg price drops a little bit, at the moment 100km in city, with bad traffic jams costs around 5.60 euro, highway smth around 3.60-3.70.",Dacia

"In Poland we call that turbodziura (Turbo-hole) - that moment of low power just before turbo kicks in. I just don't think that it's pronounced in 100hp Sandero, but my previous car was 150hp so maybe I am just used to much bigger turbo effect.",Dacia
"It's a big car, it'll be more then enough for your space needs. If you'd want the ground clearance maybe see if there's a Stepway variant available. It'll be a bit more expensive though.

The 'problem' that I'd see with this car is that you're paying about half of the original price for a car that's about halfway to its expected end. See, depreciation hits 'cheap' cars differently. In about 50k you can expect some more maintenance coming up that comes with mileage, which can range from mild, the ball joint bearing sleeve, to more expensive, the control arm.

For about 2k more you should be able to get a far younger example. But, if you are able to keep more money in the pocket to reserve for maintenance that's also very nice.

Have it checked by another garage (pre purchase inspection) would be an advice. They'll also check if it's been maintained according to the manual and be able to tell you what maintenance will be coming up. At 8 years its probably due for brake fluid, spark plugs, engine coolant. Or if that's all been done, that's great. But you could be able to tell by looking into the service manual and the maintenance records. 

Tl:dr, if a bit younger car is in the cards, that would be great, if not, have it checked before purchase so you know if there's problems and what kind of maintenance to expect.",Dacia

So if you buy a car in Romania at (I don’t know) 19% and no additional taxation, you’ll pay the difference at home upon registration plus any special taxes for vehicles if they exist in your home country.

"Quick update:  
The seatbelt mechanism that was replaced a bit over a month ago died again. I think i need to go back to driving school, because obviously i'm doing something wrong. Either that or Dacia quality is #hit....

The car also began to randomly not start (maybe once in 5 to once in 8 startups), so i basically need to turn the key off and repeat the starting sequence and hold the key for longer, having the starter motor run for up to 10 seconds before the thing starts to chooch. Oh, and yes, the car now randomly shuts down when driving on cold engine, which is a nice bonus.

The service just shruggs off my complaints, saying we have to wait for firmware updates from the manufacturer or some other excuse.

My family had three new dacias and two new renaults up until now, but I will never buy another dacia/renault again. I cannot even sell this thing because i would either have to lie about car not having any issues which is morally not an option or sell it for half price because it obviously has some major problems that will eventually bring major costs to fix them.

I dont wanna say that service did a bad job, because, after reading the ODB errors, and during this time pressing the clutch, it said something like ""Pedal not pressed"" or something what did not represent the fact (clutch was pressed or not pressed and ODB displayed ""clutch pressed/nor not pressed"", cant remember, but it showed definitely the counter part), so logically the service thought it must be the clutch sensor. So, althought it might be due to broken brake switch, and although my brake light always lighting up when braking, the issue lays with that switch. But why my brake lights always did their job?

"It depends on your confidence, skills, and budget.
I'm not too sure about the stock sound dampening and insulation in the spare tire well, doors and back hatch. But having that dampened and insulated will help alot and should always be done before or together with swapping out speakers.

Good speakers can be had for 50-90 a piece and that's for good to very good quality. 
Pro quality goes further then this and will require more hardware. Having it done just the speakers is anywhere between 400 and 1000.

Sound dampering is about 50-250 per door depending on quality. You will need some simple tools as well as spare plugs for the interior trim.
Having this done can be anywhere from 1000 tot 3000 depending in quality and the area you want covered.

Generally a basic speaker upgrade and basic sound dampening will cost 800-1500 to get done professionally.",Dacia

"Go to a dealership and try to sit in each car and see how comfortable it is.I'm 1.84m and if I set the driving position to where it's comfortable for me (basically the seat all the way back), then there's absolutely no room for anyone in the backseat behind me. This is the case for the Jogger, Duster and Sandero stepway, with the addition that headspace for a sandero stepway is pretty small (I was actually banging my head against the ceiling a couple of times, and I'm shorter than you). I tried out the one with the sunroof, maybe it's better for the ones without.

So in terms of headspace, forget the Sandero stepway and go either for Duster or Jogger.

The practical difference between the Duster and Jogger is that the Duster sits higher up (by 2cm) and has a smaller booth (about 470L for the LPG version, \~1600L with the seats folded down). I think that's still pretty decent. Not sure about the boot space for the Jogger but it's definitely bigger.

In terms of weight, both vehicles weigh about the same.

With the 1.0L engine they might be a bit sluggish, but honestly that depends on your preferences. It's fast enough that you can overtake safely (given enough space), and you can get up to highway speeds relatively quickly. I test drove the Duster with the 115 HP diesel engine (they didn't have the LPG one for test drive) and it was honestly fine. Its easy to drive, fuel consumption is great, but don't expect it to be a race car. Also, you'll have to get used to the engine a bit, it likes to get revved up and puts down the most power at aroun 4-5k RPM. Just make sure that you break in the engine first before your start going to town on it (<3k RPM for the first \~1k kilometres).

I also test drove a Logan with the same engine (1.0 with LPG) and that was also fine, just bear in mind that the Logan is about 100k lighter.

If you want something that's a bit more powerful, then consider the Dusters with the more powerful engines or the hybrid jogger. These are going to cost a bit more and have a bit of a smaller boot space (Duster), not sure about the Jogger.

EDIT: My recommendation is that you go to a dealer and see for yourself. Set the driving position to where it's comfortable for you and then try to sit in the backseat behind the driver. See how it feels, how much space you have. Also bring someone a bit shorter with you to see if they would fit comfortably behind you. That way you know how many people you could realistically lug around.

&#x200B;

EDIT2: One thing I forgot to mention. With the seats folded down, you have about 170cm space in the Duster for long items. In the jogger it's about 180cm (but this also depends on how far back you put the front seats).",Dacia

I'll need to get this confirmed and all I can do is send yet another email to the dealer so it's all in writing within the first 30 days.

Turns out my wife knows someone that has their own car window tinting business so they will be able to say for sure about the windows, hopefully I'll get along there later today.

If the oil level gets reduced only while the car is used, then at what kilometre intervals does it happen and how much gets consumed? For example is it 100ml every 10k kilometres, 500ml every 1k kilometres, etc.?

"Doubtful it will be in that range as it was over that range even now. 
Also while I like what I see in everything to do with the car, I don’t like what they offer in the engine selection department. Only a three cilinder for a 4x4 version? Diesel lovers of the old Dusters wanting to upgrade will cry. If it was at least the old 4 cilinder TcE 130 or even better the TcE 150! They’re not as economical as the excellent diesel but at least are proper engines.

And is that 1.6 naturally aspirated engine in the hybrid 140 version the ancient suboptimal engine from the older Dusters and Renaults? Now repurposed as an old already silly guy getting help from the electric motors?

Anybody who knows more about these engines or if I evaluate the engine selection wrong - please correct me!",Dacia

"Pressing the gas pedal stronger deactivates eco mode, says the manual.
I have used it extensively. I don’t see the 0.5 l lesser consumption. It may be that I drive more aggressively with it the feature on. The manual says it can benefit some types of driving (regional roads with limits and stopping as well as towns, I think). I found at the end I get practically the same consumption - maybe 0.1 l better. If. The engine is the diesel 1.5 115 blue dci. When I had the feature mostly on for 5000 km the average consumption showed 4.9 l / 100 km. Now it shows 5.0 after 4000 km. I drive some (small) town - ~25 km per month; then motorway with 130km/k limit - ~500 per month; local roads with 90/50 km/h limits - ~500 km per month.

I think with proper driving for the lesser power map one could get more saving out of it. I just don’t have it in me :) I didn’t find the lesser resposivness to be too much of a drag, but you can notice it. I do appreciate the better pull and dynamics with the feature off.",Dacia

Point 6 - Check Engine and Service lights randomly come on when outside temperature goes from positive to about -5C or lower. ""Check emission control system"" message also comes on.

"Hi, 
Dacia Sandero Stepway 3(2022) owner here,after 10k km since i have it here is my opinion.
First,the car is the best for the money...like the cheapest in my country for a new car...paid 12k euro for the bifuel 100hp petrol and lpg version,only option i dont have is the keyless package...for fuel consumtion you can get anything between 6.5L-11L/100km depending on conditions
 (eg. For city in winter for small 2-3km trips from a to b and letting the car there for 3-5 hours you can get 11...for highway driving you can get 7...those are Lpg numbers...
for petrol 8-10 city 5-6 highway)

Now...the quality is not stellar...don't expect bmw comfort...but that being said is quite nice and well designed ,i think is better then the fiat you have but that's just my opinion, to be sure test drive one.
Suspension is soft coming from a bmw ,but on bumpy roads is great...power is decent,not that slow like some people will say
Problems that i seen on forums...ac had some problems on some cars not working being low on freon or something , lpg sensor was recalled and changed at the first service on mine...other then that maybe the turbo rod someone told somewhere here but not that common i think, in my country anyway...
If you have warranty i think you wont have that much trouble...

As far as an electronics car goes it is pretty capable.

Now with that aggressive elegant look it’s clear where we are heading.

"It depends on the weight of the caravan and the towing capacity. Apparently both can tow 1500kg although I've found messages that say in '22 there was a 1200kg advice for the 2wd. 
I'd say if the car is to be your daily driver also, and your caravan is within the weights, it's not really going to matter and the 2wd would be preferable for daily use.

Edit: the '22 2wd can do 1200kg for the petrol and LPG versions. But somethings going on here because the older 1.6 does 1200 while a 2018 1.2tce can do 1500. 

The 4wd petrol versions seem to all be able to tow up to 1500kg.
Max towing capacity seems to be the same for diesel and petrol.


If you're just buying the car for towing I'd say diesel 4x4. Maximum low rpm torque from the diesel, offroad capable and you could pull your caravan from muddy fields like a champ. 
A gasoline 4x4 would miss that juice diesel power.


But realistically you're not going to do all that.
So more realistic would be 2wd diesel, great torque, more fuel efficient when towing then the gasoline.
But only if your caravan weight is within allowances.

But this depends also on the country you're in. Some countries charge insane road tax for diesel making it almost cheaper to rent one just for your holiday then owning one. And there's potentially emissions zones that could cause an headache.


If you're really keeping daily use in mind, the 2wd gasoline would still be more then fine.

But what about Bigster? Did they scrap it? A larger SUV with 4x4 and suited for police and firefighters would make sense maybe?",Dacia

But lower range does not have to be an issue, if Dacia can provide quicker charge it should be fine as you can just plug it and keep driving soon again. I have a Polestar 2 long range and have come to realize it’s such a waste. Sometimes we drive very long but still I could just as well charge it more often, have a lighter more efficient car and pay less. The day we can charge our cars from 20-80 in 5-10 minutes it will be excaptable with smaller batteries, which makes them cheaper, more efficient and our limited resources now lasts for more cars, which in turn will make the components even cheaper to source.",Dacia

Today, it's mostly solved. But few parts still remain unavailable - in Dacia it's famously the front headlights for some versions of Duster II (your case) - they ran out of stock in April 2022 and still aren't available.

"The NA engine is 65 (1.0 SCe 65) and the turbocharged 1.0 comes with 90 hp or 100 hp for LPG versions. At highway speeds you'll appreciate the turbocharged versions a lot.

Not sure about your financial situation nor the market you're looking in; my advice would be the 1.0 TCe (90 or 100) and personally, I'd opt for Jogger rather than Logan.

All 3, Jogger, Sandero, and Logan are on the same low-spec B platform, so they'll be very similar in terms of comfort and handling.

Renault is putting the same stuff in Dacia as is in Renaults, Nissans, and lately in the Mitsubishis (rebadged Renaults).

If you're not sure how to inspect the car, ask in your area for a mechanic that will be willing to have a look with you. It is an unpleasant cost, but it will help you avoid a much larger one on the long run.  


I wouldn't go for the 1.5 dCi; only exception is the 105/110hp version with Siemens injectors. And even I'd advise changing rod bearings before the car hits 200 000 km.",Dacia

The 1.0l engine is good, has never felt underpowered even with 7 adults in, so unless you need the auto then you'll likely never recoup the extra cost of the hybrid engine.

Reliability wise it's been perfect. I think they do a extended warranty too up to 5 years.",Dacia

Dealer look at it and they’re going to replace the lpg injector rail under warranty as it seemed to be only doing it while running on lpg and not petrol. 

But I also found out they haven’t been servicing the car right, no service on the lpg system and no spark plugs changed at 40k as they should have been, she’s at 46k now. Took it to the lpg mechanic my dad uses for his own cars, changed out the spark plugs and serviced the lpg system, new filters and cleaner through the system as he said dirt can be an issue causing them to stick. She’s running like a dream now. But I’ll let Dacia replace the rail on their dime anyway, may as well have a free new replacement.

"Dacia cars remind me off cheap company cars and courtesy cars etc or the back off the new one does look nice though but they are probably running old tech in them etc still , brands like Dacia  are common in the uk I can see the appeal as the extensive warranty on a cheap brand new car , or someone who doesn’t care about cars they are packed with everything you need ,  but they not a car persons car , as someone who enjoys driving i can’t see anyone saying they would rather have this over a German or Japanese suv ,
For suv style cars if they where my thing id go for a Kia or Hyundai some real nice spec models and they also have an extensive warranty I see them as brands that stopped making cars in the 2000z in the uk market anyway as in proton who made cars with old Mitsubishi parts though to give them credit they had one hot hatch at the era off the Saxo ,Corsa ,206 era 
Dacia uses old Renault parts and gm ,and they are not the cheapest car in the uk anymore so if I liked suv crossover style cars I’d opt Kia or Hyundai as your getting modern tech and a long warranty",Dacia
"Beware that Duster is not built for large people. If you are tall and/or fat, you will be packed in like a sardine in a can, which will make longer journeys a pain. And the seat mechanism will wear out very quickly, starting to creak and dangerously wiggle - replacement is about 600-700€, and it's the exact same mechanism, which will wear out again (to be fair, there was an improvement in 2021 (I think), but it's only slightly sturdier, definitely not a solved issue).

I cannot really recommend the 1.5DCi. The engine itself is not bad per se, older versions could reach 400-500k easily, but the emission devices are complete trash, failing constantly, especially in the AdBlue versions. Stay away from 1.2TCe at all cost. 1.6 SCe is weak and rather sad engine, prone to heavy oil consumption (unless fixed under warranty, otherwise nobody would want to dish out 3-4k€). 1.3TCe is much, much better choice than anything else. It has the most power and literary 0 issues.

"Well … I’d expect lower range with all the additional electronics and weight gain, sice it has the same power and capacity battery and motor.

Edit: Spring is cheap but not miraculously so - the mentioned competitors in the article - the BYD dolphin has a 60kWh battery and claimed range of 430km, while Citroën ë-C3 had a 44kWh battery and 320km range. Bys is ~26k€ and Citroën is ~23,5k€. Spring starts at - what? ~19k€? 

That means it isn’t really cheaper than the other two, but it is just a lower spec (regarding capabilities) car. Which is fine if you just need a in-town or inter-town and get-to-work car in the viccinity of your dwelling and don’t need the better capacity batteries or stronger motors that the other two have. 

But with the classic, ICE engined Dacias that wasn’t the deal: with a Dacia you got a decent powered engine taken from the current stock or Renault and powered similarly than the competition (of course without the higher power options) but still being the cheaper alternative to other cars in its size class. Dacia trimmed the cars back to the roots. In higher but still vompetitive specs you got a very good comfort standard equipment with not nonsene gimmicky stuff, just functionals. As a car they were comparable to the competition but cheaper. Yes they lacked better materials (depends how you look at “better” - I always preferred robust plastic to tender, fine trim because adults - women with handbags - and especially kids ruin them) and lacked some fancy electric and entertainment features, but as a car a Sandero was comparable drive to a Clio or a P 206 … it featured a bit higher ground clearance in even regular, non-stepway version, which was a good feature if you lived in the country or like picnics in nature. 

The electric version is just a lower power and capacity - and corelatively lower price - option of competitors, while the ICE Dacias were a better value for money cars, (with tricks gimmicks and fancywork).",Dacia

"Actually ""the market"" is a system made of moronic regulations, producers, and people.

There is nothing inherently within people that demand SUV's. It's EU regulation which made small cars way too expensive and SUV's profitable - by allowing bigger cars to emit more gases. It's a straight line too when actually reducing emissions is much harder than increasing weight. So car makers increase size / weight of all cars and the price point between a small car and a big car becomes so narrow that people go for the bigger car.

It is regulation that made small cars way heavier and more expensive requiring them to become more luxurious so that they can be sold at a higher price point. But by selling them at that higher price point the delta to a ""luxury"" / bigger car has become so narrow - you may as well go bigger.

It's all backwards.

It is oversimplified to say ""the market"" wants it. There simply isn't any alternative choice possible.

"* **Modern LPG systems** in Dacia Sandero are designed to switch between petrol and LPG automatically. You typically won't need to manually switch unless there's an issue with the LPG system.
* **Driving solely on LPG is generally safe** for the engine. However, **consult your Dacia user manual** for any specific recommendations. Some manufacturers might suggest occasional petrol usage to keep the fuel system components lubricated.

**Starting on LPG:**

* **No, Dacia Sanderos with LPG typically won't start directly on LPG.** They usually start on petrol and then switch to LPG automatically once the engine warms up. This ensures proper lubrication during the initial start-up phase.

**Gas Smell:**

* **A faint gas odor might be noticeable** during the first cold start, especially in winter. This is usually due to the system purging any residual gas. However, a strong or persistent gas smell indicates a potential leak, which requires immediate attention by a qualified mechanic.",Dacia

"Get as youngest as possible with 1.3TCe (best engine without any discussion) or 1.0TCe.

Stay away from 1.2TCe, it's not worth at any cost.

1.6SCe is either perfect engine which will run forever, or unreliable piece of shit. There's no way to tell which one you're buying, so it's better to stay away from it. Besides unguaranteed reliability, is sucks at every aspect anyway,

1.5DCi is not a bad engine, but it's much more expensive to maintain than other variants (except 1.2TCe), so it's not worth it.

As for 4x2, keep in mind that there's no way to disable ESP. So it's almost impossible to climb a hill covered in snow.

As for NCAP, the best source of information is the NCAP https://www.euroncap.com/en/results/dacia/duster/29898

Noteworthy weakness of Duster is that it's not made to accommodate tall and/or fat people. The driver's seat may wiggle because of it (700€). Other common point of failure is the gear lever not returning to neutral on it's own (400€).  Also check under the hood. For some reason, rodents love Dusters. Check the turbocharging hose on the top of the engine (300-400€), if there aren't any bitemarks in the rubber (might need to squeeze it a bit). Inspect before buying and try to negotiate discount if you spot something.

"I just saw a video of a 7 year old Renault Zoe, it’s battery was still at 89%. That is really old batteries that has held up great. We will likely/hopefully have a lot of new tech which makes quicker charging possible without degrading the battery. Alternatively cheaper batteries which can be replaced. 

I have read your comments here and I see you really don’t like the direction we are heading in. I usually think politicians should keep their dirty fingers away from the market. And I do think ICE will have some room in the future too. But ICE is very mature, not much can be done for efficiency. BEV tech is still very young and we will likely soon make tremendous strides in battery tech, both for safety, quick charging, capacity, longevity and price. The benefit of politician’s pushing BEV is that it has made car manufacturers pour money into BEV research which means new teach will be available sooner rather than later. I think without doubt we will get to a point within a decade where ICE just can’t compete on price compared to BEV, without any subsidies. At that point no more pressure is needed on the market, likely they don’t even need to forbid ICE cars since most people will simply buy BEV. The caveat here is of course that I am predicting the future now, and I could then of course be wrong, so it’s just my optimistic opinion. 

I personally have a Polestar 2 right now, long range. We lease it at a very affordable price from work, otherwise it had made no sense. Now our work is removing this benefit and then electric makes no sense anymore. So I am getting a gasoline Sandero instead 😛. 

If I might be bold and predict the future again I believe we might have one more ICE car after this one, then we will be buying a super-OK, affordable second hand BEV and never look back.",Dacia

"I would wholeheartedly reccoment them. Very well built (at least those coming from Romania), tried tech (but on the flip side no new stuff). Comfortable, easy to maintain and durable interior (especially seats in the current models - older models had seats that deteriorated quickly). They could easily inherit the VW slogan “Das Auto”, The Car. Because it is exactly that plus some perks in electronics - but no latest stuff.

What I would criticise is - but goes more to previous gen of models - the lack of trying to design interior that is versatile, has clever practical solutions for various stuff from storage to comfort inside. They already have ingeneers that adapt and use the catalog of Renault/Nissan parts and tech, research materials (saw a promo Dacia video) - it wouldn’t be such a big extra cost to give a task to male interior more geared to practicallity to them. That would make an incredible advantage. That would make them low cost, a little out of step with the tech race, but functional and proven tech, with great usability solutions - where it matters: the everyday use. They already are the former but lack a bit in the latter
They did start to implement some stuff in the current models: for example the phone compartment/ledge that can modularly be converted into inductive charging phone ledge. Then there’s the boot based collapsable sleeping bed for the Jogger, and modularity regarding another two seats in Jogger. There could be more stuff that costs cents but gives big value to users: little differebtly molded door trims that have usable compartments for different stuff, or especially the front part between front seats and under the controls. Plus  there could be more innovative practical stuff in the boot… etc.",Dacia

"For the money and reliability, I'd consider buying a Suzuki S-Cross or Vitara as well. Same kind of utility. Great reliability. But a bit more mature as the generation of Duster you're looking at isn't that much more evolved from the first generation. Meaning it's going to be a bit more basic (and louder on the inside) then the comparable Suzukis. Now I don't care about that too much for myself but driving with our baby was kind of shitty until we got a quieter car, apparently she hated the excess noise.

For your conditions and mileage you may be right to go petrol. On the other hand if LPG is avaible in your area a Duster with bi-fuel LPG may do your wallet a big favour.

If you're not going off road, 4x4 can be somewhat of an advantage in heavy snow. But have you ever missed that capability in your current Rio?
Good quality winter tires will be as much of a factor or more in how well your car does in winter.

Then finally, you could do very well with an bit older Volvo station and they're plenty over there. But it comes with more expensive maintenance. 
Safety will be top notch though.

In closing, you'll have to study what the NCAP really says and the types of crashes and the scores it gets.
Driver assists are a big factor indeed.
On the other hand my old car had a lower NCAP score because the rated score for damage to pedestrians and cyclists if they were hit was about 50% worse. My old car wouldn't crumple too well. My new car would probably save the grandpa on his e-bike that I just ran over but my car would be fucked for the damage.
Side collisions on the rear, safety, is where you'll want to look. Because your child will be behind the passenger seat for most of its time in the car as its the safest place and sometimes mandated by law even. My car has screen/curtain airbags there that work in perfect tandem with my kid car seat, bumping the safety up to a 95% safety score compared to the 40% death trap score that my old 3 door had.
So all in all, the devil is in the details.

Personally the collision avoidance is one system I genuinely value for being there. As a parent you'll often be fucking tired the first years. It'll give you some false alarms here and there, probably. I've had it go off 5 times in the last year, and 2 were very real situations where traffic stopped way more sudden then I'd seen or anticipated (with sweet daughter girl crying in the back so yes I wasn't 100% focused.) I was glad because it absolutely minimised the very real chance that could have been an accident.",Dacia

"Logically incorrect - though you may feel whatever you want. 

4WD should not be about beauty but about using the 4WD. And the only purpose of having a raised car - ie a SUV - is 4WD.

Legislation should allow the very basic kind of 4WD that are so uncomfortable and clunky that only people who need 4WD would appreciate. This way there would be no more SUV/4WD on our roads in cities.

If you want a beautiful car for city/highway driving at a low ish price point then there are plenty of options … 

For beauty and lower price you do NOT need a SUV / 4WD

Note that I am using SUV and 4WD synonymous because practically speaking a SUV should actually always be 4WD’s (or at least AWD) because that’s the only reason for having less space at a higher clearance and fuel consumption.

"I've boungt a 2x4 petrol Dacia Duster Black Shadow from 2017. It had driven 120k km. I am from Scandinavia too. My fiance and I drove about 35k km in it so far over 1-2 years and here are my thoughts from what you are writing: 

1) Size and mini-camper. 

The size is perfect. We made a DIY foldable and flat-packable bed in the car with storage space. We went on a 10 days trip to france last summer and lived in the car. I can show you plans if you interested in this. We made it exetremely easy and easy to storage too. When we get kids we are planning to add a rooftop tent, so 2x can sleep in the car, and 2x can sleep in the tent.   
Also the size is great for just about anything. Milage is good. Fully packed on a ski-trip to the alps we drove between 16-17.5 km/l. On ""eco"" mode. 

To be honest I now wish we bought the same model, but as a 4x4. I would love the added stability and the possibility to climb different terrain when we travel. 

2) It is noisy. 

We got used to it. We can still hear a podcast on the road and have a good conversation. Though I know that this can be fixed. It requires some time and DIY solutions, but it is possible to it less noisy with a specific soundproofing material all over the car. 

3) If the wind is blowing, the car feels more alive - and you should be more focused when driving 110 km /h and up. 

4) Snow-driving. Last month we were doing a skitrip to Norway. It was extremely snowy and we have the all seasons tires. When we got into heavy snow we put on snowchains and we could drive easily uphill in 15-20 cm snow. 

5) Realiable.. Yes and no. It is reliable, but we had a red multifunction switch go on twice the past 6 months. We had it to a mechanic, who had a hard time diagnose it. Apparently this car has slightly sensitive sensors - which he said sometimes can give false alarms. Which is quite annoying. 

6) Safety. 

When i did my research, the reason it has a low score on safetytest was that it does not have the modern safety features. Like it doesnt brake by itself etc. The actual bulid itself went well in the crash-test. 

The way i see it; if you drive safely you're good. Accidents happen, but so many of todays cars will are so extremely modern - which makes me feel safer. If you need a better driving experience, where you feel the car will help ""driving"" - this is not the car for you.",Dacia

"Jogger is quite big for its engine 1L engine,unless you go for the hybrid engine. Its basically a longer (and heavier) Sandero Stepway.

The Duster is quite good with the right engine or configuration but its quite expensive.

The Stepway is the middle route, fully decked out its no more then 18-19k,but with the bi fuel engine keep in mind that you dont have a spare wheel and you have really small space in the trunk. For me its not a problem but for a family it may be a bit more difficult.",Dacia

"None of the current reviews are going to be objective. Being critical in a pre-production review would be a very quick ban from future reveals, and no ""journalist"" is going to risk that. They are all just rephraring the official introduction made directly by Dacia(even the car is the same, and on the same spot).

As for price, they want to keep the entry level trim below 20k, so I expect something like 19,990€. Given the current price differences between trims and engines, I assume the most common versions of new Duster will be at least 25-30k€.

NCAP... 3 stars would be success, but I have a feeling it's going to be 2 or 1. You cannot really reach higher without the non-mandatory driving assistants, and the crashes itself are going to be average at best.",Dacia

"Hard agree. While on vacation I had a current gen rental Renault Clio (so basically the same car as current Sandero) with SCe 65 engine and boy was it a struggle with four adults and luggage.

"The regeneration continues after engine is stopped. I made that point specifically. The mechanic at the dealer told me that the 10-15 minute fan going on after stopping the car is a sign it is finishing regen on DPF.

And if you read carefully I did try the Eco and didn’t get any significant advantage in consumption. My point was that for my stypw of drubing it doesn’t seem to make much sense.

"Maybe a carmaker that isn’t responsible for hazardous material recycling vs one that is (like it’s the case with tyres and batteries) can cost less, but when those external costs pile up the price goes up. China’s environment standards are low. When they sell the cars here they include the cost for what they’ll have to comply with into the cost of their product. 
Hazardous material decomposition/removal/recycling is one of the sensible regulations as it has great impact on the environment, whereas electric in relation to ICE is a smaller and less important CO2 saving move on part of the regulators that want to ban ICE. Modern ICE practically only save the immediate local environment, regarding the total co2 emissions  it isn’t as bad in relation to electric, when everything is taken into account (unless we make a lot more nuclear power plants).

Regarding the Spring - yes, my pount exactly! It is technically inferios car. While the samdero isn’t really. Sandero is just simpler but it us practically the same in functional terms as a car as its more expensive sibling Clio, same range and power - same engine, most pf the chassis features are the same… etc. 

It was exactly my point that in the past Dacia offered in essence “the same” but for less cost (on account of some arguably unimportant stuff being omitted).

Now with their EV they just offer less for less money. 

Everything you said about it was needed for functional and long lasting use (capacity, power, battery cooling for longevity), and for a hefty price for what this car functionaly is. It is less car for less money. Which dudn’t use to be so. That was what I was talking about.",Dacia

"Yes. I agree. The C3 is the better deal for the money. The only way Dacia can make this worthwhile is if they offer more features for the money.

Then potentially it’s an attractive option.",Dacia
"Depends what country you're in. Orders start in March in continental Europe, and later in the UK and Ireland, I think, but from order to delivery, that's going to be a long wait. The biggest change for the new Duster is the platform; something definitely worth waiting for. Duster 2 uses a platform from the late 90's. Duster 3's platform is modern. Although Duster 3 hasn't been crash tested yet, it will probably have better results than the Duster 2, but the overall stars will still be low due to not enough active safety electronics. The advantage of the Duster 2 is that it is tried, tested and refined as best as it can be. Any new model of car, when it comes out, might have some teething problems, but they should all be resolved under warranty. If I were you, I'd wait, maybe try to lease a car for a short period of time if you really need it, and then go for the Duster 3. Also, and that's subjective, the Duster 3 looks much better.",Dacia

Well I can’t really argue in any meaningful way than that the BEV tech can’t yet compete with ICE on price, which is what it’s all about. It will get there one day without government rushing it. BEV cars don’t really need lots of maintenance, what they need is swappable batteries and the batteries to make sense to replace coastwise. 

Today used BEVs like Zoe can be had for relatively affordable price. But I agree you can’t find them as cheap as an old ICE, however the cost of owning a car is much higher than the price of the car itself, especially with fuel. EU ducked up and electricity is now much more expensive than it needs to be, but if you charge at the right hours it’s still much cheaper than an ICE car, it’s also cheaper the more you drive. But people who drive less can generally also get a cheaper electric car with shorter range. If the Spring had 5 seats and it was 2 years old (like the Sandero I am now buying) it would make perfect economical sense for me to buy that one instead due to lower “fuel” cost and service costs, even though the purchasing price would likely be higher than the Sandero I now am getting.

If I remember correctly Tesla topped the chart and another brand showed practically no degradation, which the author soeculated must be due to some overprovisioning in the battery pack and smart management of that spare battery set tgat is not part of the usable capacity but rather gives the appearance (and effect) of less degradation of the whole pack. If I find it I will post it.

I also remember seeing tesla vs nisaan battery degeadation data where nissan’s pack deteriorated to 80% capacity and tela’s only 10 in a set period of time and similar use (charging, mileage) regimen. 

It also needs to be noted that efficiency of battery pack degrades with capacity degradation. You have a car that uses more energy (10-ish percent more) when you get to 70% capacity (if I remember the data correctly). That means range *further* drops on top of smaller capacity to hold energy. 

Another factor is that battery degradation isn’t linear. After beggining its use the capacity drops sharply, but then holds a fairly linear and predictable degradation drop downwards, until it starts to degrade sharply.

What all this means for the car market we can only guess. ICE cars engines can lice for decades with good maintenance. There are occasional costs involved but generaly and with a good mechanic they are bearable. Buying an old, used vehicle with what you can see and test drive and with little knowledge (or help of a mechanic you can take your car to examine it before buying) be sure hiw much it will cist you to repair this or that, negotiate price or if it’s a clean engine and mechanics - you’re good for a long time. Yes, there is a certain amount of cost involved with a used car, but it can be a cheap entry into private personal mobility world. 

Not so much so with the BEVs. Value retention will have to be *significantly* lower for buyers of new BEVs, and cars will be pretty much disposable. How will that reflect in the way they’ll make other parts of the cars when they know they’re disposable?

Consider electric grid too. To accomodate violently volatile high-power draws from the electric grid it will need massive investment - paid by society that will also have to in parallel invest into more sensible climate change coping and adapting technologies. A Tesla fast charger draws insane amount of power, a small manufactúre amount. And it does it unoredictably. This is a problem for stability of the grid as well as power distribution and production. 

Battery, unless some not-before-seen chemical tech emerges, isn’t the way to go, in my view. Hydrogen has its own problems and I don’t know much about it but EVs with electricity generation  devices like fuel cells at the momemt seem a better choice to focus on.

Again - I am not against BEVs. I think they are one of the alternatives and something that is wellcome to co-exist in the mobility mix. BEV - if I has chance to charge at home - would be an excellent alternative to our current Sandero, if the price was at least like Sandero’s. But BEVs shouldn’t be encouraged to be adopted on the financial burden of aociety that subvents those purchases, and much less BEVs should be the only thing allowed to be sold. I simply don’t find it sensible from a societal standpoint. And I didn’t even mention the price here, which is another factor that jas impact on society and has the power to change lives very tangibly for the worse for some segment of society.",Dacia
"The gearbox does whine a bit, especially in 2nd.",Dacia
Probably leftover from factory.,Dacia
"Nope, nothing on the seat and this was different than the seat belt alarm. Never heard anything like it. So unbelievably loud. Maybe I shouldn't have described it as a beep. It's like an alarm. Like a screeching fire alarm beep.",Dacia
"As I said, the turbo kicks in quickly and the accelerator is quite sensitive, hence ""jumpy"", I am not really sure how to describe it better, sorry.",Dacia
"Its turns the aircon on and off. If your not noticing a difference between in and off it might need regasing or checking its actually all working. 

Aircon on everything set to cold is the tell tail sign. Even in the height of summer it should feel like ice, like starts to hurt its that cold.",Dacia
"Labor plus the clutch too.  

If the trans is out and Im keeping it I'm not leaving in a clutch with 200k kilometers.",Dacia
2020 models were/are 30l.  Later models (not sure the year) were expanded to 50l.,Dacia
Upgrade the speakers maybe,Dacia
"Jogger or wait for new Duster that will be announced end of Nov. 

Current Gen II Duster is based on a very old platform (2002) and is essentially an improved version of Gen I rather than a new car. A lot of underpinning or decors (e.g. door handles) haven't changed since inception. Jogger, Sandero are based on a relatively new CMF-B platform also shared by other cars in Stellantis group.

Personally, I enjoy Jogger cockpit layout more, but objectively Duster has more features available (360 camera; USB sockets in the back). Second row of seats seems higher in Jogger which is good for kids but not necessarily for you. Jogger boot is not to be underestimated. It's big and has very practical dimensions. 

Seating, driving experience is similar for the engine options you consider.",Dacia
"Where I'm from, the wait time for my Sandero Stepway was almost exactly 6 months.",Dacia
Enjoy your Dacia! Take a chill pill maybe you will find your days less shitty.,Dacia
"Yeah I meant new Duster, changed it (can't change title), thanks!",Dacia
Seems like a snowflake response,Dacia
"1.2 TCe is a bad engine !

Renault was even sued for this, lost and had to retire it.

Check the internet about it - it will run on oil at some point and there is no fix for it !",Dacia
Blind spot detection in rain/snow is a common challenge in all cars. Just assume it won't work correctly in those circumstances.,Dacia
