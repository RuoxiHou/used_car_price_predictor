No mods planned. I think it's perfect just the way it is,Maserati
Wow!!,Maserati
Thanks a lot,Maserati
Still have to buy the expensive parts.,Maserati
"No don’t do it man I have a 2013 and I thought ok I’ll fix and maintain in the driveway. Went well for two years until I broke the ZF. 10,000$ repair almost. Do you want to spend half your salary to repair it? I’m sure you can do half the price if you look for a scrapper with a used box not rebuild. Passed about 3 months wondering what to do with it. I don’t know how advanced your shops are in Poland but I don’t want purko from Bulgaria rebuilding my transmission. First save a lot for repairs then don’t touch it then buy.",Maserati
"If you're actually concerned about resale, then you shouldn't be buying any of these cars",Maserati
buy a second one so you have one to drive while the other is in the shop for maintenance or repair.,Maserati
"ZF cars cannot be manual swapped.  The transaxle was reengineered for the new transmission and the ZF is a traditional torque converter.

If you’re US based and it is a 2011 Sport GT S I might be interested.",Maserati
My 2011 Grancabrio has the ZF auto and yes you can manually switch gears via the gearstick and via paddles,Maserati
Gotta love melting interiors. Going to start fixing mine soon. Every surface is sticky/melted.,Maserati
I remember those turds.,Maserati
"Perception is in part reality. 

The market says it is inferior. Therefore demand is lower and resale is worse. 

Depreciation hurts the brand and the financial health of the company.

Losing money isn’t something wealthy people just enjoy and losing money isn’t a luxury.",Maserati
"Great vehicle.  Rotates in corners almost like a sports car.  I almost bought one.  However, it’s missing a number of features for its price point.  No ventilated seat option, upgraded sound systems isn’t very good (poor subwoofer), slow infotainment computer and wheel gap too big.  It also had a weird drone at certain RPM’s. I could have fixed the wheel gap and subwoofer weakness for about $5k, but lowering would have killed the suspension warranty.   Still I love the way it drives.",Maserati
"No, we bought it from a Mercedes dealership actually. It was a one owner car that traded it for a high end AMG SUV Mercedes.

Fortunately for us, I'm a BMW tech by trade, so I'm able to do all the maintenance myself. I only use OEM Maserati/Ferrari oil filters, and the recommended oil. The filters are about $50 each, and it's about $100 in oil. I change it every 5k miles.

You'd have to check with your local dealer, but I would guess typically in the $400-600 range for an oil service. That's what I've heard.

Getting a certified car from a Maserati dealer is a great idea and will give you a little piece of mind with a warranty. Cayennes are good cars, but maintenance won't be much less. Porsche dealers aren't cheap either.",Maserati
Looks good from here!,Maserati
"Interesting suggestion. 

Comparable in feel to the Quattroporte?",Maserati
Make sure you have your foot firmly on the brake and that it is in park?,Maserati
I think you’ll find that it’s a Maserati you’re in and this is the average experience of owning one,Maserati
I meant brake pads.,Maserati
My Maserati does 185 ♫,Maserati
You can get a decently priced Corvette too for that price. A c5/c6 and they would still their value. 💀 And would be cheaper to maintain along with the mustang.,Maserati
Maserati doing maserati things.,Maserati
Can't be worse than a Gremlin...  🤔,Maserati
Does anyone know what a clutch costs on these today?,Maserati
"Shit, now that's unfortunate. Saw an used engine on eBay for $5k the other day, seemed cheaper than the LS3 in my Camaro.",Maserati
First time for everything,Maserati
"Yes I know the rear splitter you are after, it’s a nicer design but more expensive. This company stocks them and is well regarded…

"Almost a quarter mil for a GT is insanity given the rapid depreciation that plagues the brand. I also don’t really think it’s reasonable to compare this to a Ferrari, Bentley, or Aston - Maserati wishes it was in the same ballpark, but it’s just not there.",Maserati
Just bc you can’t afford it doesn’t make it a pos car.,Maserati
Your Rolex don't even look right tbh,Maserati
Don’t be a fool. Get the Porsche Macan. They are built like tanks and they look great. Maserati is trouble.,Maserati
You pick the one that suits your personality,Maserati
Reset or pull the negative post off the battery. Mine did the same thing. Usually at a valet station.,Maserati
"It's a 2024, but I do get your point. Thanks for the advice",Maserati
"I've put coilovers on my 2013 QP S.  There is a definite difference you can feel.  My coilovers  are definitely firmer, and that is now all the time.  Also, it went a little lower than I expected.  So now I scrape the bottom every now and then.  
Personally, I don't mind too much any of these new quirks, as I like to drive hard and fast.  
As far as handling, it is like its on rails!  I do sometimes miss the more refined ride of the OEM shocks (which I still have btw).  The original shocks are sublime when they work.",Maserati
Sht!!! And I just missed out on a 2018 Ghibli 4s for 25k with 29k miles. FKKKK,Maserati
"Zero clue, but it looks stunning. Maserati as well",Maserati
"OEM brakes is more like $2500-3000 for front/rear pads/rotors. $50 Ferrari factory oil filter that you need to seriously torque down or it’ll pop off. 

Tires cost $$$. Alignments sucks to do on the GT/QP. 

There’s random Evap Diagnostic pumps that go bad, gas caps, etc. don’t remember pricing on that stuff.",Maserati
"I don’t mind not being the fastest on the road, but I’d like to be able to back up the looks by being pretty quick. From your experience the Alfa had more luxury inside?",Maserati
Love the AR saloons. Quad 505 hp stock for under 100k and lower is sweet,Maserati
How is their reliability?,Maserati
Correct. They were both on this morning. Then both were off by the evening. I'm wondering if they broke off? Or someone stole them?,Maserati
I’m hate-shopping a Chrysler (Pacifica) right now and your comment is so triggering.,Maserati
"From low revs to high revs, the maserati ferrari crossplane v8 engines sound soo good",Maserati
"Negotiable...hoping to find someone who knows what it is. Still needs some additional odds and ends done, so not trying to be top of market.",Maserati
"In your opinion, what's roughly the threshold for driving it enough to stave off problems? Is 45 min/roundtrip 1-2x a week enough? I'm considering one of these, but WFH and have heard this comment enough times to wonder if I drive enough for it to not be a pain in the ass.",Maserati

"I would definitely agree with getting the car inspected. The 2014 was the first model year. Check for spring sag on the front suspension as that was a common issue. If it doesn't have the bowers and wilkins stereo, be prepared for awful audio. The sound system wasn't good. Make sure that it was serviced and maintained meticulously. The 14s and 15s have had some issues with oil pump failure, which led to seized engines. Get the car looked over throughly and get some sort of warranty if you can. Best of luck. I hope everything goes well.",Maserati
That’s something I need to tackle myself one day. I like how the steamers clean the engine bays. I need to get one myself,Maserati
Depends on the area and try to park in busy streets or parking garages,Maserati
"I had an older GT, bought an '18 for the upgraded interior only to realize the infotainment system is silo'd from the rest of the car. Yes, you get a larger higher res touch screen, but it was a compliance mod to incorporate the required rear view camera. Went back to a '16 with no regrets.",Maserati
Ive heard the front doors combined with the seat position make it a bitch to get in to if you are tall.,Maserati
Beautiful car.,Maserati
Chrystler sucks get rid of it,Maserati
"Expensive. Expect to spend around $1,500 for that repair.",Maserati
You can’t take that to Jiffy Lube,Maserati
"I would sell it and get rid of it. You have a 14, which is known for issues. Never buy the first model year of anything. If you're going to do it, make sure it's under warranty. I have a Ghibli, and once the warranty is up, I will get rid of it and get another one to avoid potentially being the situation you're in. Best of luck.",Maserati
I have a Ghibli at 27K miles on the clock. Not a single problem so far.,Maserati
New or used?,Maserati
"I bought new and have 45K miles on a '13. Other than the weep and leak, it's been totally fine. We do have a lift, which does make things much easier.

However, I do have a lifetime of Italian car ownership and an RS4 as well, so my perceptions of ""just fine"" might be somewhat skewed. ;)",Maserati
Maserati paid reddit.,Maserati
If only the 4200 or Gran Sport had those lights.,Maserati
Sorry buddy didn’t realize I wasn’t allowed to,Maserati
a Honda HR-V with Maserati badges is crazy,Maserati
They break easily. Sure it’s just missing. Should be covered by warranty.,Maserati
"Sure, but also population density means businesses competition so supply/demand cuts both ways in LA. 

If you live in a smaller town in the midwest, it’s not uncommon for an independent shop to see a Maser and not want to work on it. To them it presents a new/super uncommon, expensive vehicle they don’t want to be responsible for breaking. It’s not a matter of if they *can*. It’s a matter of if they’re *willing* to.

Agree again on that.",Maserati
"Just perfection...most beautiful car ever, in my opinion.",Maserati
Levante it is then😂,Maserati
"What is a “fierce creation is the nocturnal world?” 

That’s taking marketing speak to a whole new level.",Maserati
"No we didn’t.

We went from one to two so quickly after that point that the car just didn’t work at all anymore for us. With two, it just didn’t work.",Maserati
"I can't.  I got it as a black Friday deal.  Here is an image though.  I think I paid $50 US for it.  I've been pleased for the price.

"Hey thanks for the reply! Definitely looking at the ZF cars. I’ve always had 100k miles plus Audi/vw that I’ve bought cheap and rebuilt. Looking for something newer and more reliable. Looking at a 2008-2013 GT with <30k miles. I’ve looked at c300 and BMW but the complicated turbo, AWD, GDI, 8 speed auto, etc make me a hell of a lot more nervous than a V8 ZF. I also can’t stomach an American car. It can’t be worse than my mk1 AWD 225 TT right? Lol",Maserati
I love it. It’s very beautiful. You can always play the game of is this the color I’m happiest with but bottom line is that is a very beautiful car,Maserati

What’s your favorite part about this Ghibli? Thinking of grabbing a used one,Maserati
Think it's coming back around. And I thoroughly enjoy mine...!,Maserati
"I hear you.  In my experience at least, it’s not the parts that you can find after market that get you, it’s the ones you have to order OEM.  One of your headlight or tail light bulbs goes out and you have to replace the entire housing, which has to be OEM.  Instances where you can use after market like the brakes,  the kind that you need is a bit more expensive than your standard break pads.  It’s these random things that inevitably go out that really hit the wallet and at 75k miles is past the point when things first start going out.  I’m at barely 40k and I’ve had things go out already.",Maserati
"To answer your question, they depreciate in something of an ouroboros cycle. They’re not unreliable, but things do break at higher than the average rate. When a mechanic sees one pull into the shop, they up-charge significantly for maintenance. That leads to cars getting totaled at a higher rate, and that jacks up insurance rates (you should get a quote), and that all drives down the price of used models. Then someone buys them and doesn’t do maintenance when they see the cost, so they break down more, and the cycle goes on.

They aren’t horrible on reliability, *but* every kind of maintenance or repair will be significantly more expensive than you may be used to for a Camaro. 4-6x (very) roughly. You’d be paying maintenance on a $140k car after all. If you can’t comfortably afford that, it will be a death trap for your finances. 

Simple oil changes go into the multiple hundreds of dollars, and it’s not uncommon to see brakes in the multiple thousands (depending on where you live).  

The interior on pre-2018 models are… not good. You should look up some interior pics, and note that the dial buttons (yes, dial buttons) are infamous for being sticky because the plastic degrades over time.

Now, can these be worth it? Absolutely. The engine’s roar alone will put a smile on your face every time you drive it. But you need to go in wide-eyed to the pitfalls and really consider if it’s worth the longer term costs.

Edit: “fave” -> “face”",Maserati
"Yes, there’s rear climate control in the car. Will check the relative placement of the rear fans but yes that might be the reason for missing storage. Thanks",Maserati
Congrats. And how is the sports aspect of driving?,Maserati
Jinx,Maserati
Yep. That's exactly what that is. About an 1987 or thereabouts. Maserati made them from 81 to 94. People have said it was the worst car ever made.,Maserati
We have two of them. Had them for a while.,Maserati
It depends.  First question is GTs or MC.,Maserati
"Formula Dynamics is active on Maserati Life and has a very good reputation there. My car has not needed anything yet, but the two I see recommended the most are Scuderia and Formula Dynamics: https://formuladynamics.com/",Maserati
"Personally, I went with the coupe. I think it looks better as a car; the lines don't get broken up by the roof. And honestly, the car looks weird (imo) with the top down. 

Plus, I'm not a fan of convertibles. Just extra things to break and maintain.",Maserati
"Awesome, thank you. I'll check the plans (to avoid any, ohh didn't I tell you...?,from the wife) and will let you know mid-week or so.",Maserati
"First time I have heard putting loctite on the teeth, but I can confirm those retention washers do wear and rattle with age. 

Curious what Loctite model you recommend and if it may cause unintended effects with the oil, heat, and torque.",Maserati
"It has a European flair.. so, ciao baby!",Maserati
"Had the same issue, the dealership fixed it for free when I did maintenance.",Maserati
They're not comparable.  I've driven both and would go with the Supra simply because it is a much more modern car.  Especially if you need something reliable.,Maserati
"Honestly, if it’s a Sport GT S, I wouldn’t mess with it too much, those cars sound fantastic from the factory. 

If it isn’t a Sport GT S, try and find said vehicle’s exhaust and retrofit it in. Or Tubi, they wake up the non GT S cars quite a bit.",Maserati
Which one would you prefer?,Maserati
What you getting after the lease is over?,Maserati
Quasimodo predicted this,Maserati
"Haven't watched it yet, but Doug is weirdly biased against Maserati. Hopefully he likes this one.",Maserati
If you want a ghibli or quattroporte get a 2018+ model,Maserati
"2014 is a great year, low mileage ones typically have more issues like leaky head gaskets, not a hard repair if you are mechanically inclined. But it scares off most owners since they don’t want to foot the bill at the dealer. 

Basic maintenance is really not any harder than a f150.",Maserati
"My 18 Levante has one, it’s right above the license plate. Either yours is broken, missing, or they’re lying to you.",Maserati
"would be the 8th year since owning this but couldn't drive it for 3 years from covid travel bans. Just recently decided to pick it back up and a lot of it has fallen apart from not driving it, battery, alternator, tyres, interiors, center dash screens, and fuel pump were all gone. Just broke 4000km millage this year hope this current setup won't cost me too much to run.",Maserati
"Im shocked you got a levante 2020 with no cameras, it must be defective, and the dealer removed it. In 2020, levantes had cameras it’s insane to not have a camera in a Maserati for a 2020 model. You should look into it. But it’s not normal.",Maserati
"I had a 2006 Quattroporte and a 2006 Grand Sport LE for many years so, yeah, I feel you 😀",Maserati
"Yup, both the GT and the Giulia are mine.  Don't underestimate the Giulia either.  They drive like a go cart and are easily modded into the 325 HP range.",Maserati
"So, tow it to a mechanic?",Maserati
"Easy. 

If you’re a normal human being, go for the Lexus. Really well built, really nice car. 

If you’re a petrol head go Jag. It’s the best all rounder. Especially the F-Type R. All the stereotypes you’ve heard of Jaaaaaaag owners are true. 

If you’re heart is set on owning a Ferrari one day, go Maserati. It’s the stepping stone and gateway drug. If you don’t like it, you don’t buy a Ferrari. Simple as that. 

Alfa?  A fine alternative if you’re looking for something between the Jag and the Maserati.",Maserati
I know Chili’s get a lot of hate but I think they are a great performance value,Maserati
"Seriously?  A Maserati costing less then a Jag?  Colour me amazed. 

I’ve owned both (on the Jag right now) — the Quattroporte cost me a fortune…money well spent as far as I’m concerned but I’m amazed. How did the Jag let you down?",Maserati
"Lol I did. The VVT started making noise the first month. I fixed it myself. 

I love that car.",Maserati
"I might have the unpopular opinion here but I say it’s totally worth it to invest in the higher tier if you plan on keeping your Grecale for 10 years.

The Grecale is loaded with technology and it’s the first year on the market, so there’s a ton that could go wrong that you don’t know about yet. Maserati repairs are NOT cheap. I speak from experience, the last thing you want is to spend more money than the car’s value in a few years. Even when financially stable, you don’t want to have a bad investment.",Maserati
There are probably people way more knowledgeable than me on here but if I remember correctly the last year for the 4.7 was 19 and the tech upgrade happened in 17.  Probably anything 12 or newer with the spec and maintenance you want is okay.  Just so many different options.  I wasn't sold on mine till the test drive was almost over and it downshifted under an overpass.  I giggled like I was 5 and promptly signed the paperwork.  It sounds that good.,Maserati
"Buy a brand new motorcycle for that, if you’re lookin for a babe mobile lol",Maserati
I'm pretty sure this is 2022 or newer Honda HR-V with a few Maserati styling cues and badges.,Maserati
"I definitely have, as well as others. Usually when I do research cars I find a ton of issues. Valve body’s, carbon issues on gdi cars, crazy module electronic issues, turbo shaft seal leaks, etc. couldn’t find anything on the GT but that it was bullet proof besides the VVT issues on pre2011 cars and the F1 trans issues, so I’m reach out as far as I can.",Maserati
"Yea the recommendations are kind of silly, we turned our guys around when they were two and put them into a convertible car seat/booster. My oldest is 5 now and uses it as a booster with the seat belt.",Maserati
"My wife's Hyundai has massaging seats, not to be a dick but, buy a Hyundai. Honestly I like the fact that my 14 GT lacks a lot of high end gadgets like that. All those things break, and I can't even figure out how to scroll through my XM radio favorites, the last thing the car needs is more ""Italian logic"" driven electronics.  


Just my opinion of course, but I think my car has just the right amount of doo dads. Cruise, parking sensors and a few other things. The only thing I would add (and will add) is a back up camera).",Maserati
"If you take that in for service to clean it up, it’ll cost you $10 grand.",Maserati
"This is where having a reputable ferrari, alfa, maserati independent comes in. Have them inspect and certify the quality. The days of China quality being automatically subquality are over, you can find the best of the best if you know where to look.

"Its a long and complicated story but ill try to make it short and plausable. I went into the electrical field right after school together with my Father and younger Brother we built a buisiness and worked our asses off basicly not ever having a day off in about 7 Years. That partiall having to do with my Mother beeing sick. But after she unfortunatly passed away we saved some money and thought it would be a great homage to her and small reward for our efforts. She mentioned to me that she loved the maserati Quattroporte from the intouchables. And as soon as we saw it we wanted one really badly also the gts is (or was) quite cheap for what i think it should be worth.

So yeah, no bullshit just Hard work and fortunately Family.

Also we have two. One wich we wanted to sell later as a bit of an investment. A even more beutiful low millage all black Gts Awards Edition. But sadly we fell in love With both and that is no longer going to happen xD",Maserati

"I’m not trying to be confrontational or anything but I’m just asking out of curiosity, do you personally feel like a GranTurismo or an MC20 is any less of a car because of the depreciation? For me I’d rather own a GranTurismo for $50,000 versus window-shopping and dreaming about having a $150,000+ Ferrari someday. I feel like what’s best for me as the consumer might not always be what’s best for the manufacturer.",Maserati
"Many thanks, she is going to go for it.  Amazing that a $130k car from 2021 now is $48k with less than 20k miles.  Clean carfax and looks/sounds amazing.  Thanks for the sanity check!",Maserati

"It's been an issue since the car was brand new but my stupid as been traveling and thought about sending back to dealer when I'm back and when I'm free but it's been so long after warranty expired I don't know what to do.

Basically the fan will always blow at the windscreen creating condensation no matter what mode I put the fan mode into, the only way to stop it from doing it is to not have fan at all which is not viable as I'm in a hot climate country.

has anyone else experienced this?",Maserati
"* weight is said to be 3757 pounds vs the 3307 advertised; this was weighed by caranddriver- I can imagine the cielo will be heavier. 
* I'll admit its a nice looking car- I was tempted to get one as well. But from friends who own much nicer cars (lambos, porsches, ferarris) they've all said it's a tad boring and lacks ""emotion""; personally I'd take a 911 GT3 any day vs any of those cars.
* No idea on the Mc20 - but most of the Maserati line gets hit pretty hard from what I've seen. My levante has probably lost a good chunk and it's not even a year old. 

Good luck- Test drive the cielo at the showroom; it'll answer your question. Everyone's got their own opinion on what a good drive is... also the price of mc20; i'd go lambo/porsche any day. At least where I am at they are priced to those ranges; nothing sounds better than the v10 or the porsche sound.",Maserati

"I have a GTs and a Giulia Ti Q4 sport.  I just got the GTs out of the garage from the winter and have been driving it the past couple weeks.  I went with my daughter in the Alfa on an errand and felt like a peasant.  The Alfa Quadrifoglio will outperform them all, but the GTs or the GT MC are just different.  Make sure and get the 4.7 and no F1 gearbox.",Maserati

"You definitely should so rotors every time your pads wear out on this generation of Maserati, we get a lot of complaints of brake noise or juddering after people try to do pads only.",Maserati

Buy the parts yourself and find a mechanic that charges by the hour. $1500 for a control arm.... Lol,Maserati
"I’m biased because I have a Jag. But they are very special cars. 

In interests of fairness, they’re all amazing — you may just want to test drive all of them and see which you bond with the fastest. 

And naturally, the one with the best service history if you’re going used is always smart. A thumbs up from an independent and trusted mechanic is also valuable.",Maserati
That was true 30 years ago,Maserati
"The SQ4 will give you all wheel drive and more horsepower. The base model will be slower and underpowered so they won't feel the same. 

In terms of purchasing one, I would recommend an 18 and up. The ghibli had finally matured and became refined for 2018 and newer. I would recommend a cpo with a warranty in the event that something does fail. These cars can be expensive. Running costs are also high as well but not too terrible. 

To summarize, I have a 15 SQ4, and I recently spent about 2 weeks with an 18 SQ4 while I was getting work done under warranty, and here is how I would describe them. My 15 SQ4 feels like an incomplete project car that was built in someone's backyard, while the 18 felt like a car built by a large manufacturer on a large assembly line. It was much more sorted. 

I do love my 15 SQ4, and while the 18s and up are better in every way, the 14, 15, and 16s sound way better than the 18s and up could ever hope to sound. Best of luck in your search. Hopefully, I gave you some clarity.",Maserati
You got one?,Maserati
"It’s prolly a replica / custom bro, both bumper & headlamps. It’s pretty common in Asia 🤣",Maserati
"Thanks, yes I wanted to keep mine stock but felt the kit and the spacers I’ve also added just enhanced the look slightly rather than over powered it. I don’t think I’ll add anything else now, such as a rear lip spoiler that a lot do. I think she’s just right. 

The kit can be easily removed if you ever change your mind by the way.",Maserati
Maserati’s least favorite feature.,Maserati
"I change the oil ever 5k miles. It's $100 in oil, and $50 for a genuine filter. I'm doing it myself, so no labor cost. I'm a BMW master tech, so I have a shop and a lift. Air filters are $50 each and there's two. Changed those once, but probably time again. Cabin filter is $50. It hasn't needed brakes. Been through one set of tires. Michelin or pirelli is about $2k for a set. I did my own alignment.

Labor cost is where it's going to hurt a little. Dealerships are pricey for sure, but in my opinion it's worth it to have someone that specializes in the brand and knows what they're doing. I would only use OEM parts.",Maserati
Do you mind me asking what region you are basing your pricing on,Maserati
"Looks beautiful. These Maseratis are getting more angular and aggressive and I, for one, don't mind it. Congratulations! Hope you enjoy it (don't forget to constantly drive it in sport/manual 😉).",Maserati
"If you want burbles you need to replace the Cats with downpipes. That alone will probably give you some burbles on downshifts, the next step would be to contact Formula Dynamics and get their ECU module.

I had these on my 2014 Granturismo and it sounded amazing with plenty of burble but wasn’t obnoxious. 

Flame tune is a whole other deal and you probably won’t find anyone willing and able to do this on your QP.",Maserati

Sounds like this is your first experience.. if you need brakes for example you are looking at around $1700 for fronts and $1300 for rears. About $1000 for stock tires. If a sensor or anything is acting up, 700-2000… etc.. also be ready for a headlight to go and that’s gonna run you about $2000 for the pair.",Maserati
"Lexus is going to cost you more upfront, probably less long-term. But $50k is a bit tight for an LC500, an IS F maybe? But that one looks quite dull imho.   
You gotta (also) decide, do you want a v8? If you do, a Granturismo will be perfect for you. It also has usable rear seats. But it's not that fast, not by modern standards anyway.   
F-Type v8 will run circles around it, even the v6 at Stage 2. But the GT will sound better, much better.   
If you don't mind the car being a bit older, you could also consider an XKR. The 4.2 is somewhat more reliable than the 5.0.  
If you're content with 6 cylinders, the Giulia QV is gonna be pretty much faster than all the rest, albeit 50k is again a bit tight for a low mileage model, and you don't want a high mileage one :D  
You could also look into DB9s, RS5-s (na v8 revving to 8500 or supercharged 6 easily tuned to roughly match the Giulia), and Audis have actually got great interiors.   
I was also looking into G29 Z4s recently. B58 is reliable, almost 500 hp at Stage 2, and I find it to be the best looking modern BMW.  
Too many options, I'm afraid :D :D But tell me more about your preferences and we could try narrowing it down.",Maserati
I’d be surprised if it’s under $2400 to replace tbh,Maserati
Happened on my work van. It was a tiny hose that got disconnected. Maybe its that,Maserati
Trade it in on a certified 18 or newer. Or buy a motor from a newer wreck and have it swapped,Maserati

"*Quadrifoglio. Better in most ways than the Levante. A much better driver's car. Also, after 7 months ownership I don't think you can claim it's reliable. If I had any issues with any car at 7 months, I'd be pissed! Buy the Stelvio though, you won't regret it!",Maserati

thats ow I bought mine. only 8000 miles on a 10 year old car. i put 75 miles on it for 2 years and when  a lady hit me in rear end I got back what i used as a down and bought a tacoma. I miss my gran turismo but operating costs zre high for sure.,Maserati
"I don’t mean in the hood, I mean not everyone has access to an independent shop that can work on a Maser in their area. LA is a terrible example because it’s such a car and wealth hub you can get anything done there. 

Buying your own parts is always cheaper, that I’ll agree with.",Maserati
You should try the Levante.   Best car I’ve ever had.  Great for road trips.,Maserati
"People buy a GranTurismo because it’s a great car at a great price not realising they are called to maintain a car that not only was made by Ferrari but at very low volume as well.  If one can’t afford to replace the brakes of an F430, they won’t afford to replace the brakes of the GranTurismo.  Come first service under their ownership they realise what kind of car this is and they sell it.",Maserati
😭😭😭,Maserati
"Just be prepared it may be hard to sell. My 2017 Ghibli S Q4 was for sale for quite a while before it actually sold. And, I took less than I wanted to get. Obviously, there’s a lot of factors. But once you’re ready to sell, it may still take a while!",Maserati

Congratulations and merry merry!!!,Maserati
Happy to hear. My last 2 cars were Maserati’s. I got service cost fatigue with the second one and finally gave up on Maserati. It was a fun run while it lasted.,Maserati
"Maserati has come so far on quality, luxury and performance in the past 3-4 years.  All these models are expensive to maintain especially if you are saying this is a daily driver.  For comfort and performance, that Maserati sound cannot be beat.  I smile every time I hit the gas. Make sure the previous owner maintained it and have fun driving no matter what unit you select.",Maserati
This right here. An entire industry sprang up over Ferrari's insistence on using this crap.,Maserati
"I drive mine almost exclusively in sport and manual. But I shift like I'm in ICE mode. My understanding is that sport shifts later (higher revs) than normal and has exhaust open, whereas ICE shifts earlier (lower revs) than normal. I don't see much difference in mpg between the modes when I drive like this, so I benefit from the sound of sport mode, but the economy of ICE mode. 

Alternatively you can pull and plug the vacuum hoses on the exhaust, but I like to retain the option of making it quieter on long drives.",Maserati
"Yes this is it, finally found the car that I'm going to finance for 144 months!",Maserati

Are you in the Maserati sub telling people not to buy any of them?,Maserati
"Rolls Royce has been outsourcing the engine in their vehicles to BMW for the last twenty years but nobody dares say a negative word about a Rolls Royce. Mercedes Benz makes all the motors for Aston Martin. A Lamborghini engine is made by Volkswagen. Toyota brought back the iconic Supra….which is an almost near-identical clone to a BMW Z4. But who would dare badmouth Toyota right? Toyota has all the R&D money in the world to make everything for the Supra but instead they just took the lazy/less expensive route and basically took a BMW Z4 and changed the body panels and gave us the “revolutionary” new Supra. The problem is that Maserati has no economy of scale. Their orders from auto part manufacturers are in the hundreds where Toyota and Honda order parts in the tens of thousands and because of their order size they get preferred pricing. Also, Maserati doesn’t have an unlimited R&D budget like Honda, Toyota, Hyundai etc have so they can’t make everything in house but Rolls Royce suffers from the same problem but everyone loves that brand. What your mechanic really means is “I’m not comfortable working on a Maserati because I don’t have a bidirectional diagnostic tablet that includes a Maserati/Ferrari software module and I also don’t want the liability of having to pay Maserati prices to fix parts that I mess up during the course of repairing a Maserati.” So he tells you not to buy a Maserati because if you do then he’ll lose a loyal customer. I own a Quattroporte and I haven’t had any trouble getting parts for my car. I’ve even emailed the dealership with a photo of me pointing to a part and then they email me the exploded view of a part list and the part number I need along with the corresponding price. With all that being said, if your wife isn’t prepared for sticker shock when something goes bad then she definitely shouldn’t buy a Maserati. I recently bought one window regulator and it was like $350. A new water seal (which is literally just a flimsy piece of foam that sits behind the door card) was over $100. I asked for lug nuts and I shit you not the dealership quoted me $40/lug nut which made me laugh and I just bought them somewhere else for $4 each. I don’t regret buying my car for even one second but you have to remember that a Maserati depreciates but the cost of replacement parts never depreciates. You’re still replacing parts as if the car is worth $120,000 even if it’s worth $40,000.",Maserati
That happened to my mom and I as well with the app. We bought our cars 2 weeks ago. We called and they said it was a glitch. Hope this helps!,Maserati

"Have you tried remote starting it? My Ghibli has done this before, and I took it to the dealer where they found no fault codes or anything. They believed that it could potentially be the CAN system not communicating with the key fob properly. 

Also, make sure that you're pressing the brake pedal hard as they said it could be the brake switch starting to fail and when that happens, the car doesn't know that your foot is on the brake pedal.",Maserati

That’s not what you buy to get you by. Also that’s the absolutely bottom tier un optioned POS. What is your plan when the headlight burns out? AC compressor goes? Etc etc? You will spend more than the cost of the car to keep it running and that’s part of the reason it’s being given away.,Maserati

"You might want to look for Facebook groups of owners of these cars, you’ll get more feedback than here. 
My point of view though, as an older Maserati owner: you need to partner up with well established and recognized mechanics & specialists of the brand. Not many Maserati and Ferrari owners would buy a modified clutch kit from some unknown guy online without some serious references.
As for your question, if the product lives up to its promises and is reasonably priced, I’m sure there is a market for it. Original parts are expensive and hard to find.",Maserati
Because it IS,Maserati
"Yeah that’s a good point. I don’t know what the future holds for Maserati but I think they’ve always intended on being a limited production specialty brand. It’s weird how Maserati cars specifically depreciate so hard compared to its competition. I’ve owned two Quattroportes and my friend has a GranTurismo and I’ve had zero mechanical issues with them and his GT has given him zero problems. Also, that ZF 6 speed and then 8-speed auto transmission is bulletproof.",Maserati

"Frankly, with a Ghibli specifically for me, based on all the stuff I read, it's the most reliable of the models. There are parts everywhere for this car because for some reason people keep wrecking them. This one is an SQ4 But I'd like the interior. I like the speed It has, some of the options that mine has makes it a bit more of a comfortable drive. It's just a neat car. I've loved them for years and always wanted one and I'm to the point in my life where I can fix a lot of things on this car but if not I can afford to take it somewhere.",Maserati

I kind of like the huge depreciation hit. To me I am thinking:

In 18 months it is possible to pick a spyder up that's a crazy 350k sticker with 15k miles for 150k? That's a decently spec'd 992 s used.

I think I am leaning towards a used 812. The combination is hard to beat. I intend to put 100k miles on it.

I think the only thing I will miss is having a sunroof or spyder. I will simply not pay 80% more for a sunroof/convertible.

That said I’m a huge fan of highly depreciated cars. I simply don’t buy anything that’s not already depreciated heavily and I have four cars that are probably the best known for it. All four gets were over 100k new each and I bought them all for less than a new base 911.",Maserati
Fastest depreciating cars in the world,Maserati
Thanks for the info!,Maserati
">prior year ones that now cost $30K.

He's talking about used models being so cheap on the aftermarket. That in a way is one of Maserati's biggest competitors, their own used cars. Since they don't hold their value that well $200K and up is a really hard sell for a car that can be had lightly used for a fraction of that. Add to that the old Ferrari V8 was the Italian version of an LS motor, proven a million times over and very well known and reliable. People including me don't have that same feeling about the twin turbo V6.

i work on these cars if you plan on having one for the AWD be sure to keep aside 6k because the transfercase WILL leak and Maserati does not sell/have the seals so u need 5k for the case and 1k for the labor. and the oil cooler housing will leak so will turbos if u drive like an animal,Maserati

"Last year I took my wife's ""16 Honda Pilot for an oil change, check engine light, tire rotation.  Oil change 80 bucks.  The service writer said I need a complete brake job ($350) and I needed to replace the ""compliance arms"" ($1400), and they wanted 80 bucks to rotate the tires.  I am a machinist and a former helicopter mechanic and I usually do all of my work. And since it's her car, I do what she says.  Anyway, I replaced the front pads, 60 bucks, checked the compliance arms (they were perfect), the rear disk and rotors were good for another year.   4 months ago, I had an A1 service code so back to the dealership.  The technician said I needed complete brake job, replace compliance arms and oil change, replace 4 oxygen sensors, and 80 bucks to rotate the tires for a total of $3600.  The control arms are perfect, I rotated the tires, replaced the rear pads ($60) and bought a very good OBDII tester and engine code diagnostic meter.  The 4 oxygen sensors are good.

My point:  Don't get upset with high Maserati maintenance costs, my wife's Honda would have cost $1400 for the control arms plus the un-needed brake jobs. 

Keep your Maserati well-maintained and do the work yourself, if you have the ability.  And be sure the Cheap and Quick discount oil change service uses the proper filter and knows how to replace the drain plug or you will be paying for a new engine.",Maserati

You get the exterior updates, the newer seats, and they don't have the variator issues of the earlier models. I put my budget at 40-50k. Don't worry about the deal. Just find a good one.

"I had a 17 Giulia Ti Sport prior to my first Levante. And I loved it. Double black and those gorgeous wheels. The sport package is the biggest bang for your buck step-up in cars (in my opinion). It drove great and had a crispness of steering that blew the doors off the Audi it replaced (which was good in its own right).

I can’t speak to the income side of things, but I will say that our recent decision was between a new Stelvio Veloce/Estrema vs a 3 year old pre-owned Levante. They sticker at roughly the same spot.

Pre-owned Maseratis seem to only fall in 2 camps: garaged beauties and drug-lord bumper cars. I would only buy a Maserati that I could see in person and that was certified. That way I’m getting a vehicle that was originally twice the price of the Stelvio with a multi-year warranty.

As for reliability, both the Alfa and the Maserati have been completely error-free. The Alfa had a couple of infotainment restarts. I did go back later and add an awesome CarPlay/Android Auto platform from ENG-Custom in Italy since the 17 didn’t have it.

Depreciation is a good thing in my book. People like AZWolf go out and give us the privilege of hearing the symphony that is the Ferrari F136 engine. Meanwhile Ferrari owners pay five times more for their cars and then lock them up in a garage and rarely drive them and just end up rubbing them with a lint-free cloth their whole lives because they’re worried about putting miles on the car and what it’s resale value will be. It’s sad.,Maserati

"That's what I figured, and they may be fine, or not. Quality control on cheap goods is laughably bad. I bought a cheap brake tool because I knew I wouldn't use it much, I actually bent the metal of the tool just using with my bare hands. It would be funny if it weren't so stupid.

So cheapest possible break pads may be fine, but I notice the car stops nice and smooth and the brakes have no tendency to grab, I wouldn't want to get surprised if I had to stop from a high speed, as may happen with poorly made parts. Part of the reason parts cost so much is the Italian car tax sure, but only part of it.",Maserati

I definitely smile every time I drive it. 

The hate Maserati gets is down to the fact they do depreciate like crazy, and folks obsessed with value for money taking issue with that because they see a car as an investment rather than buying something you like for the sake of liking it. If you're ok with that, then it's a great car and definitely a good daily driver. 

Be aware maintenance will be pricey.",Maserati
"BUT $891 for GAP is a lot. If you buy it from the dealer, you shouldn’t have to pay more than $250. Check with your insurance as well, as some companies have it included with your plan, or you can add it for a few dollars per year. 

With the depreciation curve on these things, I 100% would get it. Lastly, once your payoff is equal to the vehicle’s value, you can call the dealer to cancel the policy and they’ll refund you the prorated difference.",Maserati

"I wouldn’t be concerned. With cars like this, people buy them as garage queens that they occasionally take to a a show or date night. Then sell them because they’re scared of any maintenance costs. I’ve owned more than one GT in my life. One all the way up to 86k miles from daily use. Yes, parts/service can be expensive. If you can service it yourself, it’s no more expensive than maintaining a Corvette C7/8.",Maserati
"I would look at how many cars that could use your product even exist, and then try to make an educated guess at what percentage of that market you think you could get. IMO most people that buy cars in this bracket go to the dealer and pay what they want. So your going to have to market to people that use indie garages or DIY (I do a lot of DIY but I don't know about changing a clutch). I think it's going to be a pretty small market.  


Keeping in mind you have to be careful someone doesn't reverse engineer and steal your software, have you considered selling it or licensing it to a clutch manufacturer?

I bought a 2012 gts new and daily drive it. No issues so far except  the electric motor in the passenger seat smells like it's about to burn out. Everything everyone has said is true of the car. Tires have been my biggest expense but I run pirelli pzero on it in summer and sotozero in winter. If I could go back and do it again in would also look for a 2013 to 2015 model mostly because of the seat and also they upgraded the headlight to LED strips which looks a little nicer. I used to do oil changes at the dealership but after I learned these cars depreciate like crazy now i take it to an indy for oil changes etc. Looks simple.enough to to basic maintenance so I might start doing it myself since I found an aftermarket code reader to reset the code OBDSTAR X-200 X200 Pro A and B Configuration Automotive Code Reader Diagnostic Scan Tool Car Scanner for Oil Reset OBD Software EPB With Card Reader https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSXVYDW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_EWI.DbXFS6R3Q here on amazon.,Maserati

But I don't know if you can still find something like that, or if Maserati does something to stop generic map info from working.

You can bet they didn't create their own GPS maps or software, but they may have some way to ""brand"" it to their car so you can't load a generic file. I don't know if you visit the Maserati Life forum, probably the biggest US forum for these cars.

"Depends on what you do. 
If you take it to the dealer it's going to be 10,000. Perhaps more these days. They are going to replace the vvt with updated versions, machine check valves into the oil galleys running to the VVT, and service the timing chain. 

I removed the cam caps and had check valves machined into the oil galley. And avoided the timing part of the job. I was a mechanic so I did it myself. Parts and the machining was 700ish. 

My solution only works if you do it before the VVT gets worn. I did it at 18000 miles. I only heard the rattle because the car was sitting for several months and the oil drained out. But it scared me enough to take preventative action. 

Although I have done many timing jobs on other cars. The Maserati engine is a very technical job. I would not advise attempting it. 

This is not an uncommon issue for vehicles of this early VVT era. However everything is just more expensive because it is a Maserati.",Maserati

If the previous owners haven't addressed the sticky buttons, you will want to find a place that removes the coating safely. Lots of European cars use it, so it's a common fix.

Valve cover gaskets will eventually leak - usually at the back under the dash. Not a really hard job, but quite tedious since many things must be moved and getting the new gasket correctly positioned takes care and much checking. 

A failing battery can manifest itself in strange ways via the body control module. The car may start fine one time, next time the locks won't work, or the lights start flashing. If you encounter strange electrical gremlins, check the health of the battery first.

I dented my front left rim and needed to cosmetically repair the rear left but because I didn’t blow out the tire I wasn’t covered so I filed it on insurance. $2k total for the repair, so not bad. Plus, if you’re blowing out a tire on a curb your whole car is probably gonna be fucked and need insurance to cover cost of repair.

Also, when’s the last time you lost a car key? The Masi car keys are heavy as hell, no way you’re forgetting it’s not in your pocket.

Last piece: you’ll know by the end of your standard warranty if the car is a POS or not. If you’re having problems, bail on it. $6k is not worth it, dude.",Maserati
"As a Ghibli owner, they are no where near as bad as how they are perceived to be.  Maintenance is relatively cheap, and alot of things like oil changes and brakes can be done yourself or Indy mechanic. 

Overall, a good buy for the price point and head turner",Maserati
Pre-2012 also needed the variator and end cap rework which put a lot of QP and GT’s off the road for cheap resale.,Maserati
"And hurts the brand image as well, which of course ties into brand value and subsequent financial health (or lack thereof)",Maserati

He used it as a true off-road vehicle in Costa Rica and then drove it up to Mexico.  The paint is the Bianco Alpi color.  I may consider a wrap.,Maserati
Over priced.,Maserati
If you want to lose 65 percent of the value of the car go with a Ghibli.  Before i get downvotes. Thats thats the residual on the lease.  Its 35 percent for 36 months.  Not saying Audi holds so amazing but compare to a Ghibli…,Maserati
I was just at my local MaseratI/Ferrari dealership and they had a few of these MC20s on the showroom. Even more impressive in person. Congrats to your dad indeed.,Maserati
You can get 20k off of a brand new one with a 90k MSRP.,Maserati
Yeah cars in the Netherlands are generally quite expensive compared to the United States.,Maserati
Oh wait till you start working on this lol,Maserati
"A Honda HRV. Looks nice but it's a complete and utter failure IMHO. They ditched the magic seats which were great for cargo, switched the frame it's based on and lost mpg. 

Should have kept the seat capability and old frame and offered a hybrid variant with it.

Also the center console area sucks.",Maserati

Junk,Maserati
"That's a poser.

The side elements (intakes) are too high.
Pop-up/ fixed screen on the dashboard (Audi style), not typical.
Exhaust pointing downwards. Typical Civic modder.
Tail lights not up to par.
Ohh not to mention rear window, is too straight.

I'm willing to say this is a Toyota perhaps?",Maserati
"No, it was 3rd party. The guy said they don’t underwrite it. Whether he was talking about his dealership or Maserati in general, I don’t know. He did say the loss ratio is 170%

congratulations - sweet!   I just picked up a Grecale and I love her.,Maserati
I was just going through my settings yesterday looking for something else. I don’t think you can remove the miles from the screen. Dry erase marker?,Maserati
"The automatic in '14 GT shifts so well in manual mode that you will not miss having a standard, IMO. Also don't forget it's touring car, not really a true sports car, so really a full automatic with a manual paddle shift ability is the most natural setup.  
Annnnnnd.....I think one of the big things that give them a rep as an expensive car to own is the manual clutch replacements. The clutch plates wore out really fast, which okay in  a performance car you want a clutch that grabs and sticks but then that means it's going to be softer and wear out faster. (I believe they are made from some sort of Italian cheese). And a clutch is not something most backyard mechanics are going to be DIY'ing. I do most of my maintenance but I doubt I would try it.  
The ZF automatic is pretty much bullet proof and fun to drive.",Maserati
"Nice, maybe slap some 15mm-30mm wheel spacers on it",Maserati
That is a really sharp looking car!,Maserati
"Have had an ‘05 CC for 10 years.

No dramas with it at all. Although a groomer snapped the plastic pin in the gear box selector which I got repaired for a few hundred bucks.",Maserati

At least they get points for creativity. The portholes and C pillar badging along with the hubcaps are cute.,Maserati
"Bad idea. I own a Ghibli SQ4, and while I love it, it's not a car to play with without a warranty. Repairs are expensive. If you're going to get a Ghibli, I definitely wouldn't recommend a 14. That was the first model year, and they had tons of issues. Try to get an 18 and up. I would chance an 18 and up without a warranty. Anything earlier, absolutely not.",Maserati
I’m opposite because a leased vehicle is like renting a house in my opinion. If you like making your house exactly the way you want it then you avoid renting whenever possible. I wouldn’t lease because I like to customize my cars. I like vehicle wraps. I like performance exhaust systems etc.,Maserati
"If your car was parked in a parking garage, there is a possibility that there are cameras and you may be able to track down the owner.",Maserati

"I love my levante, I bought it new in 2023 and it’s perfect. My husband and I don’t have any kids yet, so I’m not sure about car seats but, it seems big enough to fit one.",Maserati
"My daily is a 2013 Granturismo MC and I had a regular 2013 Sport a few years ago. Went from a Corvette C8 daily back the MC. They're fantastic cars. I drive \~30 miles a day. I put +80k miles on my Sport. My MC currently has \~58k.   


Now, I work on my own cars 95% of the time. If you're taking your cars to a shop everytime, you're going to be paying ridiculous prices since it's exotic. If you DIY, it's very reasonable. Parts and maintenance are about the same cost as my C8 parts.  

The only thing people really complain about is the tech. The radio is trash and it still has a flip key until 2019, but it's all easy to upgrade. Check out Elliot Motorsports. I have a full digital dashboard, keyless remote, and a new head unit styled after the 2024 Granturismo. Few thousand and you're nearly the same as the new one. Personally, these look much better to me, especially the MC. Plus you get the Ferrari V8.   


Sticky buttons are normal with any Italian car from before 2018. Our Ferrari has it just as bad. It's better in the new ones. You can refinish them, but I just took the time to clean the topcoat off properly. Not worth it.",Maserati
"Honestly, I want pure beast especially when it comes to sound and performances. Even though some say that Alfa’s sound is one of the best, I like SQ4’s more.
Performances are clearly on Giulia’s side but Ghibli’s are more than solid. I mean, I won’t race it (maybe sometimes🫢)",Maserati
"I appreciate all your responses guys, very helpful.  Anything in particular I should keep an eye out for?  Mechanical problems, tech issues, etc?",Maserati
Chryslerati. Only built a few.,Maserati
"Was looking in to them aswell, thanks",Maserati
"No. You are fine!  It is the lack of response folks get here that frustrates me a little. I have an older QP now and some 4200s so I can't really weigh in on a Levante. And the brand is subject to so many unfair canards about expense and reliability. So when someone is trying to learn, it would be great if folks would engage. 

I was just suggesting you will get a good response on either of those forums...

Sorry that I came across hostile to you. Not my intent, at all.  I sincerely hope you find a Maser to fall in love with...!",Maserati
"Oh I see. In that case, yes :)",Maserati
Thank you! Maybe it's the best for me to wait.,Maserati

"Lots of people know that Maserati has awful reliability and the last statistic I read was that 75% of them are leased. They are known for breaking down and having awful electrical issues.

Yes, they look nice and sound great. Though the reliability is known around the world in the car community as absolute trash.

Maseratis are known as the 30k millionaire as they depreciate quickly.",Maserati
That’s a Chryslerati. Actually a nice K car with good looks and some 2.2L Turbo action. Same engine that was used in the first Vectors. Ive owned Dodge 600s and I would love to own one these or even better a LeBaron with faux wood paneling. American Splendor!,Maserati
Same push start as ram trucks 😂😂 Stellantis,Maserati
"I only take it to the dealership. My attitude is (just like any other brand of Luxury car) if you can afford a Maserati, you can afford the costs that come with it.  


My Volvo only gets serviced at the Volvo dealership, my BMW goes to BMW, Mercedes to Mercedes. I maintain service records for all of my cars.",Maserati
Great photo,Maserati
Alfa better made imo,Maserati
It’s the cost factor. People purchase and aren’t prepared to maintain or keep up the costs for repair… these are thouroughbred cars that need a lot of tlc.,Maserati

Is the touchscreen broke or anything wrong with it?,Maserati
"I think that is my plan. I mean I don't think I'll ever call the dealership again 🤣 he was quoting me 18,000 for just a new motor and I wanted to cry. I feel privileged to own this car so young and my heart broke this morning on that phone call.",Maserati
"Yeah I don't mind the stereotype. I'm an inhabitant of the south, but very far from the southern stereotype. I just love rowing through the gears of a V8 6spd manual. My daily driver is a Kia EV6.  Also another hold up that I have with the GT, them not being available in a true manual. But the car is absolutely beautiful and has me a bit infatuated (only after I learned that I can actually buy one, I tend not to daydream about stuff I cannot acquire)",Maserati
Even better in real life,Maserati

"You broke two rules: early model year car, and owning an exotic in the middle of nowhere

Funny story the back side window on those piles of shit had a problem with becoming a parabolic lens causing the interior to catch on fire in high sunlight conditions,Maserati
The local one here in the showroom is in black. Lovely. I tend to agree with you though on the depreciation.,Maserati
"The big thing is that an engine number of less than 148697 is potentially susceptible to variator issues.  This is an expensive fix. Additionally, ensure it is equipped with the yellow Bilsteins and not skyhook I read somewhere that there was a 10% take rate for Skyhook on Sport GT S which you likely don’t want. Other things are subframe issues if you live in an area where they salt roads, I believe YouTuber Jayemm discussed this and mentioned that replacement parts for this are hard to come by.

They literally booked me for like over four months out. Since I got the car out of warranty, I said screw that lol. In about a year and a half I’ve just needed oil changes, new brake pads, and I did have them do the recommended 60,000 mile maintenance per jaguar. No complaints.

"They got more reliable when it comes to individual parts and electronics, especially with the big refresh in 2018.

That said, the Levante and Ghibli are the same vehicle.",Maserati
"Keep in mind the region, this price is after all taxes for customs and so on. I believe the price pre taxes is about 100k usd. It also has a few upgraded specs. Aside from the price what do you think about the modena. And also what do you this is a estimate of a fair price.",Maserati
I’d rather ride Levante,Maserati
"There are 3 style menus and you can actually preset them to stick to your eco/sport/race mode respectively.

"There is so much subjective elements on car depreciation that I don't even care about it anymore.
It could be due to mechanical quality, looks, volume of sales (hello BMW) or some blogger writing crap about it with a 30min test drive.

"Hey thank you! I did end up buying a 2008 GT auto. It only has 18k miles with records. Since I was a tech for a long time as well, my concern was difficult to diag driveability issues, since I don't have the factory scanner. As well as things that really require a hoist. So the main reasons I got it was it seemed simple, no GDI, no AWD, no turbos, no dsg. It's been great so far until yesterday. 
Driving home last night in high gear, low rev, (so heavy load) check engine light started blinking. Noticed some miss-firing, but nothing too bad. Scanned it and only had a multiple a random missfire fault  and misffirss faults for cyl 5, 7 and 8. It's also has had a slightly-less-than-perfectly-smooth idle since I bought it, but no one, but me, could tell. Plugs are original and due for change based on time, but not mileage. Pulled the plugs and they look a little carboned. Which kinda goes with the history of the car since it only had 18k miles put on it in 12 years by the previous owner. Guessing the guy before me drove it around like a grandma.   The fact that the missfires were all on one bank does slightly concern me, but there were no other fault with the generic OBD2. 
Plugs are ordered and should be here Christmas Eve. Fingers crossed.",Maserati

For tips all I would suggest really is keeping the battery on a tender if you don’t take it on longer trips because the electronics get confused sometimes. Also if it has the stock alignment turn the wheel and check the wear on the inside of the tires often.,Maserati

"Good to hear! The steering feel seems amazing on Alfas. I drove a Tesla recently and it was the worst I have ever felt, coming from a manual WRX owner

"The general theory of these things, I'm talking for every modern car, is that there is a little plastic box with a motor and some gears inside, it is used to flip the little doors in the climate system to direct the air in different directions.    
I changed these on my American made car a few years ago, there were three of them and the dash did not have to come completely, for a GM product they were about $30 each.

The one you get from the Maserati dealer with the Italian car tax, is probably going to be in a lot of different cheaper makes and models if you can source it.",Maserati
"I had a '13 then upgraded to an '18. However, the newer interface is silo'd from the rest of the car (basically there to integrate the rear view camera) so it's no different than going aftermarket. You're just as well off choosing a '13 to '17 in the colour/specs/miles/condition you want and adding one of the several aftermarket infotainment systems. See the Maseratilife forums for more info.

"Because part of it is based on sales. They simply don't sell that many cars or suvs. Plus they're overpriced and depreciate like a rock.

Now as for reliability, they're reliable like any modern car. What is their continued Achilles heel is the price of parts and  service.  Simply put other brands are cheaper.",Maserati
"Man I wish it was as you said, I'd like nothing more than that, but that's sadly not possible. I'm barely holding on to middle class....

"I got some money, but not $2400 because the button is sticky money.",Maserati
"I don't see anything weird about that. The last interesting cars (in the affordable part of the market) Maserati produced were the 4.7 QP and GT, granted the GT was around for a long time but it was still from 2007.",Maserati

"Did they not offer you the Maserati official extended warranty and only offered the 3rd party one?  I realize they make way more money selling the 3rd party one, but I am generally skeptical of 3rd party warranties after a horrible experience I had (not on a Maserati).

"I am man, thank you seriously",Maserati
"Agreed. Perception is a major contributor to what the market price for any given item can be but it’s not necessarily reality. Maserati has an image problem but the reality is that they make excellent cars that push the boundaries of performance. A Rolex doesn’t tell time any better than an Omega or a Tag but the perception among buyers is that it does hence the higher retail prices and better resale value of a Rolex. Something I find fascinating about a lot of rich people is that they would avoid ever buying a Maserati because it’s not as expensive as a Ferrari. They actually want to pay the higher price because they want to tell their golf buddies that they could drop $400,000 on a car.",Maserati
Just to clarify. It’s a Levante SQ4. And idk if it’s just me… but it seems like it’s louder than my hubby’s Modena. Even though it’s the same engine…. Can someone clarify if it’s just me or did they change the exhaust for 22,Maserati

How much is your regular maintenance cost considering pulling the trigger on a 2019 trofeo,Maserati
">Paying thousands for breaks is stupidity

Depends what you are getting. For some things I will go cheap, but who makes the $200 eBay brakes? I'm not putting this much effort in to buying and maintaining a car only to put dubious quality Chinese parts on it. I'm not saying go to the dealer and only buy from them. But there are trusted companies that are a decent in between point. Oil filters are a good example. I think the dealer charges well over $100 for just the part. A specialty aftermarket place might be around half that. Then someone told me they got one for like $15 from eBay. No thanks, I'm not trusting the $15 version on an engine that costs so much to repair.",Maserati
$1500,Maserati
Of course- the catch is the parts many times aren’t exactly inexpensive! Sensors and such can actually cost.. shoot I needed a coolant tank and that thing was expensive.. AC compressor also- NOT CHEAP!,Maserati

It did this since brand new out of show room, cause I didn't drive it enough I always thought to go back when I'm free until I realize the warranty has already expired (3000km since 2015).

Big mistake pricing the car over $300K when its almost indistinguishable from prior year ones that now cost $30K.

"Yea if you aren’t driving for very far/long it may not have enough time to fully return the charge. Especially on the the latest gen with all of the electronics that seem to run all of the time.

I had this happen on a MY17 Ghibli, I pulled the battery and took it to autozone, they tested it and it was done for ended up getting a new one.

"Of course! Yeah a stock Maserati sounds better than 99% of production cars out there. When you upgrade to an aftermarket exhaust it takes it to an even higher level. Yeah the severe depreciation is a shame for Maserati’s bottom line but a huge benefit for us. Ferrari assembles both the twin turbo V6 and the twin turbo V8 that go in the Levante so you can rest easy knowing that the most detail-oriented technicians in the world were the people who assembled the engine in your wife’s car. Also, I love that Maserati doesn’t change up the transmissions too often. The ZF 8-speed automatic that’s in your wife’s car has been used by Maserati for years and it’s bulletproof. It’s used in lots of BMW models along with the Land Rover Range Rover and a couple of the Rolls Royce models as well. Audi and Bentley use them too.

If you can stretch the budget - get LC500, it will be the rarest, best GT and definitely a future classic. 
Jaguar is cheaper to maintain then Maserati (do not go to the dealer), the parts are cheaper as well and easier to find.
Maserati sounds better, Jaguar has more power than Alfa.
Alfa has a better driving and handling, Alfa Quad is really special. 
Best overall would be LC500. 
2011-2013 QP5 sound absolutely glorious.

 I made 80kUS a year when I bought it. 


 I was also a professional mechanic for 7 years. 


I daily a 2003 VW Jetta.


I still have anxiety with that car and  only drive it for special occasions and date nights. 


It's not that it hasn't been a good car. It's been a fantastic car. I bought it with 18,000 miles and it has about 60k now.
 

 Realistically it's more reliable than any other high horsepower European car I can think of. It's also extremely fun to drive and a beautiful sound. It also gets far more attention than any Porsche, Mercedes or BMW. 


That being said all it would take is one major mechanical problem and it would turn into a huge loss. 


Realistically it's the same issue that you're going to have with any car that was originally over $100,000 that is now depreciated into a price range that is affordable. 


If you're going to get one make sure you get a model that doesn't have the VVT issue and has the normal ZF transmission. If you don't know what those things are I would suggest getting on the Maserati life forums and doing some sincere research.


I literally went on the scuderia parts website I went through part by part to see how much ball joints were going to cost, bushings were going to cost, alternators were going to cost etc. 

It needs premium gas. And if you want to hear the engine you're going  you going to get 11 miles per gallon. That is honestly your biggest expense. Next for me is insurance, tires and registration. 


I don't regret buying mine, I also can't bring myself to sell it lol.

That’s the issue. A company who has bad second hand values will have slower sales, and will struggle to keep up with its more successful competitors, and that’s before those other companies can capitalize on a CPO program where the company with poor resales will lose money or make far less. 

It’s just bad all around for everybody but the person who buys a heavily depreciated vehicle.",Maserati

"Having had both, I can tell you I am more than happy to have allll the Masers.",Maserati
"Good to know about specific engine numbers. 

From what I recall, the Sport GT S could not be optioned at all with Skyhook, fixed Bilstein’s only. However, this is a Ferrari-owned product (at least they were at the time) and we all know how much Ferrari LOVES to lie about production numbers and what the cars could and couldn’t get lol.",Maserati

I ordered a bmw m4 competition. I wanted a convertible,Maserati
lol OP take battery out. Go and get it tested at auto zone. I bet it’s probably appearing charged but just overall not enough amps flowing.,Maserati
"Get the hardtop. I absolutely LOVE convertibles but for the GT it just looks mehh. It takes away from the artistry of the vehicle, the fierceness, the menacing “I’m bout bout to eat that ass” look, especially with it being a soft top. Now had they done a nice hardtop convertible, possibly would be a different story. But the soft looks like it’s only for English Royal families lol.",Maserati

"Big infrequent service items like new spark plugs, front brakes and rotors etc. in addition to oil change/alignment/regular items, which totalled $4k, then $11k covered replacing the variators (common failure point on older GTs, $6,500), TPMS module (common failure point, hard to obtain parts, $1k), RH front control arm and bushing (common failure point, $2k), and a few other minor things.

I recommend joining the ‘Maserati GranTurismo Owners Society’ group on FB and scrolling through the various posts on there to get an idea of things people end up fixing on these cars. Also a great place to ask questions.",Maserati

That looks like the auto start icon. Check the battery maybe someone disconnected it. You should see a connector that comes off the hot side terminal on the battery. I disconnected mine but can't remember if the icon showed on the dash or not.,Maserati

"Not sure, but the valve covers are easy. The coolant hose that everyone gets worried about isn't that bad either. Is the vvts you have to worry about lol. Mostly because it requires tearing apart the front of the engine and retiming. But like all the cars from this era had VVT issues. It was new technology.  At this point I'm convinced  it's all just propaganda to drive the price of Ferraris up. They're honestly really good cars. I daily mine and drive it like it's any other car. Parts are expensive. But it is what it is.

Also the vvts were an issue for a subset of cars. And you can easily get ahead of it by machining a check valve in the cam cap. It's like $700 and a weekend of work",Maserati

"Well, we've got some right grumpy purists on here! For what it's worth, I do think it's a beautiful car, stock. But I also appreciate the joy of putting your mark on it and how gratifying it is to know that you have something unique. 
For my Ghibli I fitted a splitter on the front and a small tip spoiler on the back. I don't want to radically change the look, but I would like to black out the wheels and ""chrome delete"" the rest of the car (mine is white), as well as finding a nice rear diffuser (the rear is the weakest part of the car, visually, imo) - just something to make it slightly more aggressive.

Could be a dead battery,Maserati
"A good shop that deals with modern higher end cars will have an electrical system tester that can tell them if the battery or alternator  is failing. The battery is not cheap. 

If that doesn't solve things, a brand specific code reader which is much more detailed is very expensive and you should look for techs who advertise servicing Maseratis/Ferraris. They pay thousands to have access to the latest codes and resolutions. Not cheap, but not as expensive as dealers usually.

The valve cover gasket tends to show up as smoke under the hood after the car warms up. Don't worry until that shows up.

I’m not mechanically inclined at all, and it’s my only car, so I couldn’t have it out of action while I tried tinkering, so your experience with the same issues would be different, but definitely note that even the parts will be much pricier on these than the other weekend cars you referred to.",Maserati
"I have a convertable, never had one before and always thought they were a little gay to be honest.

I wouldn't suggest it takes too much away from the hardtop looks but the benefit you get is so much more. The top has 3 layers and is pretty quiet when closed.

Chances are, one of your favourite things about this car is the sound ... and fuck me, what a massive difference when the top is down, it sounds amazing and you never want to drop below 3000rpm.

Other thing is when you're going for a nice drive, a convertable let's you take in your surroundings.

I wouldn't worry about the exterior looks because you'll be in it anyway. You do get much more looks with the top down than up but the long story short is, with the top down, the engine sounds so good you will never turn the shitty radio on.",Maserati

Get a new battery.  I had a prev gen quattroporte when Maserati was still part of Ferrari and it too had a completely dead battery if I let it sit for more than a week.  Battery in trunk with electronic trunk release was an interesting situation for sure. LOL.  Most likely your battery is toast and a tender is not enough to bring it back…. Aka surface charge.,Maserati
"I have a late 2016 and it ticks all the boxes you've stated. If you're lucky enough to get a later model then I'd say you're going to be very happy... I'd advise going for something with reliable service history and decent options. 

The bad rep often comes from people being shocked how expensive it is to have a car serviced by Ferrari specialists, getting cheap servicing, then complaining when it goes wrong.

"What’s up u/DTE_Systems

Don’t want to sell a unit?  

Your Power Control RX 3 setting with 5 levels within each.  Sport
In Sport mode, the engine’s parameters are modified for maximum performance. The vehicle reacts more directly for a more responsive driving experience.
Dynamic
The Dynamic mode is a great all-rounder and very well balanced for long distances. The vehicle reacts more dynamically for better agility throughout the rpm range.
Efficiency (for PowerControl X only)
The Efficiency mode is focused on improving the engine’s fuel consumption. Savings of up to 15% can be achieved. 

Won’t setting your unit via phone app conflict with the Trofeo’s own settings - for example:
Setting yours in Sport Mode higher setting but then setting Maserati’s own driver select mode into “Comfort”?  Or setting yours in “Efficiency mode” and setting Maserati’s own drivers select mode in Corsa?",Maserati

You should be able to find loads of them in that price range. Very small differences between years IMO and infotainment upgrades happen in 2018.  Aftermarket exists, but mixed reviews and they are decoupled from the car fully (no car telemetry on screen IIRC). 
The slight HP improvements are nice but not earth shattering.

"Hi! No, the dealer only gave me the front and back rubber mats, but not the trunk or net one. I was planning on purchasing it on Jan/2 that I'll be there for the All Season tires. 

If you have them and you're good parting ways with it (it does take space anywhere), I'll be more than happy to pick them up Thank You!!

I did get in contact with Glenview with no luck, because it is considered a ""used"" vehicle, whatever the keys are included is what you get. Anil said that they were working with Maserati because it was not with the original package then they received the vehicle, but once they knew it was traded in, they dropped all efforts. He said that if I wanted it, I had to order it as a part and have it coded, sounds like too much hassle.",Maserati

There aren't many things more expensive than cheap Italian cars.,Maserati
"Think of it this way, it’s an Italian sports car designed for the driver enthusiast. It has no arm rests or cup holders, as they distract from the driving experience. Question: how much time, thought and attention do you think the Italian Purists who built this great sports car put into the auto mode? Now divide that by ten. It’s really bad in auto, shifting is all wrong and way too early, you’re going to be in fifth gear by 30 miles an hour. My best advice is drive one for yourself and experience it for real. Some people can live with it, and others accept it, in order to get the awesome driving experience that is manual/paddle mode. 

Now, here’s the other angle: teach your wife how to drive it in manual mode. I did exactly that, and we both had a great time. Nothing sexier than a woman driving a Maserati the way it was designed to be driven and loving every moment.",Maserati

"Our dealer group just sold a Maserati store. Its a great looking car. That is where it stops. It sounds like shit. They missed the mark by not dropping a V8 in there.  It depreciates at an insane rate i never seen on a car before.  I have driven all the cars you mentioned and the Turbo S is the best of the bunch.  It is very reliable and there is a reason why it holds up the best value out any of those cars.  Ferrari 458,488 is close second. But you cant put the miles on them like you can on a 911.",Maserati

I don’t know what Maserati expected to happen to their brand image when they began aggressively marketing in all their sales literature for the past 20 years about the Ferrari engine inside their vehicles. When the heart of your car belongs to Ferrari and is designed by Ferrari then you have an identity problem right from the beginning.,Maserati
"First of all, *great* list of choices. My last purchase came down to Jag vs Alfa (with Maserati a close third, but slightly out of my budget unless I went with an older one).  Only difference is I wanted 4 doors. 

Ultimately, the Jag had a little more power for the money. While also having the uniqueness and presence of an Alfa. If I was in the market for a 2dr sports car, it would have to be a V8 F-type",Maserati
Wow over 100k miles,Maserati
🤣 my reaction as well,Maserati

"My experience has been all fixed with software updates, and I was expecting that since it is the 1st year of a brand new model.

The only one that nobody knows where it went, was the rear cross alert system, We got messages about being disabled, or spotty error with this alert randomly, whether we were driving or coming to a stop. I'm pretty sure the sensor connection got wet or something after a car wash, but just like that, it went away and we've not seen that error again. Now is the opposite, it is too sensitive, as I'm backing up out of the garage, it thinks that where the curb meets the road is a hazzard, and does an emergency stop, this is happening on both Grecales 🤷🏻‍♂️

"This may not be helpful, but I've had problems with start/stop in every vehicle that's had it equipped. My mini cooper has been flawless except for the start/stop, which activates when it shouldn't (such as putting the car into park), among other things. It also causes the engine Temps to rise, being turbocharged, when ideally you want to let a turbo car idle to lower Temps in a safe manner rather than just shutting down. I just keep auto start stop disengaged now. If you read some testing data on start stop it only increases mpg by like 0.1 or something ridiculous. It's a completely useless or even detrimental feature imo",Maserati
My wife just got a Grecale and it's annoying AF. I can't say anything about it to her because once I point it out she'll become obsessed and start to hate the car.,Maserati

This is very similar to posts that come up on my AMG site.  Most people say you should be grateful and others say the most common issue is the battery is a bit on the flat side.  Not enough to cause problems but enough for the computer to disable something like auto start/stop that would put a huge drain on it.  I’d say it’s the battery.,Maserati
"I love these cars, just rented the sport non convertible. the sound is 10/10.

Can easily overtake or drag at the lights, if that's your thing. But I'm never going to be street racing or anything like that. 
For me, the Maserati will sound incredible, has enough punch to back up the look and sound, and you will probably feel special driving it. But as others have rightly said, a test drive will let you know what car is right, FOR YOU!

Yes, the servicing and parts are more expensive than mass-produced cars, but it's a Maserati ffs! And if you get one that's been looked after, and you look after it, I think it's really rewarding. 
People are quick to write these cars off, because they aren't the most economical, or the fastest, or the quickest round corners, but they make you FEEL something! 
Besides, you're not exactly going to do track days in it. And show me someone who doesn't honestly love how they sound and I'll show you a liar!",Maserati
"I test drove the Macan yesterday. I think it looks great from the outside and meets a lot of my criteria but I thought it was a tad underwhelming inside - nowhere to put your phone, no wireless charging, not a lot of tech etc. 

I guess many of those would also apply to the Ghibli. But I felt with the Macan that only truly “nice” thing inside is the Porsche logo, whereas the Ghibli seems to have a nicer interior, more luxurious look",Maserati
The battery is old. And the engine would not fire up. But two days later it did … go figure,Maserati
"Also...counterintuitively, these need to be driven.",Maserati
You got money for maintenance? If you want a fun car for the same price get a s197 mustang,Maserati
"Maseratis are expensive to maintain, service, and repair.  You may be in for a rude awakening.",Maserati
That’s the start stop system. Could just be that the battery doesn’t have enough juice for it. Drive it around for another few days to see if the battery charges enough for it to go away. Start stop sucks anyway so you’re better off without it.,Maserati
No…I loved mine RIP….the electronics are a little dated IMO compared to other similar cars but every car has a few dislikes,Maserati
"Pull it out, clean the contacts and replace it making sure the connection is tight. You can get a pretty cheap replacement unit if that doesn’t fix the problem",Maserati
"That’s really true. When you hear a GranTurismo and ride in one and drive one you quickly realize that it’s almost criminal that they can be purchased for $20,000 at the bottom end and the car you’re getting is worlds better than whatever else you could get for $20,000. That’s just my opinion but you’re absolutely right that the people shitting on Maserati cars have never even driven them, they just repeat what they read on the Internet.",Maserati
"Sorry about the late replies guys, I got all my stuff except the interior RGB lighting via this guy on Youtube [https://www.youtube.com/@caymanspyder1593](https://www.youtube.com/@caymanspyder1593)

Its worth between 16k to 25k. You are not impressing anyone.,Maserati
"I loved the R8 for the same reasons. But the darn thing just doesn’t depreciate much. Good if you buy new, not so much if you’re waiting to pick one up off lease.

I completely agree that the MC20 scratches that same itch (for me). It’s uncommon and beautiful to look at. I want to see how it depreciates over the next couple of years. Maybe it’ll come down into a range where it makes sense in my head.",Maserati
Yes it’s from 1989.,Maserati
It's the right way to go. Sorry that they tried to exploit you like that. These are amazing (and underrated) cars...congratulations on it!  And on not allowing yourself to be taken advantage of.,Maserati
That's a Mazda.,Maserati
"Maintenance is not cheap compared to the majority of car brands out there.  The real cost of a Maserati is not in the purchase price but in the insurance, maintenance, and repair.  

Many parts have to be ordered from Italy.  You’ll also need to take it to a service center that works on Maseratis, which of course costs more.  Tires are about $250 each and brakes run a few grand.  Even the gas needs to be the supreme or whatever the most expensive option is called.

I’ve had to have the throttle sensor, rotors, breaks, tail light, head light sensors, and probably some stuff in forgetting all before 40k miles on a 2017.
I can only imagine that someone spending $16k on a 2016 with 75k miles is probably not going to be able to handle a very possible $3-5k a year in maintenance plus another $3-5k in insurance.  

My advice is save up for a newer model with less miles.  Don’t fall for the cheap sticker price… ownership is not cheap by any means.",Maserati
"I looked at several different things when I bought the GT.  I love the Quads/QV's or whatever you want to call them.  I looked at some Porches BMW, Merc, the M's and AMG"" s but I also looked at Jag F Type and a couple Aston Martins.  None of them had the true exotic car feel that the GT does.  And nothing sounds better than a GT.",Maserati
You know enough about cars to appreciate the engine but not enough to know how preposterous what you're asking is.  Interesting.,Maserati
And labor,Maserati
Any exotic can and will have some issues. But the idea that these cars are fatally unreliable is just not accurate.,Maserati
Damn sexy ride,Maserati
"Well, that's just been part of the ownership shuffle there over time. And Ferrari was able to effectively produce a slightly detuned line of sedans and grand tourers without eating into its own market share.",Maserati
"Oof, even if mechanics are cheaper in Poland, I’m afraid replacement parts are going to kill your budget. I’d say no, unless you don’t pay for housing or food or…anything else basically. Isn’t gasoline expensive in Poland too?",Maserati
Good luck! Tag me in the before and after pics!,Maserati
Cost to buy and cost to own are spread way different. Cost to own brings cost to buy down.,Maserati
I can tell you why….Its a Maserati,Maserati
"Imo, don’t be that guy. I can appreciate a good mod setup, but some cars shouldn’t be modded much if at all. 

The black paint and rims combo is bringing down the look of your vehicle pretty substantially as-is. I’d invest in proper rims if you’re shooting to look cooler.",Maserati
"They haven’t sold some 22s so they are still on the lot. 

It’s not a scam or a fraud in any way.",Maserati
"I completely see your point of view. I myself drive the Ghibli casually (as a beater), so I don’t use OEM parts. Which like you mentioned, would and could definitely be expensive. 

I typically buy aftermarket parts from either AutoZone, Rock Auto, or even EBay/Amazon. I keep extra parts on hand just in case something DOES require replacing. This way, at least for me, the parts are inexpensive. 

As far as tires, I buy either used ones with high life left, or “OFF” name brands that are cheap (around $80/tire). If I do find sets of 2 or 4, I just stock up on them. 

Again, this is just my own experience on the Gibli (we have a Levante as well).  Cheers",Maserati
"My recommendation is to find a mechanic near you that would work on it, where I live is has been hard because 99% of them don’t want to touch it, and the ones that do are extremely busy, which leaves me stuck with the dealership and at dealership inflated prices, but I have been very happy with my 2014 for 3 years now.",Maserati

"Get it stolen, totaled and cash out on insurance. In minecraft ofcourse.",Maserati
One of the car channels on YT that I watch pointed out that a lot of shops won't work on them just because of the liability. Even though the GT is easy to work on if you damage a body panel or something that may be a few hundred bucks on an average car you can be in to several thousand to make it right.,Maserati
"Thank you! This is really helpful. Did you end up just putting it in the middle seat? 

The rear facing recommendations have changed dramatically since my last baby. They practically want them in college before you can turn their seat forward.",Maserati
It will shock you how quick and nimble that car is.  I was expecting a feel like your 3 series but it drives so much better.  It really is a fun car.  I've had that one for 4 years now and have driven it basically every day.,Maserati

Are the ZF transmissions the more reliable ones? I've worked on variants of ZF-6HP and I really liked it. I could even cut down on some costs by using Ford fluids and parts (from the Navigator) instead of BMW. The Navigator stuff was literally the exact same as the BMW stuff just 10% of the price.

"The Chrysler TC by Maserati, it actually was my first car, I bought mine for a grand and god was it a piece of garbage. It’s essentially a Chrysler LeBaron with a Maserati logo slapped onto every surface of the car they could. My details on its history are a bit foggy, but even though it was “jointly” made by both Maserati and Chrysler, Maserati back then just wanted hardly anything to do with it other than the logo and credit. It’s a Chrysler engine, maybe 10% of the body was from Maserati. It practically took the absolute worst from both the manufacturers and at the time the price tag was ridiculous. I consistently was called mine the “Chinese bootleg Maserati” by my peers in automotive lol, I don’t even blame them, the electrical was practically gone and the brakes went out twice on me, sold it for like 800$ in the end. It does at least have a hardtop convertible if that’s your forte, but it is prone to leakage",Maserati

"I just joined reddit for this reason, I'm a Maserati tech and I feel like I could be helpful. granturismos are fairly stout cars, but the issue with all maseratis is maintenance and cost of upkeep, if you want to own one and keep it nice plan for atleast 5k a year, the engines and 6 speed of automatics are fairly reliable but the f1 clutch is another animal and will definatly go bad wrong at some point and you will be looking at a bill anywhere from a few thousand to 10k. if you have decided to get one make sure you get all maintenance records for it and if you can pick up one that is certified by Maserati that's a much better route. another note is that I have seen people pay up to 13k for aftermarket warranties on gts and them deny everything when you need it so read your fine print carefully",Maserati

"You'll go through rear tires every 10-12K miles, and get maybe 15K for the fronts (assuming you don't granny it everywhere). A decent tire is going to run $300 per corner up front, and around $350 per corner rear.Handling gets quite squirrelly in the wet if rear tread depth is near the limits.  

Brake pads run a gamut of prices, but with most running around $200-500 up front, and a bit less out back. Rotors might be needed every 2nd or 3rd pad change, and depending on the type you choose, can run as much as $500 per corner.

The correct pre-tested oil filter will run you around $25-30-ish. The Penzoil Euro synthetic runs around $70 for a case of 6. Car holds between 8-9 quarts. I guess you can do it with jack stands, but the car is pretty low so you'll need a low profile jack.

Fuel economy depends a lot on how you drive it of course, but do not expect anything except teens unless driving exclusively at moderate speeds on the highway.

The rearmost plugs are basically under the dash. It does require leaning waaaaay in there. 

Look for oil leaks on the backs of the cam covers. They like to drip on the cats.

That’s good to hear from someone who has owned both cars. I feel like the GranTurismo gives you a more forgiving ride and also a functional back seat. I can only base my judgement off the handful of rides I’ve taken in the 360 and the GranTurismo but the 360 was more jarring and analog feeling if that makes sense. The F1 transmission shifts hard but the 360 felt more like a track car to me and less like a car I’d want to drive for long periods of time. The GranTurismo was plenty fast but also comfortable and forgiving on long drives.,Maserati
Lovely!,Maserati
"While not a GT, the QPS is similar... 4.7 V8 engine  
\- Sucks fuel, if I wanted fuel efficiency i would have bought a Prius. I do not own a Prius.  
\- Tires: While I love Pirelli tires, get off them for the Masi... go with Michelin Pilot Sport. They last longer/better and do not tram-line as bad as Pirelli. And yes, they still stick to the road.  
\- TPMS has gone out twice so far  
\- Change your oil religiously  
\- Change the rear diff fluid  
\- Consider a custom performance tune. Masi comes conservatively tuned from the factory. There is a good amount of room for performance improvements.  
\- Do your own maintenance as much as you can  
\- Change your spark plugs (although the ones near the cabin are a PITA unless you have the right swivels, extensions, etc.)  
\-AC compressor just went out on mine, $3k",Maserati
"Incorrect. plenty of people work on exotics. Maybe where you live they aren’t that common and that could be part of the issue but here in dallas it’s not that big of a deal. 

There are multiple Indy shops here in Dallas that are more than willing to work on these for much less than dealer prices. 

I had my brakes done for about $3k for all 4 corners by a shop that only works on Italian brands.",Maserati
Beautiful car,Maserati
This is very true.,Maserati
2014 model,Maserati
"Like someone else stated, I would recommend a 2018 and up Ghibli or QP. By the 2018 model year, they had really got these cars sorted. The earlier ones aren't too bad, but the price difference between a 14 and 18 isn't that wide of a gap nowadays. Get the newest model year that you can afford. 18 and up are drastically improved versus the 14-17. Best of luck.",Maserati
"It's good! Needs tires and a control arm bushing. I financed. If you can find a warranty, I would. But I don't know anyone that would offer a warranty. A hood costs 10k lol.",Maserati
"100% manual sports all day. Maybe that’s the problem, it’s an AWFUL automatic, I think on purpose. Best advice I was given was rev it high and “drive it like you stole it”. I did exactly that and had so much fun!",Maserati
If the shoe fits,Maserati
Yeah i think so too. It's hard not to drive it into the ground - I try to limit myself to twice a week.,Maserati
Yearly premium on a 10 year old Prius. Not so much on a Maserati.,Maserati
"But most Ferraris are cheaper over time because they don’t lose as much value. 

I’ve owned several Maseratis and I like them but there is no real comparison with Ferrari which has a much stronger brand, and better products on the whole.",Maserati
I can't afford either. This just popped up in my thread. Idk why I'm even fucking here!,Maserati
"take it to a local shop and have them replace the pan,  just dont start the motor with no oil in it",Maserati
Wow,Maserati
It wont start because its a Maserati.,Maserati
"Hahaha yes I find myself doing the exact same thing in looking for an armrest/or somewhere to place my phone 😭
Mine stays in manual/sports and never leaves  .. the best way to drive it. Auto does feel very lazy & the timing of the changes is not great, but on the highway it’s fine. 
They are very loveable cars. I can’t help but adore it.",Maserati
The GT is definitely an amazing car that is sure to turn heads. Drive it in good health.,Maserati
"I think it needs a new battery.  The car. Not the fob. Transponders in fobs can still allow the car to start even if the battery and the fob is dead it’ll still send the transporter code out to the ignition Tumblr. Sometimes you may have to put it in a slot in the sitter console or in the cupholder that’s in the the owners manual I’m not sure where, but if it was me, I’d go get a new battery for the car. 
Also disconnect power and ground cables on battery and leave them off 10 min. Then reconnect them and see if that helps. But I think the car battery is just dead.  Batt tender won’t bring a dead battery up. Only the big roll around shop chargers will do that.  And it’s just temporary.",Maserati
Can’t you measure your current rotors?,Maserati
What would you suggest as a winter regimen? I park mine on a lift with a battery maintainer. I live in the Boston area so winter driving is not great with all the salt.,Maserati
I’m trying to just get used to it. I am 25% there :|,Maserati
Oh my god... that's amazing,Maserati
"It’s just an Italian GT car with not the same following or perceived value as a Porsche, so they drop a lot in value. And it’s not a Ferrari, which hold their value based on the brand and overall package, parts etc. sports cars seem to be more valuable to people not GT cars. 

I rented one recently, they sound better than almost anything. Super sexy car. They are decently reliable apparently if driven frequently. 

Although I wouldn’t personally buy one unless I made $150/year+. You would need maybe $3k-$5k a year to be safe for repairs/maintenance so I would want that to be a small % of my post tax disposable income.",Maserati
"Correct.  Does what it's designed to do, very well.",Maserati
"The most beautiful car ever made, in my opinion.",Maserati
"Well, I don't know the market there, but 100K is a lot for a Modena",Maserati
heavy on gas but heavenly,Maserati
"Sounds like the issue is you leaving the car without driving in a cold environment for an extended period of time. Buy a noco battery charger/maintainer, connect it to the car's main battery and you won't have any issues anymore.",Maserati
What model year would you recommend?,Maserati
"> Is this the same transmission? 

Yes

> Should this transmission be avoided? 

Not if you understand the plusses and minuses of it and get one with plenty of life left.

> Is it better to wait until a manual comes for sale?

If you want it badly enough you can convert these to manual.",Maserati
How much?,Maserati
Yea thats normal,Maserati
Appreciate it,Maserati
2017 and onwards and you can tell by looking at them because the head unit will not have knobs to the left/right of the screen.,Maserati
Does not do 185…,Maserati
[Golf tee mod](https://www.maseratilife.com/threads/golf-tee-mod-questions.120753/) or get the formula dynamics controller,Maserati
How bad is the general maintenance on that? Found a 2017 GT I’m interested in and am curious,Maserati
I love love love my Coupe,Maserati
"I'd call Formula Dynamics and see what they can offer you. I'd also recommend joining [maseratilife.com](https://maseratilife.com), very active forum that is a wealth of knowledge for these cars.",Maserati
Oh yeah I feel the pain from having to replace a faulty water seal in my m340 and it was 800 for parts and labor last week. How much was the hourly labor cost for the levante?,Maserati
Bad ass,Maserati
Battery.,Maserati
"Steep depreciation hurts the brand and more importantly the financial health of the company. 

It can’t be spun as a positive in any way.",Maserati
"Doug could take off about 10-15% there, but he hits all the points I’m interested in. This is firming as my next car, although prices are still higher in Australia.",Maserati
"Maserati flooded the market and brand cachet took a big hit. But then this type of GT car is often seen as a fashion accessory and those go in and out of fashion pretty quickly no matter the brand. What you need to keep in mind is that just because it is cheap to buy, it is still a $140K car when it comes to servicing.

________________________

You want to go 2013 or newer to be on the safe side - or do some proactive maintenance outlined in the MaseratiLife forums. Coolant hose routed behind the engine over the transmission housing can fail and is very hard to reach. Cam variators also have problems if memory serves.

Avoid the Cambiacorsa F1 style transmission unless you have a solid grasp of how to use an automated manual gearbox and live in a rural area w/o a lot of stop and go. 

The F1 equipped cars got a dry sump engine for lower centre of gravity and a rear mounted transaxle containing the gearbox for 50/50 weight distribution. The ZF auto equiped cars got a wet sump and the trans is front mounted. I think weight distribution changed to 53/47.

Do you maintain your present car yourself? These aren't particularly hard cars to work on compared to some, but parts are not cheap and you should thoroughly research the job before you start to avoid potential pitfalls. It really helps if you have access to a lift, and you'll need a good diagnostics reader (again, see MaseratiLife).",Maserati
Very cool!,Maserati
I think it’s a great choice. You’re gonna love it!!,Maserati
"Don’t have it anymore but I had a 2018 ghibli with 60k miles on it (I put on about half of that myself), and besides regular checkups and oil changes I had absolutely no issues. I personally really liked the car though I know that may be an unpopular opinion these days",Maserati
"Didn’t even say what model- they make the car with 3 different engines, completely different drivetrains also.",Maserati
"Valve cover gaskets take a while because you have to remove a bunch of things and half the engine is under the dash, but it isn't hard. Just slow.",Maserati

"All wheel drive, more HP, and interior luxuries would be the difference.  I would go for a low mileage 2020-2021 SQ4 Gransport for the best bang for your buck.

Here’s the trim level differences

"I would consider a 2020 or newer, perhaps even a 2019 with very low mileage.",Maserati
"Yeah I know it's those major YouTubers don't cover them very well like oh I rented this for 5 hours and I've been driving it for an hour. Let me give you my opinion now. It's like man drive it. I don't know give it a week?look I'll admit they're quirky cars, especially compared to let's say a Volvo which I've owned. Many of my thought process was you know I've always wanted one of these. It's one of my dream cars. I can do a lot of repairs on it myself and maintenance, especially after working on all my Volvo's and other cars. Going to few Volkswagens as well. I think that as long as I take care of it, I shouldn't have any problems unless you know some weird electrical issue comes up or something of that nature. I have read on this particular year that people complain about not being able to put in park. Apparently they would just be stopped and it doesn't recognize the brake switch or something. Maybe I don't know but that's a bridge. I'll have to cross if I come across it. And they do sound absolutely amazing. That's what made me want one so many years ago. Just hearing that motor start up and it's just beautiful and I have no inclination of track day or anything like that I was going to do something like that. I would get probably a Porsche boxster or something.",Maserati
"Thanks!  Yeah everything has been great so far, except for some sticky buttons! 😆 You?",Maserati
"Tell your dad not to go 185.  He'll lose his license and won't drive.  

Did his accountants pay for it all?",Maserati
"Congratulations, looks very cool. Why is there such a big gap between the bumper and the hood",Maserati
"I have one on loan at the moment, upon hearing it my wife immediately said “ it sounds like a ticking bomb” this made me laugh as I imagined it being the sound of the warranty ticking its seconds away and then Boom!",Maserati
"I’m like a half hour from Buffalo, NY",Maserati
"You don’t want a challenger. You want a mustang. Lol. More reliable and more sought after, will hold value more and will never have an issue selling in the future. The s197 style is hot right now. If you can find a 2014 coyote s197 GT for around 20-25k with decent mileage <50k jump on it",Maserati
