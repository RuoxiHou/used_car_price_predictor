"Go drive both for 30 minutes in different settings, the one you prefer should be fairly obvious after that because they're drastically different cars. They also are very different forms, so think about what you may need to transport/haul

If neither stands out to you, then either would probably work.

For me the Forester felt much more open and the visibility was great, gas milage was acceptable, luggage space was really good, and I gravitated towards that.

For my wife she really liked the Crosstrek which handled better and more like a car, was more fun to drive, and got better gas mileage.

" Dash cam of the oil change…with the hood up to change the oil the dash cam has nothing to see!  Sounds like you made this part up.
Engines don’t “hydro lock” from over filled oil. Hydro lock occurs when the cylinder is full of fluid and it tries to compress it.
A “mechanic” would know this. 
Oil from the crankcase cannot physically get into the cylinders unless you blow a head gasket.
Even if the heads were full of oil it cannot get in.
Overfilled oil will cause your crankshaft to be running in oil which is tremendous extra drag so you lose power.
It’s possible it also churn the oil up and thus thin it out, THAT MIGHT cause a rod bearing failure. 
But it was not “hydrolocked”.",subaru
"251’s are in demand because of head gaskets going.

It’s usually cheaper to replace rather then repair.

"Thanks for the advice, I did a compression test when I changed the plugs and all of the cylinders were the same, 160 or 150 I don’t remember, but I don’t think I did a leak down. 

When the engine was replaced the shop said they were changing the ventilation in my gas tank. When I brought the car home it wouldn’t start after getting gas unless I kept the gas cap off for a minute and pushed the throttle a little. After about a month it was able to start with the cap on but it still needed some throttle while idling and then it would be completely fine. The gas pump stops itself constantly so I have to fill it very slowly and calculate exactly how much to put in. For about 6 months this was causing an extremely rough start after getting gas, but now I rarely notice anything just the occasional misfire and p0000 code. I can understand how this would cause that after getting gas, but could this cause that same issue when I turn on the ac and randomly while driving? I haven’t addressed this issue because it got better and I’m not well versed with the fuel tank related things",subaru

You can get invoice pricing instead of MSRP for a donation to various orgs (ASPCA donation is $500 - I saved 2300 for my $500 donation to them last year when I bought mine.) Unfortunately asking here for a price range won't result in much as the prices change pretty drastically depending on where you are in the country.

I also make sure to stay within the service interval to the mile or date, even if it means changing earlier than needed just to avoid going a day or more past due.

I did notice the ""screen"" behind where the filter is has a couple 1 inch long rectangular  ""rubber bumpers"" in the top right and bottom left corners. I feel removing these would likely fix the clearance issues but they seem to be part of the oem inner filter so don't plant to touch that.

"'17 Forester 2.5i, with 52k miles. Bought 7 months ago with 40k miles.

I got in one day and noticed the TPMS light was on. Drove it to Discount Tire to get the tires checked. This (the time I noticed the light) was the last time either one of my key fobs worked too. I can still unlock the door with the key that is attached to the remote, but it sets off the alarm. The only way to stop it is by starting the vehicle, which I can still do. I went to a car key locksmith and they tested both keys and detected frequency emitting from them. I also replaced the batteries in both fobs. Still no success. Again checked all tires and sensors and they are fine. Someone suggested it could be a battery issue, but I had that checked at AutoZone and again, it is totally fine.

I have called and visited a ton of locksmiths and mechanics who don't know what the issue might be off the top of their head (or have never heard of this happening before, but they suspect it is an issue with the car itself (immobilizer, anti-theft system etc.) Called my local Subaru dealer and other mechanics who will charge a pretty hefty diagnostic fee, but since this issue is so specific (key fobs stopped working AND tire pressure light came on at the same time), I'm beginning to think I have no choice but to let a Subaru specialist diagnose the problem.

I really would like to not have to spend upwards of $500+ to get new keys, new immobilizer, diagnostic fee, etc. I have seen posts about how to reprogram your own keys but I'm still so confused about the TPMS light also being on. Maybe that's a separate issue, but I kind of doubt it. Could it be an electrical issue, like a faulty fuse/wire? I did get an oil change the day before this happened, and went back there to ask if they might have messed anything up but they said they don't ever touch anything electrical.

Would really like some help/advice with this.",subaru

"2024 Crosstrek Owner here. I just grabbed the rear-view mirror with one hand and pulled it off the window instead of ""turning"" it around the center of axis.  So mirror is now hanging by the electronic/wire.

So of course I stared at this and figured I could put it back.  There is a hex bolt up on the glass, no damage there.   And a triangular ""spring"" is mounted in the back of the stalk. It's metal, is shaped to be a break-away, very tight spring so I suppose if you bump into it hard, it will break away. 

I don't see how to snap it back into place.  The spacing on the spring is such that you could have two (or one) side of the triangle sitting in place ""on their tab"" so to speak.  But the third ""leg"" of this springy part is so far from fitting the ""snap"" that I just don't see how to mount it.

"This is a standard thing I've done with every car I've owned in the past 15 years. Gas to the floor, turn ignition/press button for a few seconds. Will this be make or break? Definitely not lol. Unless you drained the oil for multiple hours truly allowing all the oil to drip from the engine into the pan and out it'll be 100% fine. I doubt Subaru techs prime the filter before sending customers on their way because it isn't necessary. I got into the habit of it with an older car that would sometimes get airlock on the oil pump after an oil change or long time sitting and do it out of habit now but I doubt it really makes a discernible difference.",subaru

"It’s very important to do the service if you want the car to last. But not at the dealer. At 120k you should change oil, rotate tires, change air and cabin filters, change trans fluid, front diff fluid, rear diff fluid, flush coolant, flush brake fluid, and change spark plugs. Not to mention a thorough once over for safety. 
If you have the tools and know how all of this can be done at home for about $300 in parts and fluids. 
Dealers like to add a lot of fluff like oil and fuel additives, induction services and other crap like that. 
If you can’t do it yourself take it to a local reputable shop and save a lot over the dealer. 
If you’ve only been doing minor services up to this point then you have a lot of catching up to do and this will be the deciding factor in your car’s longevity. If you ignore it now the car won’t last. If you do it all and anything else that is found during inspection then you’ll likely get 200k out of it assuming you did the 60k major service also. 
Car maintenance is alot more than oil changes. Especially if you want a car to last a long time.",subaru
I just go to the dealership. Look online to see if your dealership has any coupons for oil change or whatever service you need and it shouldn't be that much more expensive than going to a regular shop. I also trust that if anything goes wrong (like the guy that just posted about them overfilling his engine with oil) the dealership will take care of it and make things right.,subaru

That being said, there is a big difference between a car that sits for days/weeks having low mileage, and cars that regularly drive *very* short distances having low mileage. A car that is short-tripped should be following that date relatively closely, as you're at risk for condensation or fuel dilution in the oil. If on the other hand the car just sits around, but when driven does get up to operating temp and stretches its legs, then maybe you can slide on that date a bit, but no more than 12 months.",subaru

I've replaced quite a few crank sensors in the 2010-2012 Legacys and Outbacks due to the P0335 code. I don't think I've encountered one that needed the harness.

"In general, ""BG"" chemicals can suck a fat one. If you're going to a dealership, the whole point is to get subaru genuine parts, not some aftermarket crap the shop gets kickbacks for.

That being said, 60k miles is the largest required service interval your subaru will have. You can see the maintenance schedule for yourself either by signing in to mysubaru.com, or looking for the ""warranty information"" booklet in your owner's manual where the schedule is printed toward the end. Required services include:

* Oil change
* tire rotation
* Both air filters
* Brake fluid flush
* Spark plugs

Everything else would be listed as ""Inspect and replace as necessary"" which isn't particularly helpful, so:

* Doing your differential fluids *is* a good idea, especially if they've never been done before.
* CVT fluid service is divisive, but if you drive hard or keep a lot of weight in your car, it's not a bad idea.
* The coolant in your car doesn't need servicing until 11 years or 137k miles.
* An "" Air Induction Service,"" assuming it is a top-end cleaner with P.E.A., is a good preventative measure for cars with Direct Injection such as yours. If you're starting to get engine roughness or misfires during the first few seconds of cold start, it may be because carbon build-ups are starting to obstruct air flow in the intake. As such, a top-end cleaner can help remove some of that build-up. If what they're selling is a ""fuel injector cleaner"" that goes in the gas tank, don't bother.

>Front Suspension Control Arm Large & Small Bushings (Both Sides) = 668

Follow the maintenance schedule in the book, if you keep the car past 5/60 then treat any symptoms (walnut blasting intakes) but otherwise don't fall for ""fuel injector servicing"" ""cvt fluid change"" and on and on.

Part of the problem with these cars is they need so little maintenance or service the dealers and repair shops make sh1t up so they can continue to make their boat payments. If it is not misbehaving then follow only what's in the book.

Just farting with a broken rib is agonizing!!,subaru
"**Update:** I figured it out. I feel a little like an idiot, not because it’s something I should’ve found, but because it took me way too long to just go to a shop and say ‘tell me what the hell this noise is’. I did exactly that, and sure enough, loose heat shields on the turbo and uppipe. The turbo shield was easy just to tighten in place, but the uppipe needs to be replaced, so that’s my queue to start beefing up the engine with reliability mods. So whatever the issue was with it having no oil, I have to just assume that I waited too long to get it changed and didn’t check my levels enough. It was a very hot summer where I live, and the car did a lot of commuting after a few years of garage queening during pandemic lockdowns. Guess I got lucky that it didn’t damage the engine in any way. Either way, glad to not be constantly afraid to drive my car now. 

Tossing this one out for any thoughts. I have a mostly stock 2015 STI that's had some strange issues lately. Over the summer I was hearing a rattling sound while coasting, brought it to the dealer and they told me it had almost no oil in the oil pan. Hugely concerning because I change my oil every 2-3k miles, the car did not give me any warnings or indication in the dash, and the oil wasn't leaking as far as I could tell (car is garage kept, my floor was oil free).

The dealer just filled it back up with oil and sent me on my way. No word on why it didn't give me any oil pressure warnings at all. The original sound I was hearing went away, but after that it sounded to me like it was making excess valve noise (louder ticking/clicking noise while running & driving). 

Fast forward to now, I took it to an STI specialist shop, who said the noise wasn't any cause for concern, had an oil sample tested by Blackstone, who noted that nothing looked problematic and that oil filtration was good, and ended up installing an aluminum oil pan and pickup to replace the OEM pickup (this is now the only aftermarket mechanical mod on the car). I also had the spark plugs replaced at that time and a compression test done, which was lower than normal but consistent on all cylinders. About a month after that it sprung a real oil leak, and when I brought it back to the STI specialist, they told me the leak was coming from the oil dipstick tube. They replaced the O rings in the tube, the leak is fixed, and the excess valve noise is lessened to an extent but to my ear is still there.

With all that out of the way, anyone have any idea or leads on what actually happened? My main concern is still the issue that kicked all of this off, the car seemingly losing all of its oil with no leak or signs that it was burning it excessively. I've only driven the car about 5.5k miles per year in the 4 years that I've owned it, it has 55k miles total, so I'm still kind of baffled on that. As for right now, it's not leaking oil and still apparently running well, so I'm taking those as good signs. My only idea after the dipstick tube fix was that it was leaking little by little from the tube over time while I was driving, but not leaking while the car was at rest, until the leak became more severe and was dripping all the time.

Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated.",subaru

"Many brands have certain items checked as lifetime or they don't include it on their maintenance schedule. This gives a false impression and lowers maintenance costs.Reality is that ""lifetime"" is subjective.  We drive very little and our cars might get to 100K in 10 years. So I'm sure I could go without every changing the CVT fluid. No fluid is lifetime and I try to keep my fluids ""fresh"" because of a lot of short trip driving which is probably more wear than highway miles. Brake fluid, coolant, oil, transmission should be replaced regularly either by mileage or by time. The CVT service is also interesting because there is the drain and fill which on the Ascent removes about 5 quarters of fluid, and then there is the flush and fill which removes the full 12-14 quarts or whatever it is. Our dealer only does the drain and fill, but I figure every 30K miles that should be good enough.",subaru

You can find the source of the leak by letting it cool down and clean that whole area real good with a degreaser (like Purple Power or Oil Eater), nylon bristle brush, and then a water rinse. Then turn it on and watch for where the oil starts to appear. Could be a loose oil filter or the oil cooler lines in that area. Both are easy fixes.",subaru

">New car with 200 miles and maintenance feels like a job lol

Why are you changing the oil filter at 200 miles?

Subarus, new Subarus at least, have some of the most reasonable service intervals ever, 5 or 6k on an oil change, 12k cabin, 30 on the air filter, plugs at 60k, 130 on coolant and even tho some people argue different, lifetime on cvt. I'm pretty sure the tco is the least of any car I've owned before. No timing belt, no lifter adjustments, no cap and rotor. Oil filter on top of the engine with a drain tube so your hand doesn't get drenched. 

I'm also pretty sure the oil filter doesn't even get oil to it until after the engine builds pressure. Pretty sure that is common on all new vehicles but especially the Japanese manufacturers. so this ""tip"" is not solving a problem since the problem itself doesn't exist.

AFAIK the reason you'd do this with a rebuilt is because you want the filter catching metal particles before they get to the rest of the motor which should not be the case with an already assembled motor you just drained. I.E. The motor should have already deposited any particles in the previous filter.

Apple CarPlay is terrible about opening / syncing apps when you try and open it ""fresh"" directly from the vehicle screen if it's not an Apple app.

What I mean by that is if you try and open up Apple Maps and navigate to a place?  It'll work just fine.  If you try that with Google Maps?  Chances are good that you'll just see ""sky blue"" screen instead of an actual map.  Same issue with Apple Music vs Spotify.

So good news:  There's nothing wrong with your Subaru.  Bad news, it's not an issue that's likely to be fixed, or if it is fixed, it is outside of Subaru's influence.

The best workaround I've had is either ""prep"" the apps before connecting it to the vehicle by preloading the playlist you want on Spotify (or setting up the destination ahead of time on Google Maps); or if the phone is already connected, go back to the ""home screen"" and swipe Spotify away, then reopen Spotify ON YOUR PHONE.  That's the only consistent ""fix"" I've found for this issue.",subaru

"I may just be pulling this out of my butt, so grain of salt, but based on what I've heard the original 6 speed was designed and built for the STi and the legacy spec.b back in like 2004, so it was overbuilt from the ground up to handle much more torque and power than the 5 speed was. Because commonality is a really good idea from a economy of scale point, this transmission was later adapted for the forester, outback and crosstrek. The crosstrek one might be closer to the 5 speed ( 5MT ) than the 6 speed (SJ), but I'm pretty sure that the forester and outback 6 speed manuals are derived from that original WRX/STi transmission.

The 5 speed is just...cheap. If you have an experience with manuals, you can just kind of tell when you drive them. There's a lot of slop int the gears and shift forks aren't robust, and can easily bend or break off. Synchros go out a lot. You hear a lot of horror stories of these transmissions grenading under regular driving conditions. I unfortunately had that happen to me too in my 2015 Impreza base (completely bone stock, my 3rd gear stripped all of its teeth on the highway and destroyed the rest of the transmission), car only had 85K miles on it and it cost like $3500 to fix.",subaru

"In theory it is using the procedure to have the oil pump direct oil into the dry oil filter to assist with countering an, albeit brief moment, oil starvation condition on startup.  I just fill the filter a couple of times and let the oil wick into the media.  The merits of this all is debatable but for me doing my own PM it makes me feel better taking care of my car. One could also argue that if a car has sat for some time and not been driven using the clear flood to pre-circulate oil is not going to hurt.",subaru

That's assuming the main body components of each haven't been modified at least. I've seen people put the window spoiler on older models that ""aren't supposed to have it"".

Also, my model year ranges are US specific. Looking again, that Bugeye sedan looks like it might possibly be an actual STi, which was never offered here.

"No it doesn’t sound good at all. Also, If you’re looking to buy a BRZ stay away from ones that are wrapped with zero other mods and previously modded suspension. Look how new the hardware on the top hats are, this thing was probably slammed on it nuts the majority of its life. This thing was probably beaten harder than Rhianna. Find one that was owned by a respectable individual. If i saw that wrap on a car for sale id run the other way, but you might be 17, if so I understand.",subaru
"Just curious, but is it a stick or auto?",subaru
"What transmission is in the work cars you've driven? If it's a 4 speed like the one in OP's pic, putting it in 3rd, well, forces it to stay in 3rd instead of upshifting to 4th. Its biggest use would be when you're going downhill and you can compression brake instead of purely using your actual brakes. 

If for some reason it's a very old car and it only has a 3 speed, putting it in 3rd won't stop it from upshifting since it has nowhere to go but as you slow down, it'll hold on to 3rd gear longer before it downshifts to 2nd. There's not really a huge reason to do this but I guess if you were trying to coast as far as possible and didn't want to use neutral, I guess you could force it to stay in its highest gear.",subaru
"Should probably leave the code in history there and take it in anyway. That's about the mileage and age the failure is most common at. I'd err on the side of replacement.

That being said, there is a very recent ECM update available in some models that addresses a false-set of some TCV codes. Unfortunately I'm not finding a corresponding TSB so I can't offer much guidance on that front right now, but if you take it in I'd suggest asking also if there are any ECM updates.",subaru

every 30K-60K miles your differentials front and rear.. this can be done DIY but you must have 4 jackstands and on level ground and it doesn't need to exact. There are videos from MrSubaru1387 on this

CVT fluid drain and fill every 30K-60K miles use Subaru CVTF-II fluid recommend you get a subaru specialist shop to do it... unless you are comfortable doing it since you need something to scan for the fluid temps to do the check fluid at between  95 degrees and 113 degrees.. There are videos from MrSubaru1387 on this. There is no such thing as lifetime fluid that Subaru of America Implies... which means shorter left of your CVT transmission.

&#x200B;

\---- For your car you don't have to deal with hydraulic powersteering....

\------

Brake fluid some say every 2 years.... or you can test your own brake fluid since it does depend on climate: Here's a video from Faye Hadley:

You can test the fluid DIY.... but if you have no experience in changing brake pads and rotors best left the brake fluid changed done by a professional.

\------

Get your spark plugs changed about every 60K miles.... you can try to stretch it to 100K miles but I won't go more than that on a boxer engine... If you get a misfire you know why...

"Seals are designed to work under specific conditions. By overfilling the oil, there is less space in the crank case for vapors so pressure builds and can push oil through seals such as the piston rings.

"[Check Engine Light](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_engine_light)

 This ""telltale"" was established as an industry standard years ago as part of vehicle emissions regulation. It's a warning light that alerts vehicle operators of a fault that causes that vehicle's emissions to be higher than usual. If it's flashing, then your vehicle is actively misfiring, and should not be driven. If it's solid yellow like that, it could be anything from a leaky gas tank or gas cap, to a broken or corroded electrical connector. In that case, the vehicle is probably okay to drive, but it will get terrible fuel economy and should be taken to a repair facility ASAP. 

The OBD2 (On-Board Diagnostics) protocol was established in 1991 and since then, vehicles manufactured worldwide store ""fault codes"" when the check engine light comes on. The codes can be read using a code reader, and allow technicians (or laypeople who do a lot of research, and have a lot of patience) to identify which vehicle component is not functioning properly.

Your Subaru will disable or reduce the functions of stuff like traction control, x-mode, eyesight and other auxiliary systems while it has an active check engine light, just to be safe. That's why you have those other lights on.",subaru
"Find a good independent mechanic who claims to be good at auto electrical work. Replacing the harness is the only way to make it as good as new, which would be fair on a warranty claim but on a 13yo car not much else is as good as new so a well repaired wire or repinned connector is a valid three digit fix.",subaru

"WRX of this era are questionable these days. I own a 2004 WRX myself.

All the mods here are rather normal and mostly from age. Radiators fail around 125k, so that and hoses are fine. The upper coolant tank rusts out over time and he probably did the Mishimoto stuff at the same time. The red turbo inlet is a standard replacement for the OEM unit that rips near the turbo. Stock BOV (looks like a newer one, likely came with the intercooler) with an STI intercooler and new blue connector there.

Only mod that is slightly suspect is the intake, which kinda looks like a K&N Typhoon to me. If it's not tuned, the MAF readings could be off. You'd need a protune for that, not just a Cobb AP OTS map. They claim that one doesn't need a tune, but any intake needs a tune.

Other than that, many WRXs are a bit of a crapshoot and all go back to maintenance and how they were driven by this point. Anytime I can't verify the seller, see gauges, Accessports, intakes, etc I get iffy. It's not that it's poorly modded at all, but it's clearly been tinkered with somewhat, which brings in the question of who installed them and how's the car been driven over the 20 years of it's existence.

If you do go for it, I'd be much more interested in the body and rust. The chassis, subframes, etc. Other things can be fixed and changed with money, but the chassis itself would require a lot more money.",subaru

"When you say 1/3 up the oil dipstick... do you seriously mean several inches? The ""full"" line is like 3"" max from the tip of the dipstick...

Edit: also one thing to note, in most cases, the service advisor is a customer service representative trained to do paperwork, translate technical jargon to the customer, and to some extent deescalate situations. Just because they know the words does not mean they know what they are talking about. Be polite yet firm, and wait for the technicians report. I was a tech and a parts employee; there are good and knowledgeable advisors, but half of the ones I worked alongside couldn't tell the difference between a serp belt and timing chain

Edit 2: to clarify, just because the advisor might not have the correct technical knowledge does not mean they aren't trying. Treat everyone with respect, kindness, all that jazz (until they clearly prove otherwise)",subaru

"I always tell people if you get past the headgaskets, with a potential valve body or torque converter but not guaranteed, I see the most high mileage 10-12 Outbacks and Legacys out there.   That engine is awesome in that it doesn’t have much tendency to use oil like newer models and I have never seen the internals (uncle Rodney knockin) fail like on the mid to late 2000s engines.  The suspension is well put together and they continue to drive well into the 200s and even 300s Ive seen a few.    

I really like gen 2 2000-2004 Outbacks as well.   They have their issues but simple cars that not much costs a ton to fix if you aren’t paying a dealer.  Engines leak but are less prone to rod bearing failure than the VVTs after them",subaru

"I'm guessing a WRX Type RA.  

**Exterior:**  
*  The black mirrors and black door handles are a common indicator of being an RA on a turbo 1st gen 1994+ (1992-1993 did have black door handles on WRX and STi non RA as a caveat)  

* Surprisingly, those aren't the original prefacelift V1 square mirrors, those are the rounded Ver2-Ver6 mirrors so that was swapped too.  

* The trunk sticker indicates WRX not the STi trunk decal, but the spoiler is definitely a ""Ver1"" STi spoiler.   

* The tail light trim also corroborates WRX Type RA, but not sure it's STi still.   

* There is no STi fender badge 


**Interior:** 
* The seats are WRX, not STi V1-V2 seats unless they were swapped.

* The steering wheel was swapped. 

* OEM roll cages were optional accessories, but they were typically black and offered in 6pt or 8pt cages.

**Drivetrain:** 
* The brakes were swapped to GD STi brembos.

Get the list of maintenance intervals and just ask them to do it. At 120k, there should have been a lot more than just oil changes done so far. Coolant should have been changed at least once with the new blue super coolant, spark plugs at least once, CVT fluid a few times, rear diff fluid a few times, PVC valve, brake fluid, etc.

If you're so inclined, a lot of the fluid changes are rather simple. Takes a simple socket set and a jack, or maybe a special funnel or something.",subaru

You sucked up air, so you need to bleed the entire system and not just refill it. You'll have air pockets floating around in the block, leading to hot spots.

Preventive maintenance is never a bad thing and Subarus do seem to love being loved. 

The dealer telling you to service the CVT may just have your best interests at heart.

The TSB says *""A DCM successfully moved to Factory Mode will have the Green Telematics LED illuminated whenever the key is on. This Green indicator LED does not indicate a valid subscription, it indicates a non-comm checked DCM in Factory Mode. DO NOT perform a comm check to a DCM in Factory Mode.""*

Does that mean I should see a green light lit up on my overhead button panel when I start the car if the dealer corrects my DCM parasitic draw by setting the DCM to Factory Mode?  Below is a picture of my Crosstrek overhead red/blue buttons. Is that where the green light would be?

Yes, you have to cut zip ties to remove them also, but it's not the same. The metal bands required shoving a screwdriver under the crimped area to loosen it a bit, then shove some dikes into the pulled up bit, then wiggle and pull and curse until your face is red, then maybe it's loose and thin enough to get a grip onto it and cut it and pry it loose.

At least this explains why all this time it's been occurring, but very irritating because I've had to keep a jump module in the car to use almost every time I want to start it the past year.

The letter didn't say anything about the bypass (which I would VERY much prefer), only that they can upgrade it and cover previous expenses as part of it.

So you're saying they can put in a bypass at no charge? This would very much make me happy, because the letter doesn't say anything other than updating the DCM to 4G.",subaru

">lingering 100k head gasket issues

Not an issue unless you royally abuse your car.  Hasn't been for over a decade. 

And you very much overpaid for the warranty if you spent $3k.  The 10/100/0 should be in the low $2ks (2100-2400 give or take).

Check your car's in service date before cancelling.  You can only re-buy the warranty if the car is less than 3 yrs old and under 36k miles.  If you meet those requirements, then yes you can cancel and re-buy.  You have at least 30 days for a full refund, I think it's actually 90 days but I'd have to go look it up and I'm too lazy to do that.  After that period, you can still cancel but the refund would be prorated and there is a small processing fee.  

You can buy it from other dealers, and it is very negotiable.  You usually can't buy from far away out of state dealers, it's supposed to be within your region and most dealers do stick to that.  Region is not well defined, but generally in state and close bordering states is ok.",subaru

"YW.

It's possible it may be completely unrelated to the oil change service and just coincidental and may be claimed/fixed under warranty.

If not...

Regardless of whether it was over-fill or underfill, they are probably evaluating it(and may even have a machine shop/engine rebuild guy look at it) to see if it may be salvageable by fixing any broken parts/gaskets, etc.) without giving you a whole new engine. So if it was their fault, you may not get a new engine if they can fix it for less than new.

Otherwise they may possibly replace the engine with a new or reman engine.

They may do try to do this under warranty.
The manufacturer may approve the repair or may deny the repair(if they think it was not a defect)... 

So just be prepared for manufacturer pushback.  At that point the dealership may either fix it at their cost or place the blame on the customer. That's when it gets difficult. You can always complain to the manufacturer but the manufacturer may let you and the dealer dispute at-fault. I've had this happen before where the manufacturer(not Subaru) wouldn't get involved, even sent a nice denial letter.

The dealer may then blame you.  Why didn't you check the oil?  Why didn't you stop the car when you saw the oil light and stop engine light ?  How did you not see the warning lights? Why didn't you stop when you heard engine noises? 

At that point, you may need to decide whether it's worth it to get a lawyer or just go get a low mileage salvage engine and have a local mechanic install it for you.  

 Hopefully it works out and gets repaired/replaced by dealer/manufacturer at their cost.  If not, you could always have a free consult with lawyer to see if worth a lawsuit.

"Subarus use a huge amount of common parts, so you're better off searching by era or model year rather than specific models.

I would say based on my own research and experience (I've owned, or my family has owned 6 subarus now), anything in roughly the 2008-2012ish model years that is naturally aspirated and does not have on of the early CVTs or the 5 speed manual. 6 speed manual and the 4-5EAT are both pretty robust.

Reason why is because this is when they started moving to the FB engine, and before CVTs were the standard. The EJ is an objectively bad engine that Subaru got hit with several class actions over, and all of the head gasket and leaking coolant and overheating issues that Subarus are known for is due to this engine design. The FB is redesigned to eliminate a lot of these problems and as a bonus uses timing chains instead of belts, which is one major repair you wouldn't have to do, and while CVTs have gotten loads better, Subaru hasn't quite figured out keep theirs from occasionally eating themselves after 60,000 miles or so. Many will make it a long time, but enough of them just randomly die that I still feel weird buying one. Just feels like i have a $4,000 time bomb strapped to the bottom of my car.

Something that is worth noting is that while Subaru isn't the worst in this regard, they're not particularly reliable compared to other automakers. That doesn't mean I don't love these cars (read: I've owned or had a stake in 6 of them) but reliability is not their selling point.",subaru

"Well our 17 outback limited vs 2017 WRX premium has the outback winning for reliability. 

WRX oil pan was replaced at 3k because it somehow had a cross threaded drain plug. It blew air conditioning O-Rings at 27k miles, has a constant rattle since 15k (pretty sure bolt is loose up in map light/sun roof’s control area but so far husband doesn’t want me to dig around a find it), and the big one was head gasket and clutch throw out were done at 57k. 

It’s been babied the entire time and nope, still had issues. During the head gasket fix, I brought it in for the oil control solenoids and an oil pressure light that kept activating and they replaced the next day. While there, they noted the head gasket was leaking from the back side and ordered parts. Never told us and then I got called a week later with “good news! Parts are in and we just need the car for a day or two.” When pressed for what was wrong, they told me a valve cover was leaking. A week after its appointment I called and asked when it would be done since 1-2 days turned into 3-5 where at least the shell was visibly parked outside. At 6th business day got ahold of them for updated timeline. Dude tells me that it was currently in 3 pieces. We had to clarify that yes it was our WRX where shell was in one bay have a suspension component looked at while engine and transmission each had their own bay and work being done. Was about 5 minutes of “are you sure it’s ours?” And finally had him read the plate off it since we obviously didnt have the full info. Told them ok, well call me when it’s in 1 piece instead of 3 then. Never told us before it was the head gasket. I was told initially it was a valve cover that was slightly seeping. Nope it was cam seal seeping along with head so it got all new gaskets and seals plus a new clutch and throw out. Parts were almost 8k by itself. Thank god for the gold warranty. 

Outback broke its front cat bellows at 94k and muffler has a soft spot on it that makes a rattling sound. They did a rear wheel hub and suspension bushings that were noisy around 95k miles. The mirror link head unit got replaced 3 times under warranty but still occasionally acts up.",subaru

"Insurance adjuster here, I’m 50/50 on it without a proper teardown and running a value on your vehicle but let me address a few things. First you drive a unibody vehicle this means the entire body of your car IS the frame, so the portion in the front called the core support (where your radiator/fan assembly and condenser sit) is built to be replaced without any loss of structural integrity. The full extent of the damages won’t be known until the front end is completely disassembled but there is nothing visible in these pictures that would be a cause of concern if repaired by a competent shop. The only reason that anyone can see in these pictures that your vehicle would be considered a total is if the repairs cost more than the actual value of the vehicle. Your next steps will be to have an adjuster look at it and write an estimate either at your home, via photos or by taking it to a shop that’s contracted with your insurance company. Once the complete estimate is put together, the software that they use (CCC, Mitchell or Audatex) will give them a certain percentage by doing a round calculated guess, as to how far into a potential total loss you may be. For my company once it hits 70% we will run a value on your vehicle. If it doesn’t hit that particular threshold they won’t even run the value and it will just be fixed. If they DO run a value understand it’s NOT your insurance company that actually determines the value, it’s the third party estimating software that’s used that will do that. Once they get the actual value of YOUR vehicle back it’s simply a matter of which is cheaper for the insurance company, pay you out or fix it. Also depending on your state and your company that percentage may (likely won’t) be 100%, most companies I write for are at the 70-75% mark then it becomes a total loss. Good luck and feel free to DM me if you have any questions.",subaru
Thank you for this insight that’s awesome! It does have manual windows as well as an intercooler sprayer. It has an sti branded exhaust as well. A friend of mine had pointed out it’s possibly it was a pro/group a rally car from the era mostly because it has STi accessories but no sti branding on the chassis. Besides rocker damage and chassis bracing all the way around I don’t know what else to look for. The oe cage is black and is a 6 pt. With that being said. Is it worth it to restore to its former glory or did I get baited. I only paid 8000 for it non running but all it needed was a fuel pump and that was easy. And how rare are these? I can find the original brochure for it and that is it seems like a semi lost chassis.,subaru

"All the automakers want to move to the Tesla DTC model - but NADA is a bitch and a powerful dealership lobby. And dealership chains, especially in North Carolina(home to Hendrick and Sonic Automotive who IMO are just there to finance their NASCAR or race track operations), Florida(AutoNation), and Texas wield a lot of political power. I’d call the internet department, then find a different dealership or use a car buying service from a credit union or Cartelligent. The reasons why dealerships are scummy is the F&I office’s products are high margin(extended warranties, paint & fab, alarms), floorplanning loans aren’t cheap and the sales tower has a motive to sell the oldest car first because of that, and it’s a game between sales managers and their subordinates to sell the most and get their spiff.",subaru

"The issue with that argument is, a VIN does not specifically mean it follows ISO3779/3780. The definition of a VIN is, quite like it says, just a number that identifies the vehicle. They were called VINs for decades before they became 17 digits in the USDM.

This car would fall under the era of ISO3779:1983 and ISO3780:1983. The problem with that is, Japan agreed to the standard for export vehicles only. Vehicles meant to stay in Japan used Japan's own internal VIN requirements. At the time of the GC/GM/GF cars, Japan only required a chassis identifier, engine identifier, and production number identifier. They did not require a WMI, plant number, etc. because the unique VIN meant that it was made in Japan at the only plant in Japan. Japan used this VIN system long before ISO3779/3780 came about.",subaru

"For our US friends like myself, this is $5800 USD and 119k miles.

It's a bit rough for my taste. Big ding/dent on the rear hatch. Rear fender rust. Certainly rust underneath. If it was mostly pristine, these go for about $10-15k USD here in the US... about 3x what this one is going for. Again, in great condition, no rust, about the same miles.

The good news is it's mostly stock. Radiator was replaced because they leak with age. He just upgraded it and didn't put a plastic end tank one back in. Everything else is stock it appears.

Here's my take - if you do buy it, plan on getting that rust taken care of before it spreads. I'd be getting the rear fenders done, sanding off any surface rust underneath, then painting with some type of rust coating (POR15, etc)... THEN Fluid Filming on top. Probably the cheapest way to keep it from spreading.

I don't think the price is terrible given the mileage, being stock, it's a turbo XT version, etc. Just be careful and have a bit of $$$ saved up for repairs. It is a 20 year old turbo Subaru at this stage.",subaru

I kept getting mailers for me to trade in (upgrade they call it) my 2020 Outback for a new model at a marginal increase in monthly payment (like $350/mo to $380/mon). Looking at the fine print they were giving a trade-in value of like $16k when I could have sold it on the open market easily for like $22-23k.

$599/month seems absolutely insane to me unless you are putting like no money down or are getting a top trim or terrible credit or something. Should be easy enough to shop around lease pricing and see. Base model Outback leasing at a dealership near me is advertised at $305/month with $3k down.

Copied from another Car thread.

 

It will not give you increased MPG and I’ve had a lot of experience with BG products. I worked for a Subaru dealer in which the sales rep for BG came around and convinced the service manager these products (while good) are the end-all for any car.

This led to every car coming into the shop getting BG engine oil additive, fuel system additive, transmission additive, etc. Will they hurt? No. Will they make a noticeable difference in any area? No.  
They also provided a mechanic incentive inside the cans by inserting a plastic tab which could be saved and turned in, a la returnable bottles, for a reimbursement.

I tried BG in my work car (150+ miles a day commute) just for hoots and it did zero, zilch, and nada. The only thing I could find that BG made a noticeable difference in is when I added a small quantity of BG engine oil treatment to the transmission and hydraulic front fork on my Harley Davidson shovelhead motorcycle. It did improve the trans clunkiness (which is normal on these) and improved the front fork ride. Other than that, save your money.",subaru

And while the traffic is like 35% of LA's traffic (I know it gets bad, but not LA bad) I had the hardest time learning the city and all of the quirks of the roadways. The city was absolutely not designed for a car based society. The freeways just kind of stop or start at random points (like golden hill area) and they have random exits that people zoom across all lanes (the 8 east to the 15 north, 8 west past the 5 to get to PB)

What maintenance are they recommending for $1300?  Can be reasonable depending on what it is they are doing. Brakes at that price Id do myself.

"With an EJ20 you are not getting much past 350 and staying in the reliable realm without internal mods. If it's a USDM EJ205, however an EJ207 with V8 heads can get up around 400. To get to the 650 you are talking about with a EJ20 takes a fair bit of money.

Now if you are in the US and your car is a 2004 STi, it will have an EJ25 stock not the 20. Unless it's swapped for some reason. That can go to around 400hp as well, but eventually you are gonna run into issues.

The best route is to get a turbo back exhaust, upgrade the intake and intercooler, get some 1200cc injectors and then get Dyno tuned on an E50 mix. This will give you a good HP bump and not be hard on the wallet.

Do t neglect maintenance items....it's not a Honda or Toyota",subaru

"I had no idea a dealership would do that. I was in similar boat with my 2019 Impreza -very low mileage over the first 3 years and Covid sparking car values.I decided to buy the lease [out.At](http://out.At) end of lease time inventory was very low and I felt like I would have had no negotiating power.  
Anyways this is what I do-YMMV.First I live in rural [Vermont.One](http://Vermont.One) local dealer -2 dealers within a 60 minute drive.Couple other dealers even further [away.In](http://away.In) my case I decided I just wanted to deal with three-probably could have done even better if I wanted to go further-I've heard of people saving enough money to get on an airplane and pick up their car in Chicago or some such but that's too much work(for me).  
You have to know the cars and the add ons.Basically I go to subaru .com and build the car I want-exactly.Then I email the car specs to each dealership-asking for a quote on the lease I want with the amount of down payment I want(zero). I tell them it's one shot.I know alot of people like to play one dealer off another but I'm just not that into it so one shot it is.  
Also I don't do tradeins because that means (generally) you have to bring the trade in to the dealer for inspection and I'm trying to save time and aggravation.It's not that hard to sell a car you own(not lease).  
The first time I did this my local dealer asked me the winning bid.When I told them they accused me of lying.haha. I still get the stink eye from some of them(I occasionally use their service dept).  
So this probably would not work for you although building a car on the website I think will teach you quite a bit about how options are packaged etc. Whatever you do I would talk to more than one dealership. Good luck!",subaru

"**Change just one tire or two?** How badly mismatched are 195/60/15 vs 185/65/15?

1999 impreza wagon, 1.5(?) 1.8(?) no turbo absolute poverty spec (5 MT awd with hi/low lever but always awd, window cranks, no ABS, no central locking, manual mirrors, Drum brakes in the back and tiny discs up front. There is  power steering, heated seats and airbags. Light grey cloth upholstery and many blanking plugs on the dash. Not much engine power. The trunk lid only says ""impreza awd"" nothing else. Its blue metallic with no spoilers or wheelarch flares. The places för foglights are banked off with black plastic, but it has two tiny ""Hella"" highbeams on top of the front bumper, painted in the same color as the car - could have been factory or dealer mounted?). I have the privilege of dailying this gem for a month as a a loaner and yesterday I had a flat tire. 

In the falling snow slush. 

With a freezer loaded in the back with back seats down - because why not? (Hello murphy). 

It is a pinch hole in the sidewall and can't be plugged. 

Luckily there was a jack and wrench, so after unloading the freezer and all other stuff (middle of moving homes) to access the sparewheel, the car is now standing on a narrow emergency donut and got us home, carefully, about 7km. I imagined i can hear a rattle from under the gearstick when driving on the donut (front right) at about 40-50 kph when coasting - is this the mid diff locking and unlocking quickly?  

**I can absolutely not afford four tires, really not even one**. The three left have a good amount of tread probably half worn. They are pretty soft studless friction winter tires). There's 500km of highway between me and where the car belongs, and it is unlikely it will get all new tires anytime soon even after I leave it, but also it normally isnt driven much at all, probably less than 5000km in a year, it's my old dad's hunting car so it mainly goes on gravel locally  in the summer. Probably that's why i got a flat in the first place, I think the nokias are drying / dying of age, and didnt like highway speeds that they werent used to.

Thing is **I happen to have two old tyres (from an old volvo) already off rim in the shed, can they be used?** On the car is nokian 195/60/15 XL weight rating 92H, and in the shed I have two (very old) kumho i'zen 185/65/15 weight rating 88T with a fair bit of tread left. No visible dry rot, at least theyve been stored inside. How bad would it be to slap these on for a while? Calculated rolling circumference from theoretical dimensions alone is less than 1% . Is this car old enough to not care since it lacks ABS, or is it even MORE picky with ""visco diffs""?  Are they even visco diffs?  is any diff an open diff? How do I tell when driving if the diffs are struggling/activating?

a: nope, better do 500 km on the emergency donut and then buy a new tire of same make and model.

b: put one 185/65 on in the front and just drive

C put one 185/65 on in the back for less affecting stability when braking

c: put two 185/65 on:

C1: up front  - front axle rolling faster ( thinking it may trigger the center diff? but predictable understeer in braking)

C2: in the back - rear axle rolling faster (center diff suffers, less affect on steering/stablility?)

C3: two 185/65/15 -88 diagonally - even out the front/back axle speed difference but let the axle diffs work (are they open diffs even)?

  
Balancing diff wear with driving feeling:

weaker up front - sluggish steer response?

Weaker in the back - risk of fishtailing?

Do I put more air in the weaker tyres?

Have a 2002 legacy l ej251 motor. Just found out it has a leaking head gasket. Dealership and myself have both been monitoring it but is there any immediate concern? 140xxxkm hardly ever abused but has 2002 head gasket. Obviously dealer won’t do anything until it blows. But is it worth it to replace when it gets pretty bad or wait till it blows. Also looking for a good exhaust kit for my wagon.

"Ok, here's the details.  Top Tier uses the ASTM D6201 test to determine detergent levels.  The first test uses base fuel with out additive, the intake valve deposits (IVDs) have to be greater than 500 mg if my memory is correct (I worked in the industry from 2008 to 2019).  The combustion chamber deposits or CCDS (both the cylinder head and piston top deposits) are also scraped and weighed.

The 2nd test uses the same base fuel with the additive.  The IVDs has to be less than 50 mg (again - may memory is hazy on the exact amount).  The CCDs are allowed to be 140% of the base fuel run.  Every detergent package I tested has CCD's over 100% as compared to base fuel.  This included both PIBA and PEA based additives.

Now, what gets crazier is the treat rates some companies use.  The treat rate for the main additive package where I worked was around 25 ptb (pounds per thousand barrels) for the EPA LAC (Lowest allowable concentration).  The EPA LAC uses the ASTM D5500 so it's a different test than Top Tier.  The treat rate for Top Tier for the same package was around 60 ptb.  However, some companies would buy that additive package and treat their fuel at 150 ptb, which is allowed per Top Tier rules.  These high treat rates, when used extensively and the car is mildly driven, could lead to high combustion chamber deposits.  This is why I avoid BP and Shell stations as they treat well above the 60 ptb.  I normally just buy LAC fuel for this reason.  Or I get Citgo as they only treat at the 60 ptb.

edit:  The base fuel has to create 500 mgs of IVD per valve (I thought it was 100 but it's 500).",subaru

In my 22s manual it states conditions that contribute to consumption. One of those is engine braking. You have a manual so…….you do that? Down shift instead of applying brakes?  I’ve had MT in the past and did that routinely.

The Subaru WRX STI is a trim level for the Subaru WRX. The main difference between the two is performance. The WRX is designed for high-powered daily driving, while the STI is more focused on track capability. 
Here are some other differences between the 1995 Impreza WRX and the 1995 WRX STI:
Performance: The STI has a bigger engine, stiffer springs, thicker tires, and more powerful brakes. The STI also has a top speed of 174 mph, compared to the WRX's 159 mph.
Visual differences: The STI has STI badges on the grill and in the back, bigger wheels and breaks, and a distinctive rear diffuser.
Resale value: The STI holds value better than the WRX.
Fuel economy: The WRX gets acceptable highway mileage, while the STI doesn't.",subaru

Usually I have a jug with some leftover spent oil from a previous change, or some useless small amount of unused new oil, that I pour the old oil into and dispose of. And sine this car is new, doesn't leak, and doesn't seem to be burning oil in the exhaust, I've never had a good reason to check how much oil came out. Anyways, in went 4.7qt for my 2L model, and this is what came out… about 3.2 qt. Or a loss of about 1.5 qt (obviously a small amount is left in the old filter and in the container I caught the spent oil in, but that amount is fairly negligible). 

So I'm down ~1.5qt in ~4500 mi, which seems like a lot. I have always used 0W-20 full synthetic and oem filters with a new drain plug washer. I’ll also add that I drive conservatively, typically shifting at around 3k rpm. Exhaust color and smell are typical and I don’t detect any burning oil. And no leaks.

"Swift Sport FXT springs gets you there.  It actually rides better than stock too because stock is a bit too...tall, think pogostick as in you often lift a tire over uneven terrain.  The Swift springs drop it down more towards middle of the suspension travel range so it can go up and down and not lift a tire.

[https://www.maperformance.com/products/swift-sport-springs-subaru-forester-xt-2004-2008](https://www.maperformance.com/products/swift-sport-springs-subaru-forester-xt-2004-2008)

Another thing that's nice to do is up the rear sway bar a little.  This just knocks out some understeer and reduces a little body roll to boot.  Do you want to do this?  That's up to you.

Now, thicker sway bars tends to load up the mounting points a bit, so if you go too big, you can start breaking stuff not meant for the stiffness.  20mm and under, you don't have to change anything, but you can anyways if you want, so this is nice to get when upgrading the rear sway bar.

[https://www.maperformance.com/products/rear-sway-bar-brace-brackets-and-bushings-20mm-kbr18-20](https://www.maperformance.com/products/rear-sway-bar-brace-brackets-and-bushings-20mm-kbr18-20)

For the 20mm sway bar:

[https://www.subaruonlineparts.com/sku/20451va000-20464va000-x2.html](https://www.subaruonlineparts.com/sku/20451va000-20464va000-x2.html)

(their fitment years stops at 2009, but it fits older)

A caveat about sway bars.  Sway bars are springs that are not damped.  They are added spring force side to side that is not well controlled because the main dampers are only tuned for the main springs.  So...big sway bars are a lot of spring force with no control.  You never want to go too big unless you have a different style of damper with AGGRESSIVE low speed damping.  This is not stock damping.  This is not AGX struts, not Tokico struts, not even Koni Yellow inserts.  You kind of need to get to serious race level damping to get really aggressive low speed damping to control big swaybars well.  And when I say aggressive I mean skip your car off the road like a stone skipping on water aggressive.

So with this said, what I liked best with my Forester for a stock ride setup was stock struts, Swift Sport Forester XT springs, and an upgraded 20mm rear sway bar.  This is a really nice, really comfy setup, that also handles pretty near neutral too.

I would also not look at changing the struts away from stock.  No KYB, no Tokico, no Koni inserts.  Anything else is going to lose you travel and lose you comfort, and there's no specific gain elsewhere on anything near stock spring rates.  KYB GR2 and AGX are only stock profiles meaning you don't really gain anything unless you want +15% damping.  A GR2 rear upgrade might be of interest, maybe.  I liked Tokico's D-Spec struts, worked great up to 350lb/in rates (front), but they're only useful if you're actually planning to go stiff and need the adjustment.  On soft springs, they're going to feel quite near the AGX setup anyways just with a slightly harsher bump impact.  There's not enough to gain.  Plus you can't fit as big of tires with its lower positioned rear spring perch.

There's actually some nice coilovers from Feal, Fortune Auto, and Stance if you want to go that route, but many are relatively firm for spring rates, although you can spec lower rates if you want.  Fortune Auto and Feal have a max of 6"" of stroke on their setups which isn't bad at all, but stock struts have more total stroke.  And it's not worth doing unless you're trying to go stiffer.

I've run a lot of setups on my Forester over the many years I've owned it.  I've dailied it, raced it in autocross and rallycross, and I have a solid idea of what's good for these cars.  For a better than stock stock ride, Swift Sport Forester XT springs + 20mm rear swaybar IS the best setup.  It rides better and handles better than stock.  If you want, you could technically run a GR2 rear strut (also called Excel-G, rear struts are parts 334344 and 334345, sold various places individual or as a pair), but there's no specific need.",subaru

"100% Agree, I've tried the Costco Auto buying and every time the dealer adds on so much (and won't negotiate it) that their price is much higher than what I end up buying the vehicle from without them.

The Costco deal is that it's say $x below MSRP, but on some models, it's not even that (they price it model to model and by each region), it can be MSRP. And there's nothing on the add-ons, so the dealers use that to make up the difference.

I have had luck with Sam's Club, but it's just Truecar, they just throw in some perks on top. But I think it was more that the end dealer was just a better dealer (small town outside a big metro area, Family owned dealership). Was able to test-drive and buy the car is under an hour.",subaru

"2005 is a weird year for Subarus. There were major changes to just about every system in 2005 for emissions and 2006 to meet the new safety regulations in America. The 2004 and before occupancy sensors were just a basic on/off light with an airbag that shoots. The 2006 and later are a full digital system that monitors a bunch of stuff in accordance with the government, seat position, vehicle direction, and speed for example.


2004/5 was Subarus own ""generational update"" time, then the US said ""get safer"" late in the update cycle so Subaru had to update AGAIN in 2006. Subaru also only updates things when the parts bin runs out not at a specific date so a car produced one month later than yours can have a completely different wiring system in 2004/5/6. I've drivetrain swapped a few of these.....",subaru

"Don’t use any more additive and don’t buy Top tier fuel for a while. Most additives will actually increase combustion chamber deposits. If it were mine, I’d take it on the highway for 30 minutes or so, get it nice and warmed up. Then run it at wide open throttle up a long hill or on ramp several times.  That will help break up any deposits.  If it’s caused by combustion chamber deposits or CCDs (which is my guess) there’s not much you can do other than run it hard every now and then to break up the deposits. There aren’t any fuel additives that will help with CCDs.",subaru

"Happens all over the automotive industry. Manufacturers set MSRP but selling at this rate is not enforced. The MSRP margins are set by the manufacturer based on if it is a fast moving part (wipers, oil filters, etc), slower moving (brake, suspension etc), major component (engines, transmissions differentials), body parts and so on. Some dealers sell at a matrix pricing which is basically cost + a percentage markup for all parts based on everything regardless of part category.

Shop between dealers is your best bet to get the OEM part at the MSRP price.",subaru

I used to camp in my '97 outback all the time as a teenager. I lived in my 02 WRX hatch for about a month. Both can fit a twin mattress in the back (though the hatch was admittedly cramped).

"Recently bought a pre-owned 2021 Subaru Crosstrek Sport. After the painstakingly-long process of setting up the MySubaru app (transfer of ownership), nothing works.

(They said a green should be illuminated). I'm also unable to update the head unit, as it fails every time. 

Does this seem like a fried DCM or something easy? I searched through different threads only to find stuff on Outbacks and Legacys.",subaru
"I am quite familiar with ""Motel Subaru"" and long commutes. 

&#x200B;

The setups I know have a winter overnight setup (and a summer overnight setup) at all times. This includes sleeping bag, some blankets, some non-perishable food (keep that in a separate box you can carry away if you need; in my region there is some risk of pests and if the food is carried away you lessen the risk of unwelcome visitors) - and some various other overnight / emergency supplies (for example, ""10 essentials for camping""). If you also transport animals be sure you pack for their care and sheltering as well. 

&#x200B;

As far as packing and sleeping - I've seen various configurations depending on safety / exit levels for plans. I've known folks who sleep in the back of the rig on folded seats, often with some type of camping pad. (Hint: If you transport animals, or just need a cheap start - look into dog beds with closed cell foam.) I've known folks who prefer to sleep in the seats with a blanket over the top of them, or do so out of semi-necessity to allow multiple animals enough space to shelter overnight when roads weren't good and the car was shelter of necessity. 

&#x200B;

Highly recommend planning for the night / temps and taking extra stuff as needed. This includes a change of warm clothes just in case your clothes get wet (I know someone who fell in a 55 gallon barrel of water on the coldest day of the year at their job...then had to overnight in their Subaru. Thankfully, they stripped the wet clothes and changed into dry ones before the night started!) Also take extra shoes just in case you need to walk out of someplace or your shoes have an incident. 

&#x200B;

Depending on temps and setup preferences, I've seen ""down to 24-26 degrees F (about -4 C)"" overnighting in the driver's seat (tipped back), covered with about 3-4 double fleece blankets,  and wearing warm clothes and hat"" with minimal issues; woke up slightly cold and had to take some trips inside to walk around a bit, but did okay. Apparently this person also had a sleeping bag, but had difficulty washing it (and fleece blankets were easier / cheaper to wash) so opted to do it that way. 

&#x200B;

Also helpful: Consider carrying toe/hand warmers; it is also helpful (despite the cold) to put at least a couple windows down about half or 3/4 inch (about 2-3 cm) as this will minimize the condensation build up and make you feel warmer. 

&#x200B;

And as far as the CO2; agree with the others; as long as the vehicle isn't running, this risk is minimized. Now, if you are at a rest stop or in a parking garage with other folks, having a battery operated one is likely a very good thing. But as far as the occasional overnight from folks I've known about, they're either camped out enough other folks aren't a concern, and/or they are in large parking lots where there's still enough ventilation (or in some type of parking garage where they've rolled their windows up for other reasons and just deal with the condensation in the morning). 

&#x200B;

Good luck and have fun!",subaru
"It's not all doom and gloom, more just managing expectations - Just make sure you're prepared to stay on top of more things. Check the CV joints, flush your trans and diffs regularly, rotate your tires every 5k miles and stay on top of oil changes and you'll probably be just fine. They don't have a Toyota's capacity for abuse or neglect though. My brother's camry is pushing 300K miles and he regularly forgets to put oil in it for a few days, and the engine mounts haven't actually been attached to the car for months now. That thing still somehow runs and drives through some divine intervention. If you do that to a Subaru they're going to break and break fast.

Subarus really are great cars, they're extremely sure footed and capable, i like the driving dynamics and balanced smoothness from the weight distribution of the engine, uncommonly safe in accidents. They just take a little extra love, so if you know that going in it'll be a great car.",subaru

He knew all I wanted was to come in and look at the two interior options, outside paint options, and test drive a model to finalize my decision and decide on any additional options like dealer installed hitch for a bike rack, cargo net, etc.   Already had a good idea of the price I was going to get and pay from online shopping and talking to the sales guy earlier in the week.   Went into the dealer in the afternoon and he was busy and passed me off to another guy.   Went downhill from there. Could not get a straight answer about if they had specific colors to look at and in the end all I got to see was a white one with black interior.   I did get kind of a test drive, but afternoon traffic was already stacking up, so was really pointless.

I know there’s stuff in this elusive manual that applies to my trim (premium) based on what the main Owner’s Manual says is in there. I even told the vehicle resources page that I had a different trim just to see if that would make this extra PDF show up, but it doesn’t.

"Definitely check your 02 sensors first. The secondary one towards the end of the car is cheap to replace. It’s right next to the transmission. The first one closer towards the engine cost me 200 bucks from Advanced. I think they’re both DEMCO branded.

It’s been a great run, but I was looking for something a bit easier.  Don’t get me wrong: the turbo on the 24 Wilderness still hits 0-60 in ~6s, so plenty of power.

"I took my 2018 Crosstrek to dealer service today to check out the DCM under the new extended warranty.  This is what they said:

1) They did a software update check on the DCM system and said that the response shown was that there was no update applicable to my VIN.

2) They did a draw test of about 20 minutes. During that time a draw of 10-25mA was observed, well below the 70mA threshold of concern.

Their conclusion, my particular Crosstrek is not experiencing DCM parasitic draw.

I did have a pressure situation recently from Toyota Dealer though,  I went to the Toyota dealer to check out a v6 Camry (I try to keep my cars for 10+ years, so I might as well look at everything)  I texted them  a few days before, made an a appointment  aND I drove 1 hour each way to the dealership.  I got there, we ran some numbers, I was fine with the price, they were only adding dealer doc fee, no BS adds ons.  I had told him up front that I was going to Subaru dealership on Saturday and I wasn't buying that day (this was Wednesday). They however wouldn't let me test drive the Camry without a purchase and sales agreement and a $500 deposit.  I could sit in the car and start the motor that was it. (I am a 50 year old adult)  I spent 3.5 hours to and from. I didn't have a chance to test drive it and figure out if this something I wanted.  I went to Subaru dealer, I was happy on the 2 test drives and made a deal. (I actually told the Subaru dealership I wasn't buying that day either, but the test drive, low pressure sale and reasonable pricing convinced me) The Toyota salesman called me on Monday to see if I was still interested, I told him I made deal for a Subaru on Saturday. He fired back that I wasn't serious, as most people don't cross shop V6 Camry with Legacy's. No point in arguing with him, but the deal was dead when I drove the Legacy Sport.",subaru

I always just the screen though, the 11in display is enough. Coming from an old Subaru CVT transmission, I was accustomed to the shifting. It is a delayed response, but can be mitigated if you maintain RPMS in relation to speed.

I ended up going with a dealership where the rep told me flat out “hey man I want you to buy this car because what you’re driving is kind of a shitcan (it was). But if you don’t, someone else will in 2 weeks. Here’s my card, give me a call when you decide”

Make sure to turn the wheels full lock both ways as well as keeping in mind the suspension can compress several inches while checking for clearance.

I had the exact same issue bending wheels. I'm currently up to a 45 ratio from 40s, and I am going to try to go to 50s next for extra sidewall.
  
The tire doesn't need to stretch. Check the rim width range listed on the tire specs. A nice square sidewall that slightly hangs out past the rim will protect the wheel more. A 215/45 may not have much more sidewall than a 225/40.

The two Subaru dealerships I've bought from since early 2000s have given me great buying experiences.  Very low pressure and easy deals in my desired price range.  We have only gotten the trim and options we wanted over four new car purchases.  My sister took our cue and bought a new car from one of those dealerships and had a similar experience.

Now that I'm shopping for EVs, working with **other** brands has been a reminder that not everyone is a straightforward, easy seller.  My local VW dealership has been OK thus far from a deal standpoint for their existing inventory, but their communications on new-year model pricing leave something to be desired while I wait for my reserved configuration to ship.  Subaru gave me all the pricing up-front, there were no questions.  I waited five months and got exactly what we agreed upon.

Other VW dealers in the area had arrogant as fuck Sales Managers.  Tesla's Sales Reps who contacted me after some test drives literally lied about out-the-door cost on a deal that they steered me towards.  And so forth.",subaru

"I’m really surprised that they didn’t extend the warranty for those few problematic CVT years. They did this back in the mid 2000s when there was a known issue with converters. If I recall, they pushed it out to ~145k. 

I’m not saying that you didn’t try hard enough, but if you live in an area where there is more than one dealership, it would’ve been a good idea to visit all of them and see if one would really go to bat for you. With your maintenance records I’m shocked that Subaru wouldn’t help out at all. 

So here’s an anecdotal story about Subaru really doing things right. ~20 years ago when my old 2004 Outback’s diff went, it went catastrophically bad due to salty ass snow being jammed so tightly up under the skid plate that it ate the bottom end out of the rear diff. Since I had a pay-per-month carwash membership, I was able to obtain a record of my weekly (if not more) washes and that an undercarriage wash was included in my plan. SOA bought me a new rear end and advised the dealer to drill some drain holes when they reinstalled the rear skid plate. 

SOA needs to return to being that SOA.",subaru

"I'm from the northwest, so rural areas as well as old cities are my familiarity. I moved to Orange County and then LA and did just fine adapting to the driving there. The cities are grid system for the most part, rural areas have curvy roads to dodge hills, private property, and other features. I participate in ""spirited mountain driving"" in scarcely populated areas as well, so I'm used to all sorts of conditions. 

San Diego has had development around its hills and valleys, and the infrastructure has to navigate that. Add in the locals growing up driving these roads and they know the quirks and intricacies that are abundant here, which seem to be twice as much as a place like LA. With cars that can accelerate and stop so quickly, the folks that are comfortable are brazen on the roads and the people that are unfamiliar are ultimately bullied by the aggressive drivers. 

This isn't unique to cars in San Diego either. I had to learn the quirks of all the different construction supply houses. None of them seem to have marked entrances or signs from the street, are on weird streets that follow a small valley to a dead end or an old frontage road next to the freeway, and good luck finding the front door! And local folks look at you like you got three heads because you didn't go to the same spot that they have known about for decades. 

I don't think there's a solution aside from people acknowledging the city is growing with new people (even if on average the city is shrinking in population) and the general nimby-ism and chicken little mentality of how the city is failing is a dangerous mindset and can be seen in the driving habits and work ethic of the construction workers at least, anecdotally. 

San Diego is cool, I learned to navigate it, but I ultimately moved my work life back to LA, it feels more like my original city, Portland in its gritty tough vibes. San Diego has cool folks, but are outshined by the NIMBY crowd and the entitled crowd. I still visit though",subaru

"Leaking coolant (the greenish liquid you're seeing) is pretty common in a front end collision. It doesn't take much to pop a radiator because of where it's located and the amount of sharp objects in the nearby vicinity to it that can be forced into/through it in the event of a crash. So don't be too concerned with that specifically.

What I'd be concerned with is the fact that your bumper/crash beam (the big thing going across the front) is tweaked like a son of a bitch on the driver's side, meaning the front frame horn on that side is bent pretty significantly. Can it be straightened and fixed? Probably. But should it be? I guess that's for insurance to decide (depends on the cost of repair relative to the actual value of the vehicle). I'd be pretty surprised if this thing gets sent to a body shop and gets fixed. That's a lot of very visible damage, and definitely some more underlying stuff that won't be discovered until it's torn into a little ways.

This isn't quite apples to apples, but I just picked up this Forester (see below) that was ""totalled"" by the insurance company. Aside from the flimsy core support being twisted and the obvious exterior aesthetic stuff that's gone, there really wasn't much structural damage here (radiator, condenser, headlights, grille, etc). Your car is obviously worth significantly more than this almost 20 year old Forester, tho.

“Within your budget” is vague. The dealer could play through numbers and say you can get a low monthly payment… over something super long like 8 years so the total paid is actually a lot more. Or they’ll actually lowball what your car is actually worth for trade-in, or throw in extra things technically not part of the vehicle price that you don’t need, etc.

Also use a quality full synthetic and change every 6 months, spring & fall. Spring to get the winter moisture contaminates out. Fall because of the high summer heat wear & tear.

"If you wish to continue being covered by your factory warranty, have the oil changed every 6k miles or 6mos, whichever comes first. Is it necessary from a mechanical perspective? Personally, I don't think so, but it's free and you get to keep your warranty, so just have it done.",subaru
Jigsaw shifter. Way cooler way and you can swap the shift knob easier,subaru
Excellent! Please buy lots of fresh cylinder oil. It is impossible to flush that too thoroughly.,subaru
"I bought a dealer warranty but can’t find the pamphlet now, I’ll have to go grab one and see if it hopefully has anything about that covered",subaru
Isn't that the code for Right-hand drive Asian market?,subaru
"Yeah I need to map a process and I learned I miss my old parking brakes lol.

Thanks for the resources.  I'll dive into this and report back.",subaru
"IIRC for the older CVTs 120-130k miles was the magic number. If it was going to go bad, that’s when it was going to happen. A good buddy of mine is a parts manager at a Subaru dealership in my area, and he used to joke that I was in the danger zone while my 2012 Legacy was in that mileage range.",subaru
I just hope they died in that and I don't wish death on people,subaru
"That's a smooth ride, props are due. Here's mine. stage 2 (all cobb) EJ20x swapped

The irony, they are both addictive, expensive, and dangerous.",subaru
I’ve seen lots of boots come with zip ties as clamps,subaru
"He's doing you a favour.

You should listen to his wise counsel.",subaru
Yooo I just saw this somewhere else earlier today. So rad,subaru
"Not 100% if thats causing the issue. That parts a strut top mount/hat. It's worn out, looks old.",subaru
"Not everything. There is a lot of stuff that's dangerous, but not super bad at same time. Most of the snakes are ok unless you annoy them (or accidentally stand on them). The sharks usually aren't to bad other than when the whales pass through. Its the spiders for me though. Koalas and kangaroos are more likely to attack than the snakes, or sharks. The crocodile's can be an issue up north though.",subaru
38325KA010 should be a valid substitute for 38325AA032. Partsouq lists substitute parts when you put in a part number and it should work.,subaru
"Does anyone have a service bulletin or service manual reference for how Gen 4 Outback or similar era Subarus treat history C-code DTCs?  My case in particular involves C0281 and C0282 codes.  


I had a dealer technician misdiagnose and deny extended warranty coverage on the parking brake actuator defect.  Scanning with my own tool shows the two codes were cleared to historic, but I can't seem to find any official information on how many start-stop cycles clears history DTCs.",subaru
There is a time and a place.  I just traded in my 2013 WRX for a 2024 Outback Wilderness.  The WRX was getting a bit low for my knees 🤣,subaru
they're inverted/topmounted. it will go everywhere,subaru
10 year+ old plastic? Not really surprised.,subaru
I cant really see why it wont fit. the chassis or parts for that matter where more or les the same from the nineties to the early 2000s. but check with a mechanic just in case.,subaru
That's pretty sweet!,subaru
"Has anyone ever been to a dealership, auto repair, or oil change shop that doesn’t overcharge for windshield wipers or air filters?",subaru
"This language is supposed to be the ""call to action"", not some insinuation of the quality of said car that they are making an *amazing* offer for.",subaru
"No. Customer requested a specific procedure. There was no safety concerns, you do the procedure.  

You are making assumptions, you assume they started the car and moved it. You don’t know that for a fact. As a mechanic I’ve pushed many no start cars to and from the bay. We used a dingo. We had through bays so a tow strap and second driver was all that was needed.  

We had customers decline repairs like engines and have you-pull-and-pay come pick the car up from us. 

The garage performed a specific task OP asked them to do. Case closed.  
I have dealt with many of you, come in because your car won’t start and tell me to replace the starter only to learn the ignition switch was bad and the car still doesn’t start. Then cry about how I shouldn’t have replaced the starter.  

Or ask me to change the burnt black transmission fluid in your POS with 245k miles and then cry the transmission is slipping and I shouldn’t have changed the fluid.  

You pay the shop to diagnose and develop a repair procedure then execute that procedure. THEN it’s my liability to make sure everything was done correctly and with precaution to potential conflicting issues.",subaru
Crazy level of incompetence man.  I’m sorry,subaru
"Is the smell moldy or musty?  The problem is going to be locating where and what is causing the smell.

I am having a similar issue and recently posted about it (no one responded to my post).  A few weeks back a moldy/musty smell developed in my 2014 Forester.  I noticed it when opening the door.  It has become more noticeable and really smells when the air is running.   

Took it to the Subaru dealership and they could not identify where the smell was coming from.  All filters were changed at that time.  I then tried using Lysol in the outer intake air vent, which only alleviated the issue for a few days.  I then used an Ozone Machine for 20 minutes, which seems to have taken care of the smell over the weekend.  I understand that it is highly likely going to return because the source hasn't been identified.  

However, I am having the car looked at by a local repair shop this week that will do a more detailed inspection than the dealership.  I'll try to remember to respond if they find out what the issue is.",subaru
Make sure you get comps don’t let the insurance low ball you. You can enter the VIN into Vroom and Carvana and it probably won’t show the total loss claim yet to get a baseline floor for comparison.,subaru
