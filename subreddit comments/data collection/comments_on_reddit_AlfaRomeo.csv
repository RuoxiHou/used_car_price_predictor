"When you say Sharper curves, can you give an example? For the most part I'm not hugely concerned about the curves, because I'm traveling on 22 and I99 in PA, which is mostly a straight shot. I don't even trust my K5 fully around bends; I'll usually grab ahold of the wheel and nudge it, if it's not adjusting to the curve properly",AlfaRomeo

"It seems to be decently equipped, with xenon lights and electric seats and whatnot. Make sure the rear suspension isn't worn though. A complete refurbishment of that is costly on a 166.",AlfaRomeo

Just like your wife,AlfaRomeo

My 2018 Giulia has Apple Carplay.  Mid to late 2018 builds should have it.  Best to confirm with the dealer if it actually has it.  Connecting an iPhone via usb cable under the A/C controls should show if it has it or not on the screen.  Prices will vary widely with how the car was originally spec’ed.  Are the 2018 and 2020 apples to apples?,AlfaRomeo

"It's a fine car. The 2.0 JTS is the best petrol engine for that car. Fuel consumption is 7-8l/100km. Front suspension needs parts every other year, and handbrake wires rust and freeze but they are cheap and fairly easy to change. Stick to maintenance schedule and change oil regularly. Check for the last cambelt change, as it should be done every 3 years. 

T. Kolme tällasta omistanut ;D",AlfaRomeo
The Stelvio is a fantastic SUV I must say. I sold my Giulia for one with no regrets. The Giulia is a fantastic car… but the Stelvio steals the show and put Alfa back on the map.,AlfaRomeo

"Well, if you'd go with the AWD and then disable, you would have some extra weight to the tune of 100kg in there. Something to consider",AlfaRomeo
"Yes, forgot to add max piston speed. When
I first started tuning it was considered 20m / second.

But high piston speed means you’ve also got to decelerate and accelerate those pistons importing huge loads. I’ve seen vehicles where unknowing tuners have lifted the Rev limit leading to stretched rods and big end bolts. It is not only max piston speed.",AlfaRomeo
Lovely car same model as mine 😍😍,AlfaRomeo
"CORRECTION: This is an ‘82

Also a bit of history: I’m friends with the owner, and he can’t drive the car any more. He was never terribly mechanically inclined, but the car ran well when I drove it last year. When I tried to move it this year, battery was dead (as expected). I swapped it out, but it wouldn’t turn over (I could hear a little thunk, but it was feint when I tried to get it going). It needs a new parking brake (the old one is siezed), some transmission work (usually won’t fall into reverse), and I’m sure more (definitely needs all fluids changed, etc).",AlfaRomeo
"Which engine is it? I’m searching for a Giulietta or 159 with a 1750TBi. Would prefer a 159 with that engine but long term would rather like a newer year of production, and that’s where Giulietta comes in.

I think it looks great! The only downside to consider is that a color like this tends to get out of style at some point and also it’s not everyone’s bag. So it might diminish value if you ever want to sell it in future.,AlfaRomeo
"The upper intake on the driver side is for the intercooler, the lower intake on the driver side cools the transmission. The upper (only) intake on the passenger side is air intake for the engine as well as a duct to cool the turbo area of the engine bay. I believe that the transmission duct was added for the North American cars and might not be on the European models. Maybe they learned that this was a failure point and fixed before releasing to North America. Maybe it is because the NA cars are heavier, not sure.",AlfaRomeo
"I dont because i didnt buy it to be a race car, i woulda got the quad if i wanted to do that. But I cant afford that at the moment",AlfaRomeo
"I second the recommendation for Tom Winkels.  He did my warranty for $400 cheaper than any other quote I received.  Easy to work with.  

I bought my Giulia from a private seller 7 hours away from me.  I flew there and drive the car home.  He had a PPI done for me at the local Alfa dealer prior to our agreement to purchase.",AlfaRomeo
"Grab a giulia Q, she will appreciate",AlfaRomeo
"I got an 2022 Giulia Sprint (used) this January, and I mainly drive it for commute (about 15 minutes one-way) during weekdays. Somehow I observed the auto start-stop does not happen regularly (I’m sure I didn’t disable the function.), unless I’ve driven the car for a longer period of time continuously (for instance, going on a scenic drive on weekends).

I suspect Alfa does not allow auto start-stop when the battery is below some threshold? Yet, I’ve never gotten any kind of warnings on my dashboard, e.g., auto start-stop unavailable or low battery level 🤷‍♂️",AlfaRomeo

The Subaru has either a 0 hp 4 or a turbo 4 not the 3.6 V6 - IIRC,AlfaRomeo
How much would that cost?,AlfaRomeo
"I’m not that bothered by it, since it isn’t noticeable from afar but it is an issue nonetheless. Just procrastinating getting it fixed while I decide to have an independent shop look into it or a dealer (if it’s something they can do).",AlfaRomeo
"It’s actually pretty good, I chose a 21 because it’s still got a good amount of life on the factory warranty but you could get an older cpo or with the mopar warranty if you’re too concerned. I’ve had this car for about 7-8 months now and I’ve only had two issues. I gas a check engine light for an emissions code which ended up being a vapor canister, fairly quick fix. The other one was my battery lost charge in the cold and wouldn’t start but all they ended up having to do was recharge the battery.",AlfaRomeo
Yep.,AlfaRomeo
You unlocked some new dash emojis.  Cool!,AlfaRomeo
Smash,AlfaRomeo
From the 90s definitely the 33 with the flat 4 (if you like welding maybe also the SUD).,AlfaRomeo
I’d have a mechanic check it out. Most those miles are probably highway. Might cost 3-5k in maintenance per year.,AlfaRomeo
"Few reasons NOT to get an Outback:

- You’re a man

- You’re not a women that likes other women

- Do you go into Walmart and choose whatever clothes fit, just because they fit? No. You select clothes that fit your personality, body, activity, etc. Same goes for buying a car!!

- most importantly, they cost the same… like, how could you still want something less luxurious, less sporty, less pretty, less feature loaded, for the same price?? Don’t come at me with “reliability”, my Subaru was the most dogshit car I’ve ever owned. Now, I did own a 2006 Impreza WRX with the EJ255 motor (motors now are FA20 or FA22 or FA25) but they’re equally unreliable, just in their own ways.

I spent about $4100 keeping my Subaru running over the course of 14 months.


My Alfa Romeo Giulia 2.0T Sport Q4 cost me $1200 over the course of 19 months. What was that for? Coolant flush and brake fluid flush, along with three separate oil changes!",AlfaRomeo

"I bought a new stelvio qv 2 years ago, very happy with it with it. Quality is fine, inside and out. Controls are logical, convenient and easy to use, drives well, fast as hell, sport/race mode transforms it into a very quick car, it handles too. Wife has new cayenne hybrid, it’s quick, comfortable, well built and quite soulless, I prefer my stelvio. I don’t like the auto stop/start (turn it off) or the nanny state seatbelt warning chime, the parking sensors can be a little enthusiastic, surround cameras would be nice, but these are very minor criticisms I’m struggling for. 

If they did a slightly bigger car with a v8 I’d buy it tomorrow. I suppose the closest to that is a Maserati Levante trofeo, which I am currently considering buying. I take your point about common criticism of the Levante, I’ve driven a few and I don’t see what people are complaining about. Maybe they haven’t actually driven one themselves?  The problem with the competition from Audi/BMW/Porsche/Mercedes and a couple more also rans is, well, they’re mostly just a bit too German for my taste. Porsche dealers are best of a dreadful bunch, everyone else is a bit rubbish compared to that and my Alfa dealer really wasn’t the best.

Sorry for rambling!",AlfaRomeo
I think it needs more pictures,AlfaRomeo
"That’s awesome dude! I’m 24 now and sold my Alfa, regrettably. They’re great vehicles so long as you treat them right. I just hope this economy starts turning around soon. Lots of folks aren’t understanding the concept of money and living within their financial means, so inflation will keep climbing so long as folks keep thinking they can live outside their means. Price of something is high? Too bad, people are going in debt for it. What does that mean? The price was never too high, because folks are buying it. If it was too high, nobody would buy it. I swear America is becoming a “look at me” competition. Gotta have all the Gucci, the g wagon, the private school, the fancy lunches, etc. inflation is going nowhere if people keep spending like money ain’t worth a damn.

Rant over.

"I just bought a 2020 Stelvio, out of state for the first time and had it shipped to me. This is what I did.

Call the dealer with the car and ask them about it. Ask them if there are any known issues either mechanical or cosmetic that don't appear in photos.  Most people will mention things.

Ask the dealer to provide a total out the door quote (not including transport) that includes all required fees and no optional ones. Assuming you're okay with that, proceed. 

Tell the dealer that you need to have it inspected at a mechanic nearby. They should be willing to drop it off there and pick it up after. If they say no, walk away. Find a well rated mechanic on Yelp nearby. Call them, ask them if they do prepurchase inspections and if so, what they do. Good ones that do these regularly have a checklist and will provide a report, sometimes with photos. Tell them you're out of state so that they note things that might be obvious in person but missed in photos esp things like included accessories (spare tire, 2 key fobs etc). After you get the report, talk to the mechanic and ask them what they think about the car. Again, there might be things not mentioned in the report. If the inspection is good proceed.

Tell the dealer you'd like to move forward. Most should let you pay a few thousand on a credit card as a deposit while they wait for a cashier's checks. They will send you paperwork to sign, and you will send the check. Once the check is received and cleared it's yours. This was done via FedEx overnight by my dealer. 

I arranged my own transport using Josh at Beamautotransport who is a broker. You can call him to get an estimate before he will not begin arranging transport until the dealer confirms the car is all good to be picked up. If you're having it transported enclosed, now's a good time to ask the dealer to have it washed for you so that when it arrives, you can confirm the condition matches the listing photos. I paid $1,000 to have it shipped 800 miles enclosed. Was supposed to be delivered in 24 hours but weather delayed it and it took about 48 hours. Waiting for and watching your new (to you) car roll out of the trailer is the best feeling ever.

 Enjoy!

For Mopar warranty, if you buy it when it still has its factory warranty it does not need to be inspected. You don't need to purchase before 36K miles but I believe the price increases after 36k miles (also 12K, 24K too).",AlfaRomeo
Did you tighten the bleeder valves on the calipers?they are at the top of the caliper on each side.

I'd go as far as to say the steering feels better than my Giulia, to which I upgraded to recently. The suspension is not the most comfortable, but you can't have it all.

 Be careful though, it's not easy to consider other cars after you have owned an Alfa, there is something a little special about them :D

Just keep up on maintenance and dont skimp but most of the reliabillity issues /improvements were fixed with the 2020+ models",AlfaRomeo
Unique and beautiful,AlfaRomeo
What do you mean haha ?,AlfaRomeo
"I’m no expert but the newer ones have port injection or something like that, apparently without it there’s buildup which can cause issues",AlfaRomeo
"I mean, the Stelvio is comfortable and well appointed, and adequately powered for around the city. In the other hand, your girlfriend is presumably nice to cuddle up to and may be a keeper…. 
I think the fact that the car will still be looking great in 5 years, but the girlfriend may not be around I would say the argument falls that way - Alfa over girl. I mean, the fact you have come to ask this suggests you know it’s the right answer. Good luck, but I am sure driving around in it will help you find a more refined girl.

"The two things that were unexpected for me were the high cost of service and the high cost of insurance. Oil changes at the dealer are over $600 in my area and an independent shop can’t do them much cheaper because the filter is $250 from the dealer. There are some alternatives but they require ordering the oil and filter online yourself. Also, most people report that the serpentine belt service is in the 3-4k range. That needs to be done every 4 years and requires the front end to be disassembled. 

Insurance is also quite expensive. Most insurers quoted me over $300 a month despite a clean record. I was able to find one insurer that covered the car for a more reasonable amount. ",AlfaRomeo
Danku! Veel Nederlanders hier haha. Maar het is in Brabant!,AlfaRomeo
"Owner said he’s put $3k (Canadian) into it. The brakes are good. He hasn’t started it in a while but it ran when he parked it, though that doesn’t me much because it’s been there for as long as I can remember. No backseat but the rest of the interior looks decent. Approximately how much would it be to get it running and rust fixed if everything, including the frame is decent?

Completely forgot to add that the owner said he completely rebuilt the engine before he parked it.",AlfaRomeo

"Tires could be fine. But it could be a slight imperfection in a rim. Meaning hitting something like a pot hole or curb. I used to work at a few dealerships. And sometimes you would not feel a vibration until you reach higher speeds where the wheels are spinning faster. At those speeds to me it seems like a slight bend to a wheel most likely the front but could be the rear. But if you are feeling it by the rear view mirror that would be my guess. They can also do what is called a road force balance on tires. (Where they don’t just balance them but actually put force on the tire while balancing) you could try that. Also I would take a look at each rim very carefully. Even on the inner side. Look for slight scratches,imperfections. That could be a sign of a bent wheel. Just my thoughts. Also could be a wheel bearing but that was when I worked on Lexus and Toyota",AlfaRomeo
Generally the price difference also includes whatever the warranty year and mileage.  If you go to a dealer and get extended warranty they may charge the 2019 more even same mileage as 2020.,AlfaRomeo

"Yes. My wording isn’t clear, I see now. What I meant was Tesla’s depreciation is a temporary effect, I guess somewhat “unrelated” to the car itself. Alfa’s depreciation is due to other factors, which doesn’t make it appealing for the used market anyways. Tesla’s a different story though, its depreciation doesn’t carry a negative message to those who’s contemplating to get a used one.",AlfaRomeo

"It would be a nice project if you have the resources. If you need a car to do a job, like get you to work, buy a working car. If it something you can afford to do up, or renovate, or have the resources and skills to undertake then yeah; do it. If you can not afford to buy a working car, then I am merely suggesting that you would find it much more expensive to make a non-running car work.

If the car start, runs, and most importantly, has good brakes, then take a punt. But no one can tell you how much it will cost 'to make it run' from four photographs.

Reddit can not answer this for you without a lot more info. Whats up with the engine, what condition are the brakes in, are you going to repaint it, is the body work intact, is the exhaust rusty, are the shock done etc.

You have to decide what resources you have v what resources and effort you need.",AlfaRomeo
"That's sarcasm right?

JTD performance does a downpipe for your engine but it will be noticed on your technical inspection which you know is a big no no and that's why I didn't mention it

"Done loads these.   

Getting the old one off is a walk in the park.   4 bolts on the mounting, big bolt under the spring and the ball joint.   Ta-dah, what’s so hard?   Er, getting the 4 bolts back on the subframe is impossible with all of the rest of it assembled.    Eventually you get pissed off and cross thread them, ruining the arm. 

First up, do you have a decent arm?    Delphi, OEM, Birth.   The cheap eBay ones break as you lower the car onto them and will be knocking again in 200 miles.

The trick with fitting these is to get as much of the suspension out of the way as possible.   With nothing pressing on them, they bolt up easily.   As soon as they are under load - impossible.

1) Disconnect the ARB on both sides.

2) You could undo the axle nut and swing the whole lot out of the way, but you don‘t want to do that.   

3) I’d unbolt the strut from inside the engine bay and pull the whole lot out - 4 nuts and you can change the upper arm while you have it in front of you.  Use a jack toget the hub up and out of the way, then put the lower arm in.",AlfaRomeo
"mine is on factory suspension, sits kinda high but still rubs when I have passangers.

Befroe this one, I had 147 3 doors (only reason I changed it) with same tyre specs but on red eibach springs. And that setup was also rubbing 😂

Idk, it seems to me that simplest solution is to widen the arches, there is something like 1-2cm that can be bent upwards from inside. Or cutting that part and ofc applying some protection for the metal😂",AlfaRomeo

"I'm going to have to disagree with the other guy even though he is well informed in general.

I think it's a TI Sport, not a base Sport based on the black trim on the front of the car and the rear diffuser.

The base model doesn't have black trim on the front between the two main air intakes. The base model looks like [this](https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/oem/2017_alfa-romeo_giulia_sedan_base_fq_oem_8_1600x1067.jpg) from the front.

The base model also does not have a diffuser like the car in the pictures does. [This](https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/oem/2017_alfa-romeo_giulia_sedan_base_rq_oem_6_1600x1067.jpg) is the rear of a base model.

I do think it's a Ti Sport because of the sport seats.

The only odd thing is the lack of the 19"" five-hole wheels, but I think those may have been options on the Ti Sport, not automatic inclusions- I could be wrong on this.

The Veloce badging on the side is not stock as the Veloce name didn't exist in North America in 2018, but it can be forgiven because in Europe, the 2018 Ti Sport was literally called a veloce and it *did* have that badging.",AlfaRomeo

"For fairness, I’ve got a 2020 Giulia QV and a 2021 Outback limited and love both. I’ve also had a crosstrek and loved that car, despite being incredibly slow. 

Really, I think it comes down to how the car will be used. If it’s just a grocery getter in town and generally the weather is nice, I’d say the Alfa is a good choice (provided it’s in good shape). If the weather sucks in your area or you intend on driving it on unimproved roads, get the Subaru. If you’re following someone down a gravel road and a rock pops up and hits your hood, you’ll be bummed in the Subaru but would probably absolutely freak out in the Alfa. 

Plus I’d choose the AWD system in the Subaru in bad weather. The RWD based one in the Alfa is great for performance driving, but any non full time AWD system won’t perform in the snow as well as a Subaru/Audi system.",AlfaRomeo

"So I had a MAP tune on the WRX, but no other mods.  MAP tune tried to fix the torque dip in the WRX, and did an okay job of it. 
 But even so, Giulia 2.0 (mine is AWD) is better in every way.  Significantly quicker due to both the power curve and also the 8 speed gearbox.  Comfort, noise, infotainment etc is literally a class above. Unless you're going to be doing track days or plan to be driving at *very* illegal speeds, no need for the quad.  2.0 will still be over the speed limit and then some by the end of the on ramp. I will say, get a 2021 or later 2.0, make sure it's the sport seats, get the paddles, and I think you'll be happy.  2021 or later because warranty, and full carplay/AA.  It's a reliable car (QV is *not*), but people with these on lease tended to drive them sparingly.  Mine is a 2020 with 20k miles on it.  Previous owner clearly never took long trips, so when I did my first drive over 45 min the blower motor had time to start to whine due to a bad bearing, and he'd never noticed it.

Between the Stelvio and the Outback I would go Outback. The Stelvio will drive much better but it’s not going to touch a Giulia. It’s a still a crossover. Personally I don’t understand the appeal of sporty crossovers. Get a sports sedan if you want handling and performance. Get a crossover for practicality and space. The Outback is an excellent vehicle. I really don’t think the Stelvio is that fun, go with the Outback and then later on get a Giulia.",AlfaRomeo

"2020 Giulia here. I find highway assist to be awfully finicky. For one thing, it works only on certain highways, apparently directed by the navigation map. For another, it tends to panic and give up control easily if lane markings aren’t perfect on both sides. For example, when driving on the outside lane of a freeway, highway assist will cancel at an approaching offramp, even though the left-hand lane marker is still perfectly visible. It also tends to lose the score on curves that are less than gentle. Even driving on some older freeways like I-5 in Los Angeles, the design of the freeway is more than the system can handle at speed. I’ve also noticed it is sensitive to the angle of the sun in the sky and how it seems to screw with the camera mounted near the interior rearview mirror. Overall, I’m still happy I have the system because when it works it’s nice, but it’s not consistent, and I can’t rely on it.",AlfaRomeo

"hello, I bought my first Alfa last year in September, it is MiTo from 2009 and only problems that occurred were normal things that you just have to do from time to time. I personally changed a few things, but it was not necessary, it was just for my good feeling, here in Europe there is big propaganda about unreliability but I just liked that model so I bought it. If you buy it from someone who made some maintenance then it will probably be good buy. There is nothing to worry about. Only problems with alfas are electronic things that are almost every time easy and cheap to fix. And maybe it is not the best brand in reliability (for example Mercedes isn't as well) but it is very very very fun to drive, there always was something about Italian cars that is just awesome, so I would say you will be very happy if you buy it. And as you said, you want to buy 2020 and newer so it will probably be almost like new car. So if you buy it, well....enjoy the drive :D",AlfaRomeo

"Use the correct oil as well. By this I mean use oil rated specifically to eliminate Low Speed Pre-Ignition (LSPI). This is a high compression turbocharged engine with direct injection and LSPI can damage the engine almost immediately. Also make sure the correct NGK spark plugs are in the engine, and are changed every 30K miles (48K km.) The wrong spark plugs will contribute to LSPI. Also, use high octane/super fuel.

"I went from a pretty well built (custom EJ257, 6MT, spiider DCCD etc) 2004 WRX wagon to my first Giulia QV. No comparison other than they were both fast. The overall refinement and ride quality of the giulia is lightyears ahead of a WRX. Steering in the Giulia is light and quick, with surprisingly good feedback. Braking at speed is excellent, but parking lot creeping is always an adventure. Had iron and CCM braked QVs and they're both jerky at parking lot speeds. Dropping to N mode helps soften the torque converter's aggressiveness. I drive 90% D, 8% R, 2% N. Bumped into A one time and thought something was broken. 

Giulia infotainment has always been a weak point, and is generally comparable with cars 5 years older. 

Parts wise, not bad on the 2.0L. QV parts are hit and miss, but my dealer's been pretty good about sourcing most of the time.",AlfaRomeo

Check the turbo make sure there’s no carbon around it. And check the radiator for leaks as well as the fluid tanks for coolant.

"I do pretty much most of my own work. I also wrench on my other vehicles (2x BMWs, a Mercedes-Benz, and a MINI Cooper S) and I would say comparatively speaking these vehicles are actually pretty easy to work on. 

You'll definitely need an E-Torx and T-Torx bit set, low and high torque wrenches (ideally in Nm, but foot-lbs works too), and a standard socket wrench kit/set. I also recommend a deep socket set as well as various extensions, it will make certain jobs light-years easier and more convenient. For spark plugs, you'll need a thin wall spark plug socket. 

For diagnostics I use Multiecuscan. 

Parts can be a little annoying. I found a few retailers online that sell reliable parts for these vehicles, for everything else I usually have to go through the dealership (which is a couple hours away). 

So far I've done oil changes, differential fluid changes, transmission servicing, and the spark plugs and ignition coils so far during my ownership. Let me know if you have any questions.",AlfaRomeo

"The Model S i quite a bit larger and will be quicker in a straight line. Most likely it will be cheaper to fuel If you have a charger at home. The Alfa is a more sporty drive, has a nicer interior and will have a longer range and be quicker to refuel. These are very different cars though, and not something you’d usually be cross shopping.

My guess is also that the Alfa will be more reliable (not every day you can say that). The Model S has issues with almost every part that isn’t the Mercedes switchgear. Rear control arms, most of the AC system, air suspension, wiper linkage, middle brake light and door handles are common familier points. Early models had a good few issues with the drive units, and some also had battery failures. Those are several thousand dollars for the parts alone. 

Putting my heavy Alfa bias aside: I’m not anti EV or particularly anti-Tesla. They’re really damn quick, and I’ve enjoyed driving a few of them in the past, but I would never buy a Model S out of warranty. That car has a high likelyhood of becoming very expensive very quickly.

"I didn't know where the OP was initially, but then I looked up the dealer based on the license plate surround URL in the photos, and it appears he is in the UAE.  So Veloce trim may have existed at the time in the EMEA disribution / sales region that covers UAE.

In the USA, you could get a Sport Package that would add the front and rear sport facias to the base Giulia.  But as you stated, the sport seats pretty much make it a Ti Sport because they were only available on the Ti Sport.  

Anyway, I found this yesterday trying to dig around for my documents on when I built and ordered my 2018 Giulia.  This Alfa Romeo USA PDF gives much more detail on available equipment and options in 2018:

">I guess I should have rephrased, the QV is “cool” in the sense you described.

I figured as much, just making sure :).  There isn't much difference between the 2024 models and the 2020+.  Small changes that I'm sure are noticeable, but it's not like going 2019 or before, with the old infotainment. There is a new infotainment, but it's a much smaller jump, and since you'll be in AA/CarPlay most of the time anyway the only difference really is the screen brightness, which I've had no issues with.  That, and the digital dash.  You can get a 1-2 year old Veloce for 30% off new, with almost no miles, so I don't see the point of new given how significant the savings are.",AlfaRomeo

I have a 2018 and I bought it after it was bought back due to engine failure. It had 700 miles on it when I got it. After 1 oil change last year the low oil light came on. It was towed back to the dealer and they didn’t find anything wrong. They changed the oil and filter again and it’s been fine. I replaced the primary radiator due to a leak . That seems to have been a problem with the early ones but that problem was a supplier issue and not an assembly problem. The original battery is still in it and I haven’t experienced any problems with the supposed carbon build up yet.,AlfaRomeo

"Used at street temps CCBs will last an extremely long time compared to iron rotors. I wouldn't worry about it on a Stelvio, less likely to see track time than a Giulia. 

Should easily last 80-100k miles. There are iron replacements available from Girodisc for about a quarter the price of the CCBs if you have it that long.


I wouldn't plan on getting the carbon ceramic rotors 'refurbished'. Not even sure how that would work, they're cast/molded and baked as a single piece and are replaced based on a minimum weight (in terms of wear). 

Have CCB's on my Giulia. They don't produce dust and stop extremely well. Except when the discs are wet, so be mindful of that first stop after a carwash. They're also huge and look awesome, I get lots of comments on the size of the rotors, they really fill out the 19"" wheels on a Giulia.",AlfaRomeo
"There is no rust or 100% signs of flooding but as per the pre purchase inspector, he is suspecting that the car might have been flooded.",AlfaRomeo
"I had the same issue in my giulietta. Odometer flashing And blue&me stopped working.

"No, i mean just think you should always have a trusted mechanic look at a car before you buy it.  I can be worth it depending on condition.

"For sure, the depreciation is pretty significant, but I debate how much I really care about that on a car that I want for multitudes of other reasons rather than literal return on monetary ""investment"". I guess the only hangup is wondering if the previous person broke it in properly, maintained it well (especially since you have to be on it for the warranty to be honored), or if they wrung the piss out of it immediately.",AlfaRomeo

Owning both a Subaru and an Alfa Romeo (though different models and manufacturing years) myself, Subaru is a pleasure to work on yourself, while trying to disassemble something on the Alfa makes you want to poke your eyes out with any tool at hand, when you see how much unnecessary effort you'll need to put in for the smallest maintenance tasks 😅",AlfaRomeo
Did you turn the fans all the way up? Not sure cuz I bought mine in November of last year so I haven’t used the AC yet. But it could also be a low charge on the AC refrigerant. I’m not extremely experienced with Alfas yet but I am with other vehicles. I’ve seen cars on low refrigerant be slow to cooling down. Alfas seem to be a different breed when it comes to technology. I tried the AC when I bought it to make sure it works but for some reason it would only be like an auto option. As in maybe it’s not meant to blow extreme air flow but to cool it down to a comfortable temp. Maybe if the interior was warmer the fans might blow harder. Depending on what your temperature is set to,AlfaRomeo

"You're really misinformed and under-informed and shouldn't continue commenting.

It isn't G forces that manufacturers are concerned about it with long stroke CONSUMER engines.  We (I've been a Powertrain Engineer for 2 decades) care about the inertial loading of the piston and rod (and rod bearing) more in race applications, where we're trying to get rid of all excess mass and it is a balancing act between required strength and mass reduction that define our limits.  Adding 50g due to increasing the cross section of a connecting rod beam, isn't really an issue for the OEM, whatever it needs to be it needs to be.  The OEMs care more about the wear rate of the cylinder bore, rings, piston skirt, due to the high surface speeds and side loading that comes with longer strokes used at higher RPM levels.  25 m/s used to be the typical accepted limit for piston ring (stability), although you've got some very high end motorsport applications now exceeding that.

I suspect that rev limit on the GME 2.0L isn't specifically a limit of the bottom end, but likely more a of a practical limit due to where peak power occurs.  Valvetrain stability is likely the real limit for higher RPMs on this engine.  

You should go back and correct your other post and remove the erroneous information relating to crankshaft heat treatment and piston production process.  You wouldn't want to irresponsibly continue misinforming others, as you have become misinformed yourself.",AlfaRomeo

"I’d personally never purchase a first year car, especially with mileage that high. And even though it’s fairly cheap, just remember that if things do break (and they will at that mileage) you’re still buying parts for a car that was $45-60k new.

"When you design a new car you always start from an existing project. It's extremely rare that you invent something from scratch. VW is the master of the modularity for instance. 
The actual Giulia and Stelvio are exceptions and in fact the project costed much more than expected and it took twice as much to develop. 
There are many articles and videos in Italian about the details of the Stla Large which claim some similarities between the two platforms...first of all the initial name of Stla Large was Giorgio 2  https://www.italpassion.fr/it/alfa-romeo/vi-raccontiamo-tutto-su-stla-large-la-piattaforma-per-le-future-alfa-romeo-e-maserati/

Having said that, the platform is just the backbone of a vehicle. There's still a lot of room to personalize the car. I'm pretty sure that an AR will differ from a Dodge or Jeep ans you can see it also now with the current Giulia and the Jeep Grand Cherokee both based on Giorgio",AlfaRomeo

"I’m on my second giulia. First one was a 2017 and needed a lot of repairs towards the end (around 70K miles) and it didn’t make sense financially to fix it vs getting a newer one. So, echoing extended warranty if factory have run out/will run out soon. 

Second one is a 22. So far so good more or less. Still under warranty, so not overly concerned at the moment. Don’t have paddles, which I miss, so recommend getting a car with them, they are a pain to install on your own and takes not insignificant money and time and handiness. 

Look up if there are any Alfa certified mechanics who can perform warranty repair near you. Dealers will charge you more per hour. You may be able to get maintenance done at a dodge/jeep/chrysler but don’t bank on it. Diligent about maintenance, do oil changes more than every 10k.

Equivalent engine options in my country are about twice as much as the Stelvio, which makes the base model the same price as the Stelvio Quad, the 330HP model is a bit more expensive, while for the price of a Trofeo you could buy 2 Stelvio Quads. The Quads will remain on sale in Europe AFAIK, so I guess that's a consolation, but I can't help feeling like Stellantis is running these amazing brands into the ground. Again. And I'll probably end up buying a BMW as my next car. Sadge.",AlfaRomeo

"Yep, the rev hang was another thing the MAP tune did well lol. That and the linear throttle.  Basically made it the way it should have been from factory IMO, never noticed any power gains, but that wasn't the point.  I had the MAP tune on it as a daily for 7 years, 60k miles until I sold it.  Only had the numbers up for the first month or so until I was satisfied it was running smooth.  AP stayed in my desk drawer after that.  Another thing about the QV is that you'll be giving up comfort and fuel mileage, and insurance will probably be double lol.  To be totally honest, 'cool' should never factor into any decision a person makes.  Either you want something for specific reasons, or you don't, and what you really want is turning heads or whatever, ya know? While I think the QV is very cool, I don't want it *because* it's cool, I want one because it's a beautiful car with a great engine etc.  But one, I can't even come close to affording it and two, I need AWD for snowy mountain passes.  I'd say, go test drive the following: A4/A5, Giulia 2.0, and if you want a comparison point, an M340 or S4/S5.  IMO, those cars are all the power anyone could ever need in a daily.  My friend with an M340 calls it 'zero to jail before you realize what the number is'.  The C43 is also an option, but you'll give up some comfort and build quality compared to the others, even the Alfa.  C43 and S4/S5 can be easily tuned later to 450 bhp supposedly with just a stage 1, if more is wanted.  I was originally shopping for one of the German 3, but a few things swayed me.  One was price and mileage.  One non-negotiable IMO should be AA/CarPlay.  Don't get infotainment that's already outdated lol.  To get new enough versions (the refresh for the C43 and S5), the cost was high.  A5 I wrote off because the steering was wayyyyyyy too light and lifeless.  In the end I got a 2020 Giulia ti Sport in the second best color with only 20k miles for $34k, while a german 2.0with 20k miles would have set me back $35k+, and the S4/M340/C43 were at least $45k.",AlfaRomeo
"It started showing up last year. So I feel like even though that is early for clear coat breakdown since it's not supposed to break down at any point, it still had some miles on it.

I asked because I come from a long line of heavy v8 cars into my Giulia (not this one though, I actually ended up going with it over a GranTurismo), and after driving it I prefer the nimble handling and acceleration of the Alfa over those cars.

"Here’s a write up I did that details changes by MY: 

‘17- No CarPlay or Android auto. Electronics can be finicky but this can usu. be solved with a software update. Or two.

‘18- Suspension was raised- many think too high. AAPL CarPlay was added.

‘19- Suspension returned to ~2017 height. Rear seats fold. Last year for direct injection only engine. Steering wheel is thinner on ‘17-‘19 and interior is slightly more chintzy (esp. the plastic around the shift knob.) Steering feel and overall performance driving experience is superior on ‘17-‘19 MYs to later models… but reliability is lower on average and interior quality is inferior. I believe this was the last year that the grill liner (?) thingy was a polished silver color- it later became black.

‘20-‘21- Interior refresh (compare pics using Google- top of my head: shift knob improved as did the center console- esp. around shift knob, it no longer can be started in dynamic so no more awesome cold starts, dials are now metal/feel nicer, wireless charging introduced)

More importantly, the engine architecture also changed to port and direct injection in ‘20, preventing carbon build up. Infotainment became touch screen at some point and added neat performance readings. More sound insulation and thicker windows. Autonomous driving introduced as an option.

Lastly, they revised the steering geometry in ‘20 to prevent “unrefined” wheel hop when turning wheel full lock at very low speeds. Wish they had kept it the same bc it took away 10% of its litheness (per my subjective impression in having owned a ‘19 and moving to a ‘23.)

‘22-‘23 Same as ‘20-‘21 except they did away with standard carbon fiber roof. It had to be optioned as exposed CF (prior to this, if you didn’t option exposed CF, it was still painted carbon.) Pretty lame that they did away w/ std. CF roof without mentioning it. I magnet tested my 2023… yep, it’s metal.

‘24- The 2024 has a revised headlight design- they’re LEDs now. The taillights are also slightly different, and are more “tinted”/smoky. The carbon fiber adorning the center console is now a naked basket weave as opposed to the more traditional, glossy CF. You can feel the texture of it on the ‘24. Lastly, the gauge cluster is digital as opposed to analog and the LSD is mechanical (e-diff was ‘17-‘23.)

I should note that certain trims/options were eliminated over time; certain stitching (like red or green and white), brake caliper colors (yellow calipers were once an option), carbon ceramic brake option, and certain exterior color options, went away (however… one exterior paint color was added: Ocra.) Bright (silver) rims went away at some point too. Not going to get into the purely aesthetic option changes by MY bc they’re too numerous and I’m lazy. You can no longer option carbon bucket seats (not sure exactly when they were discontinued), and manuals stopped being offered in certain ex-US countries in 2019. (Lost in 2020 refresh.) Oh, and at some point the Quadrifoglio badge became plastic instead of aluminum.

Tl;dr- ‘17-19 drove better and felt lighter (I sold my 2019 for a 2023.) ‘20+ are more refined, reliable, and technologically-advanced. Quality is improved at the expense of reduced customization.

Please don’t take this as gospel but I’m 90% sure it’s all accurate. As mentioned, I have direct experience with 2019, 2023, and 2024… drove all 3.

I’d likely pay them to do the work if I were to buy it (sadly I don’t have the money for either at the moment, saving for a daily car and school). I would have to get the rust fixed in order for it to be registered but they’re the cheapest shop in my city so that’s good news at least. 

If I were to get it running, would this be something that could reliably take me to and from school with highway driving to work (5-10 minutes of highway at around 100km/h)? I’m moving away for school so I’d want to come home with highway driving too, roughly an hour long drive.",AlfaRomeo

"1 . Change the oil earlier than recommended . I do every 6-7 k km. 
2 . Put a new battery and make sure its a top battery . Alfas tend to throw random errors as soon as the quality of the battery drops . Ive seen batteries that were fine in other cars but somehow my car didn’t loved it . 
3 . Just give the car love in general and let the turbo rest for 2 minutes after long and harder drives before turning the engine off . People tend to drive Alfas like track cars and maintain them like 1.8 90 hp Toyota Corolla’s . 
Also find yourself a mechanic that loves Alfa and maintain the car only with him , otherwise official garage will drain your wallet for every little thing you will need . 
Also take care on the roads … its really hard to drive them slow . Every day when i go to work i say to myself “ today i will drive legally and will save fuel “ but you just cant with them .. the driving pleasure wins every time and they just start warming up at 120-140 km/h",AlfaRomeo

"These things weren't particularly good daily drivers when they were new. We used our (then, very nice) Milano as a daily for about nine months back around 2010 or so. I think I spent about $3k keeping it going during that time. 

So yeah. This is a fun thing to dream about, and definitely worth talking about. But at the end of the day (IMO) this is a parts car, or a runabout that is never more than a short tow-truck drive away from the shop. This should emphatically not be considered for daily duty without dropping some serious cash on it, and you don't want to do that because you're facing the classic boater's dilemma: is it a vehicle, or is it a hole in the water you pour money into?",AlfaRomeo

There are definitely some gremlins out there, but depending on the mileage, how it's been driven, and how it's been serviced there are some exceptional deals out there.

Edit: if you want to save money, i would recommend looking for a used front bumper. Has to be good condition (few scratches, no dents or cracks, colour doesn't matter) and exactly the right part though (check part number). You can easily save 200-300€ here.",AlfaRomeo

"Yes! I bought my 2019 Stelvio a year and a half ago, I’ve been to the shop about 10 times since then. It first started off by going into limp mode, CEL and electronic throttle control… shop replaced the part, no biggie… then the speakers went out because something to do with the ECM damaging it. Then the windows stopped rolling down because of the faulty temperature sensor in the passenger side mirror. Then the headlamp switch went bad and would randomly turn my headlights off when it was pitch black out. Now my passenger side doors do not lock or unlock, and the oil pump just went out on my car. It’s truly been a nightmare. My warranty has saved me many times, but I live an hour and a half away from a dealer so it’s a struggle trying to actually get the car up there. I also live in Minnesota and have found that the AWD does not work as well in the snow compared to other brands. Don’t even get me started on how barely any shops will actually look at the car if you start to have problems. Pretty much are forced to go to the dealer for anything that’s not an oil change.",AlfaRomeo

To op: As 3yrs 159 owner (360k km now, 1.9 with faulty m32, which gladly never caused me any issues). But it's one way to know if it's going to wear soon - if you put a gear, start accelerating and gearbox shifter is shaking, then definitely don't buy that. 

In terms of fuel economy 1.9 is not great either. It's heavy car. 2.4 as businessYoung said have cracking cylinder head, which you can avoid by putting (or after it will crack) cylinder head from 166 if i am not mistaken. In breras with 210hp version it was fixed iirc (they also had 2.4 diesel).

First serious response. The Outback will definitely be more reliable and you will have less problems with it than the Stelvio. That being said. The Stelvio will drive like a dream. The handling and agility on those is insane. Now if you are planning to state a family with her her in the future then obviously go for the Outback as it’s a better family car but if you have no plans for a family anytime soon then I’d suggest the Stelvio. The Outback will also last longer in terms of mileage but no other cars drive like Italian cars. Also the Subaru isn’t all that fast the Stelvio is.

When that Ferrari engine kicks on and roars it is truly one of the best sounds ever.  The Alfa is light and nimble.  The GT is heavy and powerful, but it corners fantastic as well.  They both have adequate seat room in the back, and surprisingly I think the GT has more leg room.  You can't go wrong with either imo and if you are lucky enough to have both, they compliment each other perfectly.  If I could only have one it would be the GT though.",AlfaRomeo

I personally enjoy having the power underfoot on my Guilietta Cloverleaf.

"I figured that’s why they were down voting, but I still stand by the comment. A 19 month old, 16k mile, 80k car should not be doing this. My MK5 Supra that I had before this car looked flawless.

If the dealer and Alfa were acting better about the situation, it would be different, but they don’t seem to be moving urgently to fix it. I’ve been dealing with this issue for going on 3 weeks and the dealer is dragging their feet about getting it in for this paint test. I asked on Friday if they could make time for me sometime this week at 4:30 in the afternoon one day and I have yet to hear a response. At first they even tried to say it looked like a car wash did it which is insanity.

The only other advice I can share is to ultimately switch from the Pirelli P-Zeros to the Michelin Pilot Sport 4S when you need new tires.  You’ll have to upsize the rear tire width by 10mm but it is very worth it for the better ride, reduced road noise, and most importantly, the expanded tire temperature operating range/grip in colder temps.  Enjoy your beautiful car!",AlfaRomeo
"This engine is very tough and designed to be used hard though not doing so won’t hurt it. 

Crank is forged, nitrided and has superfinished journal surfaces.
Pistons are forged and underside of crown is oil cooled from oil squirters in the block.

Biggest two risks with this engine are:-

1) it uses the MultiAir system so correct and frequent oil changes are critical. Read up on the correct spec oil and be 100% certain it is used at every oil change.

2) it is direct injection so your intake ports will eventually carbon up. To help prevent that it would be best to fit an oil catch can and not feed the oil / air fumes back into the engine to be burnt.

Also, and oddly for a modern engine, it is “long stroke” engine, meaning the stroke is longer than the bore diameter.",AlfaRomeo

"Most cars in the class of car the Giulia and Stelvio are in are leased, not bought. So very high 2- year depreciation results in much higher lease costs compared to an equivalent BMW or Audi. When these 'buyers' are shopping, a $300/mo lease and $500/mo lease is huge. They don't care about MSRP, just monthly cost, and the depreciation is the main factor in that. So Alfa sells fewer new cars as a result. Alfa doesn't care at all about used cars. That car has already been purchased. That's money in their pocket. They don't get more.",AlfaRomeo

"You can buy the Mopar extended warranty for Alfa Romeo since the brand is owned by the parent company Stellantis.  There are tiers of coverage depending on what you want covered.

It's affordable, has a low deductible and it's better than any third party warranty.  If you buy your AR from a Stellantis dealer you can sometimes roll it into the loan as well.  If not, there are a few contacts the forum people use that do zero markup on the premium.

It's best to buy it just before the factory warranty ends, because it's cheaper, and also it starts the day you buy it.  I bought my warranty 7 days before my QV warranty ended.",AlfaRomeo

Currently fighting with the dealer. They want to test just the paint on the hood and not on the a pillars. They are saying “rock chips caused the clear coat peel” which is total BS. A local reputable body shop told me this is a clear case of clear coat failure and to have all the areas tested.,AlfaRomeo

"The GME 2.0L gasoline engine used in the Giulia does NOT have a nitrided crank and the pistons are NOT forged.

The crank is produced from a mid-grade steel and is a mass production style forging (with only 4 counterweights) and induction hardened journals.  Almost all modern cranks in the past 25-30 years go through controlled superfinishing polishing of the journals uses two halves of a concave radius shoe that retains the polishing tape and these two shoes clamp down on the journal and oscillate as the crank is rotated.

The pistons are die cast aluminum.

The crank specs you gave are accurate for the Quadrifoglio, but even the Quadrifoglio engines have cast pistons for cost savings.

Since most modern engines are designed to cruise at low revs, look at the shift points in automatic, you tend to design for longer strokes to give the engine a bit more natural torque and driving flexibility in the low RPM range to help fill in the gap to when the turbo builds sufficient boost.  Jag's Ingenium family is relatively ""long stroke"", same with BMW's current B48 4-cyl (94.6mm stroke).  Mercedes 4-cyl M260/M264 at 92mm stroke.  It isn't uncommon at all, it is actually the design route most manufacturers have taken in the past decade.",AlfaRomeo

"Quite frankly, it’s the perfect balance of size, sportiness, practicality (for a sedan w/ hatch) and comfort in one package. A really excellent daily driver. 

However, I did have one significant failure at about 8k mikes where the whole car went into limp mode for an unknown reason. Dealership said the code and Acura HQ called for a replacement of the gas pedal… (weird). Since then, no issues. 

Also, I keep seeing in r/acura a lot of reports of the “sticky steering wheel” affecting what looks to be 24MY Integras where the steering wheel shows resistance when turning at high speeds. Some defect with a steering column component is my understanding. My 23MY doesn’t have an issue like that, but apparently it’s something that is being investigated for the Integra and Civic models.

I daily drive the car everyday putting lots of miles. Smooth on the highway and an absolute hoot on winding roads. Suspension can feel a bit stiff at times but still super comfortable.",AlfaRomeo

My 159 is parked and stopped. Clutch problems.,AlfaRomeo
"I rolled my arches! It helped but it didn't fix the problem properly! It still rubs on the corner where the bumper meets the rear quarter panel, I couldn't roll that part of the arch 😅 

That's interesting that you still rub with passengers on factory suspension. My back seats are useless for passengers at the moment, and I have to be careful how much fuel I fill 🤣 
I was thinking about buying either Koni Sport Shocks for their adjustable dampening, or Bilstein B6 with the Eibach pro kit(the kit that lowers the car 30mm). The logic is the stiffer shock will help with having passengers in the back seats. But I don't want to ruin ride quality. The Ducati Corse came with 18 inch wheels from factory, and the ride was unbearable with those, but they didn't rub because the offset is not as wide as the GTA wheels.",AlfaRomeo
"WTF!?! That prices is nuts. Gorgeous car, no doubt about that, but I’ve seen similar, in some cases better, condition ones go for half that in the last 12 months.",AlfaRomeo
"I have an 18.  Every issue I’ve had with it has been battery related, which has survived multiple battery replacements.  I don’t think it’s just the ones that shipped; either some kind of alternator issue or parasitic drain.  That being said, is more annoying than costly at this point since it’s my first go to fix.  There is a potential upside to the earlier models I don’t see above; mine has CCBs and since I haven’t tracked it, I’ll likely have the motor blow before I need to replace.",AlfaRomeo

"And if you own a modern one, you're fine. Any car built in the past 20 years can be babied or abused, within broad limits, and go forever.

This is not how cars worked before \~1990. Especially before 1980, in Italy. Italian cars in the pre-electronic era were engineered with the assumption they would be driven hard. If they weren't, various narrow passages would get clogged up. Clearances wouldn't be met. Things got, well, sticky.

Back in the day, anyone who drove an Italian car ""like I treasure it"" would bring it to their mechanic every year because it wasn't working right. The mechanic would assure the owner that they'd investigate the problem, wait until the owner had gone home, and then bomb around in the thing for a half hour. It would run fine when turned over to the owner.

It came to be known as an Italian Tune Up. And it's a real thing. 

Again, this is for old Alfas. Old cars, really. But you have to understand an Alfa is engineered with the assumption it'll be driven at 9/10ths regularly. As long as you're not a lunatic, it'll be fine.

Enjoy yours.",AlfaRomeo

Teslas are notorious for having an interior at 50k miles that looks like it's done 200k. You can also get the Alfa with lower miles and crucially, still in warranty for another year or so. The Tesla isn't a bad car necessarily, but IMO it has issues and tradeoffs that means either you *want* a Tesla, or you don't, if that makes sense.

"Interesting, you may be right. For sure the one I saw on Saturday has warranty with Alfa until November 2024, but perhaps it’s a warranty with the Alfa dealer directly (as they’ve done all the servicing each year, I went through the records) rather than Alfa.

Test driving another one in a couple of hours so will ask about this in more detail. Could be a really good flag!",AlfaRomeo

If the mud in in unusual places, such as the corners under the rear cargo area, where mud is not usually found unless it has been flooded, then yes, I would have to agree with the inspector.

Bought the Stelvio Q new about 6 months ago.  5300 miles on it so far.  So we'll likely end up at 11-12k a year for that car.   Which means the accessory belt (not timing belt) will need servicing every 3-3.5 years for our usage.  I'm not concerned about maintenance costs or intervals.,AlfaRomeo

"I’m with you - once you realise that that there are so many compromises associated with lifting the centre of gravity on any vehicle (suspension, for example), an SUV makes no sense. I would have preferred a wagon Giulia if you need the space.

Maybe you’re misunderstanding. I’m not talking about the rock chips I’m talking about the clearcoat that’s peeling off. Take a closer look at the pictures. I’d call THAT poor quality.

"I'm pretty sure there were no Veloces in 2018.  Ti Sport was the top trim, unless you went the Lusso (luxury) route.

In good shape that’s a $20k car.  But non running it’s a gamble. 

Mi currently own 2 Milanos.  One we race in the 24 Hours of Lemons.  It has 190k miles on it and can handle 14 hours of racing.   So they aren’t fragile if they are maintained. 

The other one I bought for the transmission.  It starts immediately even after sitting for a month.

I had a whine in the cabin blower motor, that only shows up after 40 ish minutes of driving.

The Giulia is great, but on my favorite stretch of twisty road, I'm able to get down it at +20% more illegal speed in the Stelvio Q than the Giulia.  And the exhaust note on the Stelvio Q is fantastic, whereas the exhaust note on the Giulia 2.0L is non-existent.

Maybe as an advice, check if there is any rattling from the rear axle and the inner side of the rear tires isn’t run down.

"I had an 1987 Milano Verde which I purchased in 1989 with 11,000 miles. I ran it until 2007 and 145k miles. It never left me stranded and mechanically I had little trouble. I kept after it and it ran and drove well. The Busso V6 is a wonderful and durable engine. The build quality was the real problem. The sunroof was always out of alignment, the AC worked but the condensate ran out on your passengers feet,😮🤣. My wife had the kids belted in and reached behind her and pulled the door shut and the handle came off in her hand.The ventilation fan burned up once and the paint by 1998 looked like the car in the picture OP posted. It may run again but that may be the just the start. I loved my Milano but she was “high maintenance “. I sold it and bought a nice 164L, which was replaced by a 2018 Giulia. The 164 had 277K miles. The Busso will run forever if properly maintained.",AlfaRomeo

The residual was set at 95% which is unheard of, but true.  I was my salesman’s first call and while I was speaking to him, a customer came in to test drive a Levante SUV.  He overheard the conversation, and his literal words were “screw the Levante, I’ll take that deal”, and he did right on the spot.  Once in a lifetime lease deal for a 2024 exotic.  Basically, Maserati is delaying the inevitable loss on the car for another year.",AlfaRomeo

"Alfa Romeo Giulia Trunk Spoiler - Carbon Fiber - QV Style - Feroce Carbon -

Wow .  What a beauty…. what a car 🥰🥰🥰i would cry if it was mine and i had to sell it,AlfaRomeo
Oh I knew it. Watch out for first 1k km if it is consuming oil. Make sure every belt and all it goes with it was changed recently. If the car wasn't drived for years make sure you change all fluids. That engine needs quality racing fuel 10w60 you could go with castrol selenia or motul. Fully synthetic is the go. I have a 1.6ts. They aren't really to expensive to maintain. But they really need proper care. Since a lot of previous users just drive them hard. I think its only natural for them to use oil if they were driven for a long time. I had mine with reworked head and it is still consuming 250-300ml of 10w40. Isnt a  lot but not the best either. If its anything more to you. Maybe your head and pistons need work. Now don't get me wrong I don't think they are bad. Well I like mine even if its still consuming little bit of oil. But I wanted to say that you should be aware of every possible failing point on these cars.,AlfaRomeo
Very unique but not something I’d go for personally,AlfaRomeo

"Well, “technically” its not the charger platform but rather STLA Large, which is a shared platform for ALL Stellantis brands, so its not any one brands platform.",AlfaRomeo
I've owned my 17' for a year so far and it only has 65k miles.  I'm pretty religious with oil changes every 5-6k miles.  The only thing complaint I have is the car has pretty finicky electronics that requires a good battery but other than that it is very reliable.,AlfaRomeo
"I hope it as well :)
I know that the situations might look similar but I think they are different. The unpleasant situation with the Hornet was that the Chrysler side of stellantis didn't believe in the Tonale. As a mid range vehicle, with no legacy.. so they preferred to rebrand it with Dodge..and actually it worked. 
For the Giulia I believe it's different. Different legacy and expectations..it would be really really stupid going for a copy paste solution",AlfaRomeo
"One thing is certain, Alfa's are very similar to BMWs as far as the owner being able to or for that fact, willing to do his/her own maintenance. You really do need to have solutions at your disposal, such as being able not only to properly lift the new Alfas (hydraulic floor jack and lift pads), but also preparing tall enough wooden boxes or pieces of stacked wooden blocks to keep the car raised under the tires. Do you have a garage? Are you willing to remove nineteen or so torx screws from under the front to begin getting to the oil filter and drain plug? How about knowing that removing a wheel is one thing, but installing a wheel without TWO guide pins is frustratingly difficult? I bought a Giulia because I can't drive a boring car, and also am willing to invest my knowledge in automotive maintenance as well as tools and time, along with scouring the interwebs in finding the information on maintenance that is 100% correct for my car. No matter what may happen to my Giulia, I feel confident that I can repair it to a high standard, higher even than a dealership could (that's not saying much, I know).",AlfaRomeo
"Hi, I’ve had similar problem in my former company Doblo. Thing that solved it for us was 
1. Clean which was done with all associated pipes and inlet manifold ( ours was cracked anyway by wankers that done previous service)
2. Connector to Egr has broken cable which was fixed too

Anyway deleted it later on along with remap.",AlfaRomeo
"Bought my 2020 new at a 20% discount, and I’ve never had anything done to the car except regular maintenance, but I only have 29,000 miles on it. Overall, my Stelvio has been more reliable than my previous Lexus. I would say that many people are disappointed in the Stelvio’s bells and whistles, including the poor sound system and backup camera. However, if you enjoy driving, all those bells and whistles are merely a distraction. You won’t find an SUV that handles as well as the Stelvio at any price point.",AlfaRomeo

"Ten eerste prachtige 147, zegt een 147 eigenaar. Maar hoe houd de selespeed het vol? veel

"i feel you bro. the repairing cost side is really one of the biggest downsides to owning an Alfa. they don't break down often but that bill is expensive. there's a reason though these cars are sold at like 170-200k kms the most. before that, they really have a small amount of issues, but then everything kinda needs replacing.

My Spider has 185k kilometres. I've owned it for a month now, and while i truly love the car it's expensive to maintain. i've already spent 700€ on servicing, and it was all fluids replaced, timing belt replaced with water pump, a serpentine belt roller and the back left coil spring. that's just the start of it though. i desperately need new tires, they're going to set me back 800€ because i want good ones. And then wheel alignment and i'll probably need to replace wishbones at the front. Not to mention, in a year or so i'll need a new dual mass flywheel with a clutch set. I almost forgot to mention, my engine has 2 serpentine belts, and the smaller of the two squeals and needs replacing, which is another 250€. so yeah happy days.

Therefore, it's not a cheap affair, but i guess it's worse for you because 1500€ on a mito is a pretty big chunk of the car's value, but you get the benefit of driving the coolest supermini there is. As for my repairs, i know they're worth it, because it just makes sense to me that years down the line the 939 Spider will shoot up in value, and beside that, the car deserves to be perfect.",AlfaRomeo

"Yah the dealer pricing on the Stelvio Quad 20"" wheel is insane, I was quoted $3400 (inc tax) two weeks ago.  They may be out of production by now, as Stelvio Quad production will cease in June.

The 20"" wheel is forged (not cast) in Germany by FUCHS, the same supplier of legendary Porsche wheels.  I'm sure that adds to the cost, but Alfa dealers are still putting an insane mark-up on these wheels.

I needed a rear wheel too, and have one ordered from Jason at Alfissimo.  MUCH MUCH better pricing than the dealer.  It isn't a stock item, you'll need to ask him to order you one.

"Stelvio Quad Dealer Service pricing I've seen quoted elsewhere:

Spark Plug Change:  $600-700

Brakes (4 discs, pads, labor):   $4000+, seriously the discs are $750/ea

Serpentine Belt Change:  $2500-$3500, the entire front facia, radiator, intercoolers, etc have to come off to get to the front of the engine.

The Stelvio Quadrifolgio is an all weather supercar, you have near super car capabilities and operating/maintenance costs.  MPG is awful, I've never reached the quoted 23mpg highway.  Daily commuting and I'm in the 14-15mpg range in mixed driving.  That said, it is extremely efficient at converting hydrocarbons into happiness.  If you can afford to live with one, you won't be disappointed.  I just crossed the 5000 mile mark on the one I got 6 months ago, so I haven't had to do any services yet other than a break-in oil change I had done at 2700 miles and that cost me about $450 at local import specialist (and I supplied the oil and filter, the filter cartridge itself is just like a current Ferrari filter and costs about $90 itself).",AlfaRomeo

QV ❤️💯,AlfaRomeo
"I’m honestly torn. For a longevity of the brand, this is a great thing. The more parts they share, the thinner the margins are to build each car, and the more they can justify continuing to produce a car that sells at lower volumes. Jaguar and Alfa will eternally be my two favorite automakers, but there will be no more ICE Jags in the future so it’s nice knowing Alfas will still have them (for now). Plus, I think it will fill the gap between the 2.0 and the QV. They never really had anything to market against he Jags/Audi/BMW v6 cars.  

On the other hand, and I know this makes me sound like a posh elitist, the Dodge Charger and really that whole brand is the one I’d probably least want to be associated with. It was a nitpicky thing that kept me out of one the first time (plus the previously mentioned V6 issue, I didn’t want a QV). We’ve had late model jeeps in our family, and the Stelantis and finish just reminds me of early/mid 2000’s American cars.  Combined with their current relevance and pulp culture, i.e. street takeovers or the popular anecdote that every other hellcat you see is probably stolen.  

For me, I guess it will all depend on how much of their individuality they’ll be able to retain. Again, posh and elitist, but I just don’t want to know I’m driving a Dodge charger in an Italian suit. I want the real Italian.  And I love how rare they are. I see 1000 muscle cars for every Giulia.  Hoping that ratio does not change.",AlfaRomeo
"I've got one and I've not had any trouble finding parts in the UK, for LHD parts there are a ton still about in the Baltic states and Poland.

"Regardless of cost all cars can have issues with paint.
Fresh Ferraris are notorious for having very big issues and many owners get a full on detail and correction done.

Don't deal with the dealership. Go to Alfa directly.
If they are testing the paint then that is considered doing something in my opinion.

They probably want to see if there are indeed issues in the paint composition in your batch or if you might have had some contaminants from the road or other that compromised the area.

Please do report back with the outcome so others can search and to see how Alfa handles it.

Again, issues can happen on all cars but when you are paying a premium for the car, what matters is how it's handled. This should be considered when shopping for a new car in the future.

Remember dealers are usually sub par after a car is sold. The manufacturer can make it right.

"People these days are so confused.

Modern non-performance oriented turbocharged cars are not even meant to be redlined. They kinda die around 5k and they are engineered to give you a shove around 2k to make you feel as if they're fast.

Cars, not just Alfas lol, cars in general used to need to be redlined because that's where they made their peak power, and peak torque was usually not much below. Petrol cars, especially with larger displacement and/or more cylinders (and especially Italian ones) also used to sound a lot better, mostly higher in the rev-range, so we redlined them not just to make 'em go, but to hear that glorious sound. I remember my old 146 Ti, it would be a real slouch by today's standards, but it sure as hell sounded better than any of these Euro6+ compliant turbo shitboxes.

A freaking Busso, as torquey as it is down low, also only comes alive above 4k.

Everyone's free to drive their own cars the way they want. It just saddens me how ppl these days consider revving an engine to the redline as abuse. I guess there's a reason cars (outside expensive sportscars) are getting more dull by the year.

Not an Alfa, but I had to go and watch [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o40Gqr7nma4) at least 3 times to shrug off the depression this post gave me :D",AlfaRomeo

"Most of the 2.0s are leased when new, not bought, so the service is usually pretty easy to trust.  If you get one coming in off a lease at the dealer that leased it originally, it should be about as confident as it gets (that's what I went with).  I'm not thinking so much about return on investment, but rather how much money I'm spending for what I'm getting.  One, my budget didn't allow new anyway, but two, whatever the budget is, the question I ask is 'what is the best car (for me) that I can get for this money.'  What the 'for me' part is depends on your specific criteria - fun, comfort, reliability, running costs, resale etc.  I could get a sketchy R35 GT-R for $35k, if the reliability, running costs etc were a low enough priority, or if those are the absolute maximum priority, I'd probably wind up with a Camry hybrid or whatever.  It's just a big game of balancing traits to one's preferences for their given price point, which is why advice is always different - too many variables for any two people to really have the exact same set of priorities.

I was confident with my used buy for the following reasons.  It was an Alfa/Maserati dealer, not a Fiat/Alfa dealer, and this dealer has Lambos, Astons etc on the lot and in their shop regularly, so I'm confident the mechanics are quality and used to taking good care of cars (also they aren't joyriding a 2.0 Giulia when they regularly see far more exotic cars - was a frequent concern in the WRX and Focus ST crowds I was in before).  This dealer is the one near Microsoft. It's a very wealthy area, so very low chance it was owned by some kid who couldn't afford upkeep and ragged it.  Car is still in warranty for 9 months (from when I bought it), so enough time to find any lingering issues and have them fixed for free.  Car was a lease trade-in, with full lease-required service records at this same dealer. And finally, there are two local Alfa dealers, both high-end with Maserati and more, so I'm confident they'll be around to keep servicing it.  As for the break-in, that's always hard to really know.  I guess if the car drives right, has the gas mileage and power it should, they probably did?

I have had 3 things pop up on mine on the reliability front, but these are minor and are being fixed under warranty (was just in the shop for the 4-year service slightly early, so I had them look at all these at the same time while it's in warranty).  Also, Mopar extended warranties are pretty affordable for this car- I plan to do that.  The issues I've had: 

Driver seat lumbar adjustment would work, but slowly return to the default position.  Seems to be a clear slow leak in the air bladder that the system uses, mechanic confirmed, new part ordered.  Would be a DIY-able fix as well.  Likely that the previous owner didn't use that part of the adjustment, and never noticed.

HVAC blower motor has a bearing in the fan that is on its way out.  This is a semi-common issue (probably the same part on the QV as well).  Part ordered on warranty. All it does is develop a quiet but high pitched whine after 30+ mins of driving.  Based on the mileage, knowing that the previous owner worked at Microsoft (from chatting to the sales rep), and where he lived, I'd guess he rarely if ever drove far enough to let the bearing heat up and start whining, so didn't notice.

Some strange metal part fell out of the driver mirror housing.  No clue what it is, mechanic didn't know either. Chances are it's something in the adjustment mechanism, but I don't adjust it (only driver) and the diagnostic would be a pain/expense that may not be warranty if they can't find what it came from - may not be from my car at all.  

So my only issues were minor and fixed under warranty, and only expenses were the regular 4-year service, and tires.  OEM tires are garbage in anything by dry conditions, FYI.  They also last about 20k miles, like most OEM tires these days.  Check out the Tire Reviews YT channel for a recent video that goes into why.",AlfaRomeo

Damn wish you all the best of luck with the repairs! I think im pretty much finished with replacing things (i hope) other than a new set of summer tries but thats like 250€ so not too bad. The mechanic said these 1.6 engines are probably the least prone to going wrong from all the Mito engines. Do hope hes right ! About the cost im pretty much good. I payed 3.9k for the car. They usually go for around 5k for a spec like this and you never know when something might go wrong but here i spent 3.9 on the car and 1.5 on the repairs so 5.4k all and i would bet this now drives better than those 5k+ cars people are selling.,AlfaRomeo

"Rust first and most importantly of all. Rusty cars can still be fun, but fixing them properly is much more expensive than a 2a will likely ever be worth. 

82 is the first year for Bosch electronic injection. It's a system that was in wide use at the time and improved the drivability/reliability quite a bit. The hoses might need to be renewed, especially if they're original to the car.

Maintenance-wise it's no better or worse than most cars of that era. But it is really old and will likely need a *lot* of it compared to a modern car.

When the engine is cold, remove the radiator cap and examine both it and the coolant. If there is any sludge evident, that's a blown head gasket. Walk away.

I'm hoping that you're right and the STLA large platform is a true evolution of the Giorgio. But I can't help but think compromises were made so that this platform could accommodate offroad and electric vehicles.

I hope I'm wrong. I hope that the platform manages to elevate Jeep and Dodge instead of taking away from the Giulia's specialness.

The AWD systems is pretty good however, as it's mostly RWD biased and only uses the front wheels when it looses traction. The thing I dont with these systems is that the car decides when it thinks it needs those front wheels, not necessarilly the driver itself.",AlfaRomeo
Is that cloth interior?,AlfaRomeo
Congrats! I’m on my second Giulia and quite happy,AlfaRomeo
That’s what I mean. Just get a Subaru and then a used Giulia,AlfaRomeo
"I have had this happen 3 or 4 times on my 2018 TI. Started up and ran roughly like on 3 cylinders, “sevice engine “ and or “service electronic throttle and CE light all on.“ . Start/ stop is just a byproduct of those warnings. Drive about 3/4 mile and shut off the engine, waited about a minute and restarted. Runs ok now. CE light and “service engine “ stay on. Continued to work, 30 miles, runs normal. Leave work and CE light and start/stop still showing but sevice engine has cleared. Next day warnings still present in the morning but upon leaving work all warnings are clear and everything thing is back to normal.It is usually cold, below freezing or very foggy and wet. I don’t really know if that’s connected. FWIW, I am on my original battery, my dealer mechanic indicated that if you replace the battery and clear any codes thrown everything resets. If you disconnect the existing battery, reconnect and clear any codes it will also reset everything. What he is saying as I interpreted it is: many people replace the battery unnecessarily as it is the disconnect/ reconnection and clear codes that resets the system not the fact that the battery is new. Anyway I don’t panic when the car does this anymore, it just seems to do it once in awhile and clears itself. I am just coming 70K miles.",AlfaRomeo
I also wanna ask like a first time buyer of Giulia...2.2 diesel or 2.0 petrol? I'm interested in Veloce...,AlfaRomeo
"It’s a battery issue! I had the same thing, happen. Don’t worry it’s not a big deal just go to a shop and have them check your battery level, when they swap the batterie you will be all set (or just charge it up)",AlfaRomeo
Hope it comes back the same 😅,AlfaRomeo
Sexy,AlfaRomeo
"Sick,  I think it's Dope",AlfaRomeo
"Just had to have my charcoal canister replaced twice. They are not the most well engineered parts and have a high failure rate according to my dealer. If it keeps happening, and you are certain it isn’t the gas cap, it could likely be this.",AlfaRomeo
I’m first Alfa 146ti. Fuckin loved it. Got me hooked on alfas.,AlfaRomeo
"In Giuliettas that normally means that Blue&Me unit is dead.

I would start from there.",AlfaRomeo
"Going to disagree with that assessment.  We know tons of people who absolutely hate their Teslas and totally regret buying one, especially now that there are much better quality offerings from legacy manufacturers.  They can't wait to get rid of it for a variety of reasons (charging infrastructure, range anxiety, poor quality, sterile interior, etc...).  Buying one used is bringing that much closer to an expensive battery change.",AlfaRomeo
Thank you!,AlfaRomeo
"I guess I should have rephrased, the QV is “cool” in the sense you described. A performance marvel that sadly won’t be around much longer. But I agree. I tried the M240i and realized I was cruising around town 15 over the limit feeling like I was sitting at idle. Nice, but a little too sterile for me. My biggest thing is I kind of want a new AWD Veloce, but those things are pushing used QV prices. And pretty much impossible to find where I live since snow never happens.",AlfaRomeo
Thanks a lot. Very informative,AlfaRomeo
Thanks,AlfaRomeo
"Mine does it all the time as well. I turn it off and turn it back on three times. It clears it every single time. Just make sure to open and close the door after every time you turn it off so accessories mode goes off. Seriously, it happens 2 or 3 times a month for me.",AlfaRomeo
Im never going to afford this one sadly. What a great car!,AlfaRomeo
Drive one and get an extension on the warranty.  Nothing drives like and alfa ! I have a giulia quadrifoglio.,AlfaRomeo
What’s that? 🫠 Never heard of it,AlfaRomeo
Yup!,AlfaRomeo
I actually live in a state where it never gets cold 😭I got my codes to clear in less than 30 mins by refueling but it’s good to know that the cold climate does this because I have a few trips to take out of state in the winter time,AlfaRomeo
Dont know if anybody has the audacity to say “pass” to this thing.,AlfaRomeo

"> this car is one of the best looks cars out on the road

I agree. 

But your title is pure cringe",AlfaRomeo
"Category S? That sounds like the equivalent of a ""Salvage Title"" here in the US!😭 Any chance of getting a car like this MOT certified again? Or is this car more like to get parted out?",AlfaRomeo
Opa brother that is good,AlfaRomeo
"It's the reverse in the USA. See chargers everywhere, especially in the poorer parts. Lots of theft of them because of that. I pretty much only see Giulias in more well off neighborhoods. Stelvios I see a little bit more often.",AlfaRomeo
Bingo! Love my Giulia and it’s a battle sometimes but it’s worth it,AlfaRomeo
old wheels are peak,AlfaRomeo
"Not much, only 680 km in a single drive including stops. I realize those are rookie numbers and I'm going to be breaking them in a near future with a trip to Portugal or to Norway.",AlfaRomeo
"Most people with 159/Breras remove the under tray to help prevent corrosion of the subframes. The under trays have foam which is used as sound dampening, but instead holds water against the subframe and allows it to rust/rot - that'll be the reason why yours is missing. Check your subframe basically 😅",AlfaRomeo
Listen to this guy...its not battery. I had the same problem and i did smt similar just going left and right with steering wheen while driving and it was all good after a restart...only happened once 6 months ago and never again so its not battery.,AlfaRomeo
"I love my QV, it has the lowest  equipment, but I don't care since the driving and the sound is just amazing.
I read that the engine is easier to maintain as well and is more durable since it's built by Alfa Romeo and not Fiat.",AlfaRomeo
That I’m not sure. I purchased my extended warranty while it was still on the factory warranty.,AlfaRomeo
Sorry its my first car and im a rookie to this,AlfaRomeo
Having the tail light split like that looks so good,AlfaRomeo
"Great cars and a MOPAR extended warranty from certain vendors is REALLY CHEAP, I can send you an email of the guy I got my 60k, 4YR warranty from on a giulia",AlfaRomeo
"Absolutely Love the  look of the 164 but don’t love fwd.
I would’ve said the 164 q4 as it’s my dream daily  but it would be close to impossible finding parts for that thing",AlfaRomeo
"The Giulia has aluminum body panels. Impossible to straighten, so must be replaced in case of an accident.",AlfaRomeo
"Looks a bit a ps5 
I like it though!",AlfaRomeo
"The V8s are dead.  Every V8 in the current STLA range will be replaced with the GME-T6 ""Hurricane"" Inline-6.  From RAM, to Jeep, to the Chargers, no more Hemi V8s.",AlfaRomeo
Just got a 2019 gulia with 46k miles for 19k so I’m very happy with the depreciation.,AlfaRomeo
"mine is a 1.6 jtdm, 120 hp. but I know a person who bought the 1.4 turbo petrol engine with 170 horsepower, with the TCT automatic transmission, it is very high-performance and fun, as Alfa Romeo engines in general are very reliable.",AlfaRomeo
Phoenix to Madison around 1400 miles each way.,AlfaRomeo
"Just filled it up, same problem",AlfaRomeo
"Is your stop/start doing its thing? Your commute profile is probably the worst in terms of fuel efficiency, so 21 sounds about right, especially if start/stop isn’t engaging or you have it off.",AlfaRomeo
"Don’t really need to wait for the turbo to build boost on the 2.0 petrol Giulia as peak torque is at 1,900 rpm and totally flat, initially ECU controlled, to about 4,750rpm where torque starts to drop. Gains replacing standard turbo with hybrid are still being developed. I’ve a long way to go with mine.

I do agree that a long stroke engine increases low down torque but, on the flip side and due to piston G forces, must be rev limited earlier than an over-square engine. Long stroke engines, due to piston speed and piston acceleration limits therefore normally being lower revving do tend to lose more energy as heat but the pros and cons of long stroke V over square is a long one especially in a road car.",AlfaRomeo
I will say that I did alot of highway driving with mine and noticed my mpg would drop off noticeably leading up to oil change intervals. Every time I got it serviced it would go right back to normal range.,AlfaRomeo
Awd is the best. Rear bias and AWD when need it.,AlfaRomeo
No it doesn’t. Upgrading the BOV keeps the pressure at a constant level. Reducing lag in the turbo. So to answer your question it doesn’t affect the longevity of the turbo. Unless you are on track. The only thing you have to worry about is a leak due to very high constant pressures. I will probably go with Madness one because it seems to have a lot better reviews,AlfaRomeo
They keep changing options and names for different markets.  It was available on Estrema in 2023 and not available at all as an option in 2022.  Best to look at the Monroney label to see if it is listed on the car you’re looking at then.,AlfaRomeo
1. I don't have that kind of money. 2. I live in the North-East and can't use a RWD lease year round,AlfaRomeo
not sure if you live in America but there are about 50x more dodge chargers on the roads than alfas - and im not exaggerating. charger will sell wayyyy more,AlfaRomeo
My start/stop has randomly come to life twice in my 18 months of ownership… it scared the shit out of me both times when I came to a stop and the engine cut out 😂,AlfaRomeo
Don’t do it. Buying a stelvio was the worst decision of my adult life.,AlfaRomeo
Is the 10k maintenance not included for leases? It is free for purchases.,AlfaRomeo
Your mom.,AlfaRomeo
"T[his youtube vid may be of interest.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLVAHoVOsyM) They're in Australia, but (aside from the obvious) I can't imagine the cars will be *that* much different. Tl;dr: 2020 and up due to various upgrades and well-maintained ones are compelling choices. And most of the issues are electrical.

It was enough to make me mull over finding one.",AlfaRomeo
Damn I always thought giulias averaged mid 30s. Pretty cool though :),AlfaRomeo
What happened? What year?,AlfaRomeo
Living the life!,AlfaRomeo
"So tap it, I guess, if you already tried just wiggling it around a bit",AlfaRomeo
"10 hours in my 2018 Stelvio ti sport. i was beyond shocked how comfortable the ride was. No back pain or fatigue, the stop/go adaptive cruise worked will in the construction zones from northeast to the south. I got 28-29 mpg on the hwy averaging 75mph.",AlfaRomeo
This comment is the only thing cringe here. Also yes Alfas are literally sex on wheels. 🙄,AlfaRomeo
"Is the 2023 the new model or the old one? Either way, I agree, the GT is way overpriced, as is the Grecale. I pondered upgrading from my Stelvio to the Grecale, but I can't justify spending more than Stelvio Quadrifoglio money for a base Grecale. It's asinine.",AlfaRomeo
"Not only that, in Alfas if you for example change cluster or how to say it, if flashes odometer until you put real value (read in multiecuscan for instance). So maybe someone tried to 'lower' the odometer by replacing it, or replaced because something happened. 

Situation is easier if you buy a car, it works OK and then t starts flashing, so you know something happened. Can be blue&me dying, maybe battery needs replacements. 
To op, find alfa guy with cable and computer and try to read some codes, there may be some. And do proxy alignment.",AlfaRomeo
"Wouldn’t that be more due to a car being driven short distances only and not warming up (this is definitely bad for cars in general).

I drove mine for 5,5 years 2017 no problems and was in general gentle with it. Except for the occasional autobahn road trip. Once I made the mistake of hitting the gas when it was cold on a winter day it didn’t like that at all.",AlfaRomeo
"Oh to answer the question it’s probably $1k to get it running, another $1k to make it reliable (brakes etc). Assuming there are no major issues.  

Does it still have the Recaro interior?",AlfaRomeo
What exactly does a quick depreciation mean for a car brand? Other than secondhand models being more affordable,AlfaRomeo
crusty mf,AlfaRomeo
Not where I live,AlfaRomeo
A redline per day keeps the mechanic away,AlfaRomeo

"As I understand it, they’re not really made for everyday driving. Love the design. It looks like an Italian on speed.",AlfaRomeo

Covered till 85K miles at $100/month with a $100 deductible.,AlfaRomeo
"Jags and Alfa are akin in many ways, most people don’t see this",AlfaRomeo
It definitely does. Owners have a Lamborghini Countach kit car and brand new Cadillac. Owned by an old Italian man and his son. John (the dad) started the garage and he works the front desk now. His son Johnny is the one that works on the cars.,AlfaRomeo
You need add those numbers on leasehackr calculator. I think many would ready to lease that right away.,AlfaRomeo
Absolutely agree. Best V8 sound. Great cars btw,AlfaRomeo
Why not? ,AlfaRomeo
"Yes, he’ll provide you with a checklist that you take to an alfa dealer to get the car inspected. It’ll cost around 2-300 most likely.",AlfaRomeo

"Thank you. I do wish there was an easier way of contacting Alfa so I didn’t have to deal with this dealer. When I call Alfa cares, they just tell me that the dealer is the only one that can handle it. Alfa is definitely testing to see what’s going on, which I understand, but I just wanna make sure they test all the areas not just the one on the hood. I really hope they resolve this issue because I love the car but I’m definitely not gonna keep it if this is the stress I have to go through when something goes wrong with it. I will definitely keep everybody updated on what ends up happening.",AlfaRomeo

I just know my salesman told me I could have $60k off MSRP about 2 months ago and even with that, their 2 GranTurismos were not selling, hence the special one-year lease to dump those cars rotting on the showroom floor.  Both cars leased within 15 minutes after getting the call about the special lease deal...one to a guy shopping for a Levante who overhead my salesman describing the deal to me over the phone.  If one needed a car, it was a great deal, although you will get smoked on the excise tax given the $201K MSRP.",AlfaRomeo

"YMMV, but I have the Q4 with the LSD and when they wouldn’t plow my neighborhood during a snowstorm I went out in it and drove tracks around the streets in my neighborhood so cars could get through. It was about 6 inches deep and the Alfa performed marvelously in A mode, I was genuinely impressed.

"If you do go down this path - [AlfaBB forums](http://www.alfabb.com/bb/forums/milano-75-1985-1993/) are your friend. There's so much good content on there over the last 25 years that you'll be able to find out how to do everything written down on there.

The other resource any 75/Milano or GTV6 owner should have permanently saved off is Greg Gordon's long standing guide to the LJet system - it'll pretty much help you tune up and diagnose any issue related to Bosch fuel injection - https://hpsimotorsports.com/blogs/tech-articles/gregs-bosch-l-jetronic-fuel-injection-idle-adjustment-diagnostic-and-tune-up-page

Greg had been a long standing God on the 12V V6, having owned, built and even designed and sold supercharger kits for them over the years.

There's some big expenses in there though, split across mechanicals (engine and gearbox up to speed) and of course body work (rust repair, repairs to front bar, respray). It's the type of job where finding a second parts donor could also be beneficial - you'll probably end up bringing in parts from Europe more than anything.

Good solid project that'd be rewarding though. There's a reason I have new and old Bussos in the garage!",AlfaRomeo
I think OP is puts this on after he parks to save his car from everyone else.,AlfaRomeo
i would take a look at the giulia forums website.  Someone on here may know but I’d say it’s a larger community in general.  You can search and see if this has happened to someone before as it surely has.  Worst case I would post it on there as well,AlfaRomeo
Before you even consider that check the Carfax make sure there’s no history of that being on the Carfax since you recently got it checked out then go to a Dodge dealership and purchase the bumper-to-bumper extended warranty. It’s gonna suck. Wait about a month after your first payment then take it in and get it all fixed for $100 deductible.,AlfaRomeo

"1100 miles (\~1770 km) from North Little Rock AR to Glen Burnie MD in a '74 Spider that was more rust than steel, with a nose that had an inch of body filler covering it. December 1996, I was 28. I couldn't find a job in AR, brother lived in MD, so I pulled up stakes and headed east.

He and his wife had traveled down for the holidays, so they followed me as we drove. I'd bodged up replacing the SPICA pump that summer and had an incessant oil leak that covered my brother's car in oil by the time we made it through Tennessee. The radio didn't work so I had bought a  walkman and some books on tape. The alternator light started flickering not long after we'd passed into Virginia, which triggered a blast of static through the walkman.

We did the entire thing in one go, Probably 17-18 hours total, maybe longer. At the end the alternator light was nearly strobing. The oil pressure light came on just as I pulled into the driveway. I drank a couple of beers and then went to bed.

The SPICA issue was me being an idiot and not putting all the washers under the bolts. The alternator light was a loose wire on the back of the thing. I got all that and more repaired before another idiot move on my part saw a wheel literally fall off in '97. This did damage that more than totaled it.

The longest drive I've done with its replacement, which I have to this day, is two trips from Alexandria VA to Campbell Hall NY, 285 miles and \~ 4.5 hours. Last one was probably 1999. It completed them with a total lack of drama that has been this car's calling card throughout the years.",AlfaRomeo

I absolutely recommend a wheel repair. These guys will even come to you in some cases. They do exceptionally good work and for a lot lesser price in buying a new one. When I worked for Lexus they had a guy who would (full time) fix their wheels. And they looked like a brand new wheel when he was done. Obviously if the rim was really bad it couldn’t be repaired,AlfaRomeo
I bought my quad used from a Ford dealership. they let me take it to an Alfa dealership for inspection.,AlfaRomeo
Very nice color combination,AlfaRomeo
"Depends on the parts you need and if they are back ordered or not. My Alfa mechanic had to replace my starter relay and they were on back order for a week but he was able to make a few calls to other Alfa dealerships and got one for my car in two days. Today I took my car in for throwing a check engine light after I drove it with one line of fuel left and he was telling me about a giulia they have needing a replacement engine and that the owner has to wait a month for it to come in. The giulia is a great car though and with good maintenance comes great rides. I’ve only had one minor issue with mine being the starter relay and she’s been good to me. The driving experience is also amazing especially on dynamic mode, takes corners like a beast and the braking is so smooth and precise. I also love to little growls my giulia makes when I accelerate.",AlfaRomeo
"Common issue causing this is low battery, probably easiest thing to try.",AlfaRomeo
"2 years old only requires minor yearly services. 2 years factory warranty will give u piece of mind. a fresh battery would be nice. make sure everything works as expected. id check little things like auto start/stop and the active aero.

Without any issues ?  21 miles.,AlfaRomeo
"Great write up. You're absolutely right that there's some additional changes but they are numerous and some matter more than others. 

2022 swapped the QV's standard heated alcantara sport seats for the perforated leather Veloce seats. I really liked the alcantara seats, good bolstering and the alcantara was grippy enough for spirited driving. The veloce perforated leather seats are still good, don't get me wrong, but they're more lux than sport.

Lots of changes to specific functionality of the infotainment and driver assistance package features year by year, prospective buyers should make sure to check that the car they're looking at has all the features they want.",AlfaRomeo

Veloce didn't exist at all in 2018.  Trim levels according to my 2018 model changes sheet from when I ordered are:  Base Sport, Ti Sport & Ti Lusso.

I owned a 2020 Outback XT and hated it. The CVT shifted horrendously, the infotainment screen is awful and freezes all the damn time. It doesn’t help that they put HVAC controls in it. And the build quality is subpar. Headlight clearcoat peeled, plastic cladding sun dried easily, etc. I detail my cars extensively and couldn’t prevent these.

"There's never been a confirmed case of engine failure due to LSPI on the GME 2.0L.  There was a ""tear down"" on the GiuliaForums where the halfwit internet amoeba's declared failure was due to the wrong oil and resulting LSPI, and while it was an LSPI failure there was a foreign substance introduced into the combustion chamber that wasn't from the oil.  They neglected to realize that the copper anti-seize someone had used on the plugs has a petroleoum grease base that is anywhere from 15-30% calcium AND the copper particulate content may have acted to helped initiate the LSPI by providing a thermal hot spot.

Remember this engine was developed in Europe, with 1000s of real world driving cycles and controlled dyno cycles (all with sensors beyond what is in the car - including real-time cylinder pressure sensos), and then tear down inspections to check for wear.  The recommended European oil never changed either, and still no LSPI fears in Europe.

No reason to do 5K oil changes unless you consider your use ""severe"", but it won't hurt.  I certainly wouldn't do oil changes more frequently than 5k, as modern oils are specifically formulated for extended drains  with high detergent loads and you don't want the very aggressive detergent packages cleansing the A/W additives from the component surfaces.  For the average user, 5K oil changes are a bit early.  Alfa wouldn't have recommended a maximum of 10K miles if that was insufficient, they have more data than anyone, especially much more than internet randos.",AlfaRomeo

I agree with above. The tape they give you either is trash or they don’t put on enough. Use the adhesive promoter and make sure the tape is nice and warm when u put it on. Those are the best suggestions I can give. I have that same V cover in my Amazon inbox I just haven’t pulled the trigger yet lol. It’s still too cold where I am in Massachusetts. I also purchased the inner door hinge covers in metallic black. I just haven’t put them on yet. But I did remove the tape they came with and replaced it with gorilla tape double side? I believe.

That said, if all you wanted was a beater that literally nobody else will be driving around in you could do a lot worse. Change all the fluids, put in a new battery, and drive it until it breaks something expensive. Then it's on to the next one.

Both are valid ways to enjoy classic cars.

"Ok, I’m just gonna assume it’s fixed then lol. Serves me right for not tightening gas cap. Guess I learned my lesson lol. My timing was super bad for this tho lol",AlfaRomeo
I feel ya. I have no idea what happened to mine as it was previous owner but I know the tires were replaced at the same time… if it’s a deep ish scrape they can fill it and the results if done well are not noticeable…. Usually they’ll give free quotes and tell you if they are repairable or not.,AlfaRomeo
It seems not,AlfaRomeo
Yes. Then after weak tree fall over and now i have dent on roof.,AlfaRomeo
"You need to take it in, it needs a new assembly. Hopefully you have warranty!",AlfaRomeo
Can vouch for this. Proud owner of a new Giulia and it is expensive to insure here in Australia,AlfaRomeo
Thanks a lot for the thorough explanation!,AlfaRomeo
"It’s my daily, though my commute is 22 miles round trip. Handling is fantastic - but you’ve probably read about the tramlining. This is resolved through front suspension blocks and different tires than the OEM P Zero. 

Speaking of tires, the P Zero is the only pair that officially fits the car. A lot us owners swap to a +10 width front and rear to open the selection up greatly (and help tramlining as noted above). 

Lack of power steering sucks when parking, especially in reverse. Otherwise you don’t notice it.

Seats have to be taken out of the car to be fully adjusted, but it’s 4 bolts and unclipping 2 harness wires. Pretty easy and makes a potential significant difference in comfort. 

Last thing to note: either “basic” OEM exhaust can drone pretty decent. The later Akrapovič option is valved and changes depending on drive mode. Hard to find though and $$$. I have a Sector 111 straight piped exhaust with a Helmholtz chamber that kills ALL the drone and sounds incredible. It is unfortunately out of production. 

All this said, the car by most takes is love or hate. No real in between. I happen to be one of the lovers and will never get rid of it unless a spider comes along… maybe.

Edit: I’m in Southern California. Makes driving as a daily fairly easy and my short commute is against traffic. She’s fun in the rain and Dynamic mode. Rear will step out nicely and slide pretty good until the eased up stability control kicks in juuuuust at the right time.",AlfaRomeo
Im not really good at explainig but check this link.  https://www.alfaowner.com/threads/window-regulator-replacement.330218/,AlfaRomeo
What a freaking beauty!!,AlfaRomeo
Stunning!,AlfaRomeo
"Yes it does have a knocking sound, when doing that, or even just tapping and letting go off the gas. Think it's just the locking center diff, I'm not too bothered 😁",AlfaRomeo
I can tell you from experience that the Alfa is a lot more comfortable than a Subaru.,AlfaRomeo
"Not big on browns, golds, and beiges. They quickly make cars look old.",AlfaRomeo
NY to Virginia and back.,AlfaRomeo
"Tempe, AZ to Kennewick, WA. 1,218 miles. It was 119 degrees in Phoneix when I left and 85 when I got home. Car took it all like a champ. 2022 Giulia Quadrifoglio.",AlfaRomeo
Thank you!!,AlfaRomeo
50k miles with no issues,AlfaRomeo
Mine needed to have the whole roof panel replaced. Same issue.,AlfaRomeo
Would you mind sharing why?,AlfaRomeo
Family of my friends drove to the alfa romeo museum and other parts of italy from finland so ~1900km but like stopped to sleep and ferries etc,AlfaRomeo
I want a boxer engined alfa so bad,AlfaRomeo
"Деветка, још Q4. Топина.",AlfaRomeo
"Completely, plus you also have to deal with the idiotic central touch screen that controls just about everything, plus electric inside door openers…perhaps the dumbest thing ever to electrify.  It crazy that Maserati is charging nearly $30k more for what is essentially a base Stelvio with a very minor ECU tune, plus it looks extremely feminine.  Huge discounts coming to Grecales soon too.  After the initial new car launch sales interest, they too are now are dead.  One part of me thinks Stellantis is just discontinuing the Stelvio QV just to drive sales to the significantly more expensive Grecale Trofeo but that is going to back fire on them bigtime.",AlfaRomeo
Very cool!,AlfaRomeo
Likely 40 warm ups.,AlfaRomeo
"Sold it, broke my heart. Costing too much for the upkeep.",AlfaRomeo
in imaginary land :(,AlfaRomeo
What is that beaver looking shit. This will kill their brand if that's what it looks like.,AlfaRomeo
That’s beautiful! Nice new ride and congrats OP!!💪🏻,AlfaRomeo
"Yeah, I was stupid and didn't make a video, but the above commenter sent a video with the exact same sound.",AlfaRomeo
Mostly for fun.,AlfaRomeo
"Make sure to take it to the dealership to get an inspection under warranty. My stelvio had a fuel leak ( no warranty), and it was 5k... I am not rich",AlfaRomeo
"572 miles

419 miles is the 2nd longest, that was the drive home after purchasing it 👍",AlfaRomeo
"I don’t know tbh, watch YouTube there is some video’s",AlfaRomeo
Has this been shared before?,AlfaRomeo
"You can purchase a MVP plan (MOPAR Vehicle Protection) before or after the original warranty expires. 

If you purchase while still under the factory warranty the years/mileage is based on original vehicle in-service date and total milage. So 8yr/100k is 8 years from original in-service date and 100k total miles.

Purchased out of warranty you may need to have the vehicle inspected for preexisting issues and the years/mileage is based on the date of warranty purchase and current mileage of the vehicle. Purchased on a 5 year old car with 30k miles a 4yr/60k plan would run 4 years from the date the warranty is purchased and up to 90k miles.

Definitely worth it.",AlfaRomeo
Thanks for sharing. Sounds brutal. I hope it didn’t result in you becoming single,AlfaRomeo
😢😭😭😫,AlfaRomeo
"My giulia is on the same boat, its in the shop at the moment for a front bumper replacement and my current estimate is about $1400. Heres the tricky part, the shop found out yesterday that there's 3 air vents glued on to the front bumper which they cant reuse. So now they have placed an order for the airvents which will probably increase my estimate, and of course one of the airvents is a month in back order. I will report back once I have the final damage",AlfaRomeo
"All you gotta do is look at how rappers glorify Hellcats or Demons. You never see a rapper naming their songs after a Giulia, RCFs, or Caymans.

Idk how it got that way in the first place but it's definitely a thing for Dodges to be stereotypical status symbols in poorer communities. Just like patek watches and shit.",AlfaRomeo
Apparently it was originally going to be an Alfa but was changed early in the development.,AlfaRomeo
