"When you say Sharper curves, can you give an example? For the most part I'm not hugely concerned about the curves, because I'm traveling on 22 and I99 in PA, which is mostly a straight shot.

My 2018 Giulia has Apple Carplay.  Mid to late 2018 builds should have it.  Best to confirm with the dealer if it actually has it.  Connecting an iPhone via usb cable under the A/C controls should show if it has it or not on the screen.  Prices will vary widely with how the car was originally spec‚Äôed.

"It's a fine car. The 2.0 JTS is the best petrol engine for that car. Fuel consumption is 7-8l/100km. Front suspension needs parts every other year, and handbrake wires rust and freeze but they are cheap and fairly easy to change. Stick to maintenance schedule and change oil regularly. Check for the last cambelt change, as it should be done every 3 years.

I first started tuning it was considered 20m / second.

But high piston speed means you‚Äôve also got to decelerate and accelerate those pistons importing huge loads. I‚Äôve seen vehicles where unknowing tuners have lifted the Rev limit leading to stretched rods and big end bolts. It is not only max piston speed.",AlfaRomeo

"CORRECTION: This is an ‚Äò82

Also a bit of history: I‚Äôm friends with the owner, and he can‚Äôt drive the car any more. He was never terribly mechanically inclined, but the car ran well when I drove it last year. When I tried to move it this year, battery was dead (as expected). I swapped it out, but it wouldn‚Äôt turn over (I could hear a little thunk, but it was feint when I tried to get it going). It needs a new parking brake (the old one is siezed), some transmission work (usually won‚Äôt fall into reverse), and I‚Äôm sure more (definitely needs all fluids changed, etc).",AlfaRomeo

"The upper intake on the driver side is for the intercooler, the lower intake on the driver side cools the transmission. The upper (only) intake on the passenger side is air intake for the engine as well as a duct to cool the turbo area of the engine bay. I believe that the transmission duct was added for the North American cars and might not be on the European models. Maybe they learned that this was a failure point and fixed before releasing to North America. Maybe it is because the NA cars are heavier, not sure.",AlfaRomeo

How much would that cost?,AlfaRomeo

"It‚Äôs actually pretty good, I chose a 21 because it‚Äôs still got a good amount of life on the factory warranty but you could get an older cpo or with the mopar warranty if you‚Äôre too concerned. I‚Äôve had this car for about 7-8 months now and I‚Äôve only had two issues. I gas a check engine light for an emissions code which ended up being a vapor canister, fairly quick fix.

"Few reasons NOT to get an Outback:

- You‚Äôre a man

- You‚Äôre not a women that likes other women

- Do you go into Walmart and choose whatever clothes fit, just because they fit? No. You select clothes that fit your personality, body, activity, etc. Same goes for buying a car!!

- most importantly, they cost the same‚Ä¶ like, how could you still want something less luxurious, less sporty, less pretty, less feature loaded, for the same price?? Don‚Äôt come at me with ‚Äúreliability‚Äù, my Subaru was the most dogshit car I‚Äôve ever owned. Now, I did own a 2006 Impreza WRX with the EJ255 motor (motors now are FA20 or FA22 or FA25) but they‚Äôre equally unreliable, just in their own ways.

I spent about $4100 keeping my Subaru running over the course of 14 months.

"I bought a new stelvio qv 2 years ago, very happy with it with it. Quality is fine, inside and out. Controls are logical, convenient and easy to use, drives well, fast as hell, sport/race mode transforms it into a very quick car, it handles too. Wife has new cayenne hybrid, it‚Äôs quick, comfortable, well built and quite soulless, I prefer my stelvio. I don‚Äôt like the auto stop/start (turn it off) or the nanny state seatbelt warning chime, the parking sensors can be a little enthusiastic, surround cameras would be nice, but these are very minor criticisms I‚Äôm struggling for. 

If they did a slightly bigger car with a v8 I‚Äôd buy it tomorrow. I suppose the closest to that is a Maserati Levante trofeo, which I am currently considering buying. I take your point about common criticism of the Levante, I‚Äôve driven a few and I don‚Äôt see what people are complaining about. Maybe they haven‚Äôt actually driven one themselves?  The problem with the competition from Audi/BMW/Porsche/Mercedes and a couple more also rans is, well, they‚Äôre mostly just a bit too German for my taste. Porsche dealers are best of a dreadful bunch, everyone else is a bit rubbish compared to that and my Alfa dealer really wasn‚Äôt the best.

Sorry for rambling!",AlfaRomeo

"That‚Äôs awesome dude! I‚Äôm 24 now and sold my Alfa, regrettably. They‚Äôre great vehicles so long as you treat them right. I just hope this economy starts turning around soon. Lots of folks aren‚Äôt understanding the concept of money and living within their financial means, so inflation will keep climbing so long as folks keep thinking they can live outside their means. Price of something is high? Too bad, people are going in debt for it. What does that mean? The price was never too high, because folks are buying it. If it was too high, nobody would buy it. I swear America is becoming a ‚Äúlook at me‚Äù competition. Gotta have all the Gucci, the g wagon, the private school, the fancy lunches, etc. inflation is going nowhere if people keep spending like money ain‚Äôt worth a damn.

"I just bought a 2020 Stelvio, out of state for the first time and had it shipped to me. This is what I did.

Call the dealer with the car and ask them about it. Ask them if there are any known issues either mechanical or cosmetic that don't appear in photos.  Most people will mention things.

Ask the dealer to provide a total out the door quote (not including transport) that includes all required fees and no optional ones. Assuming you're okay with that, proceed. 

Tell the dealer that you need to have it inspected at a mechanic nearby. They should be willing to drop it off there and pick it up after. If they say no, walk away. Find a well rated mechanic on Yelp nearby. Call them, ask them if they do prepurchase inspections and if so, what they do. Good ones that do these regularly have a checklist and will provide a report, sometimes with photos. Tell them you're out of state so that they note things that might be obvious in person but missed in photos esp things like included accessories (spare tire, 2 key fobs etc). After you get the report, talk to the mechanic and ask them what they think about the car. Again, there might be things not mentioned in the report. If the inspection is good proceed.

Tell the dealer you'd like to move forward. Most should let you pay a few thousand on a credit card as a deposit while they wait for a cashier's checks. They will send you paperwork to sign, and you will send the check. Once the check is received and cleared it's yours. This was done via FedEx overnight by my dealer. 

I arranged my own transport using Josh at Beamautotransport who is a broker. You can call him to get an estimate before he will not begin arranging transport until the dealer confirms the car is all good to be picked up. If you're having it transported enclosed, now's a good time to ask the dealer to have it washed for you so that when it arrives, you can confirm the condition matches the listing photos. I paid $1,000 to have it shipped 800 miles enclosed. Was supposed to be delivered in 24 hours but weather delayed it and it took about 48 hours. Waiting for and watching your new (to you) car roll out of the trailer is the best feeling ever.

 Enjoy!

For Mopar warranty, if you buy it when it still has its factory warranty it does not need to be inspected. You don't need to purchase before 36K miles but I believe the price increases after 36k miles (also 12K, 24K too).",AlfaRomeo

"The two things that were unexpected for me were the high cost of service and the high cost of insurance. Oil changes at the dealer are over $600 in my area and an independent shop can‚Äôt do them much cheaper because the filter is $250 from the dealer. There are some alternatives but they require ordering the oil and filter online yourself. Also, most people report that the serpentine belt service is in the 3-4k range. That needs to be done every 4 years and requires the front end to be disassembled.¬†

Insurance is also quite expensive. Most insurers quoted me over $300 a month despite a clean record. I was able to find one insurer that covered the car for a more reasonable amount.¬†",AlfaRomeo

"Tires could be fine. But it could be a slight imperfection in a rim. Meaning hitting something like a pot hole or curb. I used to work at a few dealerships. And sometimes you would not feel a vibration until you reach higher speeds where the wheels are spinning faster. At those speeds to me it seems like a slight bend to a wheel most likely the front but could be the rear. But if you are feeling it by the rear view mirror that would be my guess. They can also do what is called a road force balance on tires. (Where they don‚Äôt just balance them but actually put force on the tire while balancing) you could try that. Also I would take a look at each rim very carefully. Even on the inner side. Look for slight scratches,imperfections. That could be a sign of a bent wheel. Just my thoughts. Also could be a wheel bearing but that was when I worked on Lexus and Toyota",AlfaRomeo

If it something you can afford to do up, or renovate, or have the resources and skills to undertake then yeah; do it. If you can not afford to buy a working car, then I am merely suggesting that you would find it much more expensive to make a non-running car work.

If the car start, runs, and most importantly, has good brakes, then take a punt. But no one can tell you how much it will cost 'to make it run' from four photographs.

Reddit can not answer this for you without a lot more info. Whats up with the engine, what condition are the brakes in, are you going to repaint it, is the body work intact, is the exhaust rusty, are the shock done etc.

"Done loads these.   

Getting the old one off is a walk in the park.   4 bolts on the mounting, big bolt under the spring and the ball joint.   Ta-dah, what‚Äôs so hard?   Er, getting the 4 bolts back on the subframe is impossible with all of the rest of it assembled.    Eventually you get pissed off and cross thread them, ruining the arm. 

First up, do you have a decent arm?    Delphi, OEM, Birth.   The cheap eBay ones break as you lower the car onto them and will be knocking again in 200 miles.

The trick with fitting these is to get as much of the suspension out of the way as possible.   With nothing pressing on them, they bolt up easily.   As soon as they are under load - impossible.

1) Disconnect the ARB on both sides.

2) You could undo the axle nut and swing the whole lot out of the way, but you don‚Äòt want to do that.   

3) I‚Äôd unbolt the strut from inside the engine bay and pull the whole lot out - 4 nuts and you can change the upper arm while you have it in front of you.  Use a jack toget the hub up and out of the way, then put the lower arm in.",AlfaRomeo

"I'm going to have to disagree with the other guy even though he is well informed in general.

I think it's a TI Sport, not a base Sport based on the black trim on the front of the car and the rear diffuser.

The base model doesn't have black trim on the front between the two main air intakes. The base model looks like [this](https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/oem/2017_alfa-romeo_giulia_sedan_base_fq_oem_8_1600x1067.jpg) from the front.

The base model also does not have a diffuser like the car in the pictures does. [This](https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/oem/2017_alfa-romeo_giulia_sedan_base_rq_oem_6_1600x1067.jpg) is the rear of a base model.

I do think it's a Ti Sport because of the sport seats.

The only odd thing is the lack of the 19"" five-hole wheels, but I think those may have been options on the Ti Sport, not automatic inclusions- I could be wrong on this.

The Veloce badging on the side is not stock as the Veloce name didn't exist in North America in 2018, but it can be forgiven because in Europe, the 2018 Ti Sport was literally called a veloce and it *did* have that badging.",AlfaRomeo

Really, I think it comes down to how the car will be used. If it‚Äôs just a grocery getter in town and generally the weather is nice, I‚Äôd say the Alfa is a good choice (provided it‚Äôs in good shape). If the weather sucks in your area or you intend on driving it on unimproved roads, get the Subaru. If you‚Äôre following someone down a gravel road and a rock pops up and hits your hood, you‚Äôll be bummed in the Subaru but would probably absolutely freak out in the Alfa. 

Plus I‚Äôd choose the AWD system in the Subaru in bad weather. The RWD based one in the Alfa is great for performance driving, but any non full time AWD system won‚Äôt perform in the snow as well as a Subaru/Audi system.",AlfaRomeo

"So I had a MAP tune on the WRX, but no other mods.  MAP tune tried to fix the torque dip in the WRX, and did an okay job of it. 
 But even so, Giulia 2.0 (mine is AWD) is better in every way.  Significantly quicker due to both the power curve and also the 8 speed gearbox.  Comfort, noise, infotainment etc is literally a class above. Unless you're going to be doing track days or plan to be driving at *very* illegal speeds, no need for the quad.  2.0 will still be over the speed limit and then some by the end of the on ramp. I will say, get a 2021 or later 2.0, make sure it's the sport seats, get the paddles, and I think you'll be happy.  2021 or later because warranty, and full carplay/AA.  It's a reliable car (QV is *not*), but people with these on lease tended to drive them sparingly.  Mine is a 2020 with 20k miles on it.

For example, when driving on the outside lane of a freeway, highway assist will cancel at an approaching offramp, even though the left-hand lane marker is still perfectly visible. It also tends to lose the score on curves that are less than gentle. Even driving on some older freeways like I-5 in Los Angeles, the design of the freeway is more than the system can handle at speed. I‚Äôve also noticed it is sensitive to the angle of the sun in the sky and how it seems to screw with the camera mounted near the interior rearview mirror.

"hello, I bought my first Alfa last year in September, it is MiTo from 2009 and only problems that occurred were normal things that you just have to do from time to time. I personally changed a few things, but it was not necessary, it was just for my good feeling, here in Europe there is big propaganda about unreliability but I just liked that model so I bought it. If you buy it from someone who made some maintenance then it will probably be good buy. There is nothing to worry about. Only problems with alfas are electronic things that are almost every time easy and cheap to fix. And maybe it is not the best brand in reliability (for example Mercedes isn't as well) but it is very very very fun to drive, there always was something about Italian cars that is just awesome, so I would say you will be very happy if you buy it.

This is a high compression turbocharged engine with direct injection and LSPI can damage the engine almost immediately.

"I went from a pretty well built (custom EJ257, 6MT, spiider DCCD etc) 2004 WRX wagon to my first Giulia QV. No comparison other than they were both fast. The overall refinement and ride quality of the giulia is lightyears ahead of a WRX. Steering in the Giulia is light and quick, with surprisingly good feedback. Braking at speed is excellent, but parking lot creeping is always an adventure. Had iron and CCM braked QVs and they're both jerky at parking lot speeds. Dropping to N mode helps soften the torque converter's aggressiveness. I drive 90% D, 8% R, 2% N. Bumped into A one time and thought something was broken. 

Giulia infotainment has always been a weak point, and is generally comparable with cars 5 years older.

"I do pretty much most of my own work. I also wrench on my other vehicles (2x BMWs, a Mercedes-Benz, and a MINI Cooper S) and I would say comparatively speaking these vehicles are actually pretty easy to work on. 

You'll definitely need an E-Torx and T-Torx bit set, low and high torque wrenches (ideally in Nm, but foot-lbs works too), and a standard socket wrench kit/set. I also recommend a deep socket set as well as various extensions, it will make certain jobs light-years easier and more convenient. For spark plugs, you'll need a thin wall spark plug socket. 

For diagnostics I use Multiecuscan. 

Parts can be a little annoying. I found a few retailers online that sell reliable parts for these vehicles, for everything else I usually have to go through the dealership (which is a couple hours away).

"The Model S i quite a bit larger and will be quicker in a straight line. Most likely it will be cheaper to fuel If you have a charger at home. The Alfa is a more sporty drive, has a nicer interior and will have a longer range and be quicker to refuel. These are very different cars though, and not something you‚Äôd usually be cross shopping.

My guess is also that the Alfa will be more reliable (not every day you can say that). The Model S has issues with almost every part that isn‚Äôt the Mercedes switchgear. Rear control arms, most of the AC system, air suspension, wiper linkage, middle brake light and door handles are common familier points. Early models had a good few issues with the drive units, and some also had battery failures. Those are several thousand dollars for the parts alone. 

Putting my heavy Alfa bias aside: I‚Äôm not anti EV or particularly anti-Tesla. They‚Äôre really damn quick, and I‚Äôve enjoyed driving a few of them in the past, but I would never buy a Model S out of warranty. That car has a high likelyhood of becoming very expensive very quickly. If you‚Äôre going the Tesla route, buy a newer Model 3.",AlfaRomeo

"I didn't know where the OP was initially, but then I looked up the dealer based on the license plate surround URL in the photos, and it appears he is in the UAE.  So Veloce trim may have existed at the time in the EMEA disribution / sales region that covers UAE.

In the USA, you could get a Sport Package that would add the front and rear sport facias to the base Giulia.  But as you stated, the sport seats pretty much make it a Ti Sport because they were only available on the Ti Sport.  

Anyway, I found this yesterday trying to dig around for my documents on when I built and ordered my 2018 Giulia.  This Alfa Romeo USA PDF gives much more detail on available equipment and options in 2018:

Small changes that I'm sure are noticeable, but it's not like going 2019 or before, with the old infotainment. There is a new infotainment, but it's a much smaller jump, and since you'll be in AA/CarPlay most of the time anyway the only difference really is the screen brightness, which I've had no issues with.

"Used at street temps CCBs will last an extremely long time compared to iron rotors. I wouldn't worry about it on a Stelvio, less likely to see track time than a Giulia. 

Should easily last 80-100k miles. There are iron replacements available from Girodisc for about a quarter the price of the CCBs if you have it that long.


I wouldn't plan on getting the carbon ceramic rotors 'refurbished'. Not even sure how that would work, they're cast/molded and baked as a single piece and are replaced based on a minimum weight (in terms of wear). 

Have CCB's on my Giulia. They don't produce dust and stop extremely well. Except when the discs are wet, so be mindful of that first stop after a carwash.

Owning both a Subaru and an Alfa Romeo (though different models and manufacturing years) myself, Subaru is a pleasure to work on yourself, while trying to disassemble something on the Alfa makes you want to poke your eyes out with any tool at hand, when you see how much unnecessary effort you'll need to put in for the smallest maintenance tasks üòÖ",AlfaRomeo
Did you turn the fans all the way up? Not sure cuz I bought mine in November of last year so I haven‚Äôt used the AC yet. But it could also be a low charge on the AC refrigerant. I‚Äôm not extremely experienced with Alfas yet but I am with other vehicles. I‚Äôve seen cars on low refrigerant be slow to cooling down. Alfas seem to be a different breed when it comes to technology. I tried the AC when I bought it to make sure it works but for some reason it would only be like an auto option. As in maybe it‚Äôs not meant to blow extreme air flow but to cool it down to a comfortable temp. Maybe if the interior was warmer the fans might blow harder.

"You're really misinformed and under-informed and shouldn't continue commenting.

It isn't G forces that manufacturers are concerned about it with long stroke CONSUMER engines.  We (I've been a Powertrain Engineer for 2 decades) care about the inertial loading of the piston and rod (and rod bearing) more in race applications, where we're trying to get rid of all excess mass and it is a balancing act between required strength and mass reduction that define our limits.  Adding 50g due to increasing the cross section of a connecting rod beam, isn't really an issue for the OEM, whatever it needs to be it needs to be.  The OEMs care more about the wear rate of the cylinder bore, rings, piston skirt, due to the high surface speeds and side loading that comes with longer strokes used at higher RPM levels.  25 m/s used to be the typical accepted limit for piston ring (stability), although you've got some very high end motorsport applications now exceeding that.

I suspect that rev limit on the GME 2.0L isn't specifically a limit of the bottom end, but likely more a of a practical limit due to where peak power occurs.  Valvetrain stability is likely the real limit for higher RPMs on this engine.  

You should go back and correct your other post and remove the erroneous information relating to crankshaft heat treatment and piston production process.  You wouldn't want to irresponsibly continue misinforming others, as you have become misinformed yourself.",AlfaRomeo

Second one is a 22. So far so good more or less. Still under warranty, so not overly concerned at the moment. Don‚Äôt have paddles, which I miss, so recommend getting a car with them, they are a pain to install on your own and takes not insignificant money and time and handiness. 

Look up if there are any Alfa certified mechanics who can perform warranty repair near you. Dealers will charge you more per hour. You may be able to get maintenance done at a dodge/jeep/chrysler but don‚Äôt bank on it. Diligent about maintenance, do oil changes more than every 10k.

"Stelvio has its quirks-  steering radius isnt as sharp/tight as the bmw, but the steering rack/feel more than make up for the amazing handling

Overall its got some quirks- annoying start/stop function, the reverse camera in the 17-20 stelvios is  terrible(typical dodge), i assume they updated that on the 2021+ models

Maintenance isnt complicatef as long as you keep up with it, and change the oem battery to a better one down the road to avoid weird electrical faults.

The electric door openers from the Fiat 500 are kinda hilarious though. I like how the Grecale looks, but I just can't justify that price. Equivalent engine options in my country are about twice as much as the Stelvio, which makes the base model the same price as the Stelvio Quad, the 330HP model is a bit more expensive, while for the price of a Trofeo you could buy 2 Stelvio Quads. The Quads will remain on sale in Europe AFAIK, so I guess that's a consolation, but I can't help feeling like Stellantis is running these amazing brands into the ground. Again.

"Yep, the rev hang was another thing the MAP tune did well lol. That and the linear throttle.  Basically made it the way it should have been from factory IMO, never noticed any power gains, but that wasn't the point.  I had the MAP tune on it as a daily for 7 years, 60k miles until I sold it.  Only had the numbers up for the first month or so until I was satisfied it was running smooth.  AP stayed in my desk drawer after that.  Another thing about the QV is that you'll be giving up comfort and fuel mileage, and insurance will probably be double lol.  To be totally honest, 'cool' should never factor into any decision a person makes.  Either you want something for specific reasons, or you don't, and what you really want is turning heads or whatever, ya know? While I think the QV is very cool, I don't want it *because* it's cool, I want one because it's a beautiful car with a great engine etc.  But one, I can't even come close to affording it and two, I need AWD for snowy mountain passes.  I'd say, go test drive the following: A4/A5, Giulia 2.0, and if you want a comparison point, an M340 or S4/S5.  IMO, those cars are all the power anyone could ever need in a daily.  My friend with an M340 calls it 'zero to jail before you realize what the number is'.  The C43 is also an option, but you'll give up some comfort and build quality compared to the others, even the Alfa.  C43 and S4/S5 can be easily tuned later to 450 bhp supposedly with just a stage 1, if more is wanted.  I was originally shopping for one of the German 3, but a few things swayed me.  One was price and mileage.  One non-negotiable IMO should be AA/CarPlay.  Don't get infotainment that's already outdated lol.  To get new enough versions (the refresh for the C43 and S5), the cost was high.  A5 I wrote off because the steering was wayyyyyyy too light and lifeless.  In the end I got a 2020 Giulia ti Sport in the second best color with only 20k miles for $34k, while a german 2.0with 20k miles would have set me back $35k+, and the S4/M340/C43 were at least $45k.",AlfaRomeo
"It started showing up last year. So I feel like even though that is early for clear coat breakdown since it's not supposed to break down at any point, it still had some miles on it.

"Here‚Äôs a write up I did that details changes by MY: 

‚Äò17- No CarPlay or Android auto. Electronics can be finicky but this can usu. be solved with a software update. Or two.

‚Äò18- Suspension was raised- many think too high. AAPL CarPlay was added.

‚Äò19- Suspension returned to ~2017 height. Rear seats fold. Last year for direct injection only engine. Steering wheel is thinner on ‚Äò17-‚Äò19 and interior is slightly more chintzy (esp. the plastic around the shift knob.) Steering feel and overall performance driving experience is superior on ‚Äò17-‚Äò19 MYs to later models‚Ä¶ but reliability is lower on average and interior quality is inferior. I believe this was the last year that the grill liner (?) thingy was a polished silver color- it later became black.

‚Äò20-‚Äò21- Interior refresh (compare pics using Google- top of my head: shift knob improved as did the center console- esp. around shift knob, it no longer can be started in dynamic so no more awesome cold starts, dials are now metal/feel nicer, wireless charging introduced)

More importantly, the engine architecture also changed to port and direct injection in ‚Äò20, preventing carbon build up. Infotainment became touch screen at some point and added neat performance readings. More sound insulation and thicker windows. Autonomous driving introduced as an option.

Lastly, they revised the steering geometry in ‚Äò20 to prevent ‚Äúunrefined‚Äù wheel hop when turning wheel full lock at very low speeds. Wish they had kept it the same bc it took away 10% of its litheness (per my subjective impression in having owned a ‚Äò19 and moving to a ‚Äò23.)

‚Äò22-‚Äò23 Same as ‚Äò20-‚Äò21 except they did away with standard carbon fiber roof. It had to be optioned as exposed CF (prior to this, if you didn‚Äôt option exposed CF, it was still painted carbon.) Pretty lame that they did away w/ std. CF roof without mentioning it. I magnet tested my 2023‚Ä¶ yep, it‚Äôs metal.

‚Äò24- The 2024 has a revised headlight design- they‚Äôre LEDs now. The taillights are also slightly different, and are more ‚Äútinted‚Äù/smoky. The carbon fiber adorning the center console is now a naked basket weave as opposed to the more traditional, glossy CF. You can feel the texture of it on the ‚Äò24. Lastly, the gauge cluster is digital as opposed to analog and the LSD is mechanical (e-diff was ‚Äò17-‚Äò23.)

I should note that certain trims/options were eliminated over time; certain stitching (like red or green and white), brake caliper colors (yellow calipers were once an option), carbon ceramic brake option, and certain exterior color options, went away (however‚Ä¶ one exterior paint color was added: Ocra.) Bright (silver) rims went away at some point too. Not going to get into the purely aesthetic option changes by MY bc they‚Äôre too numerous and I‚Äôm lazy. You can no longer option carbon bucket seats (not sure exactly when they were discontinued), and manuals stopped being offered in certain ex-US countries in 2019. (Lost in 2020 refresh.) Oh, and at some point the Quadrifoglio badge became plastic instead of aluminum.

Tl;dr- ‚Äò17-19 drove better and felt lighter (I sold my 2019 for a 2023.) ‚Äò20+ are more refined, reliable, and technologically-advanced. Quality is improved at the expense of reduced customization.

Please don‚Äôt take this as gospel but I‚Äôm 90% sure it‚Äôs all accurate. As mentioned, I have direct experience with 2019, 2023, and 2024‚Ä¶ drove all 3.

Then the windows stopped rolling down because of the faulty temperature sensor in the passenger side mirror. Then the headlamp switch went bad and would randomly turn my headlights off when it was pitch black out. Now my passenger side doors do not lock or unlock, and the oil pump just went out on my car. It‚Äôs truly been a nightmare. My warranty has saved me many times, but I live an hour and a half away from a dealer so it‚Äôs a struggle trying to actually get the car up there.

In terms of fuel economy 1.9 is not great either. It's heavy car. 2.4 as businessYoung said have cracking cylinder head, which you can avoid by putting (or after it will crack) cylinder head from 166 if i am not mistaken. In breras with 210hp version it was fixed iirc (they also had 2.4 diesel).

First serious response. The Outback will definitely be more reliable and you will have less problems with it than the Stelvio. That being said. The Stelvio will drive like a dream. The handling and agility on those is insane. Now if you are planning to state a family with her her in the future then obviously go for the Outback as it‚Äôs a better family car but if you have no plans for a family anytime soon then I‚Äôd suggest the Stelvio.

They both have adequate seat room in the back, and surprisingly I think the GT has more leg room.

If the dealer and Alfa were acting better about the situation, it would be different, but they don‚Äôt seem to be moving urgently to fix it.

The only other advice I can share is to ultimately switch from the Pirelli P-Zeros to the Michelin Pilot Sport 4S when you need new tires.

"This engine is very tough and designed to be used hard though not doing so won‚Äôt hurt it. 

Crank is forged, nitrided and has superfinished journal surfaces.
Pistons are forged and underside of crown is oil cooled from oil squirters in the block.

Biggest two risks with this engine are:-

1) it uses the MultiAir system so correct and frequent oil changes are critical. Read up on the correct spec oil and be 100% certain it is used at every oil change.

2) it is direct injection so your intake ports will eventually carbon up. To help prevent that it would be best to fit an oil catch can and not feed the oil / air fumes back into the engine to be burnt.

Also, and oddly for a modern engine, it is ‚Äúlong stroke‚Äù engine, meaning the stroke is longer than the bore diameter.",AlfaRomeo

"Most cars in the class of car the Giulia and Stelvio are in are leased, not bought. So very high 2- year depreciation results in much higher lease costs compared to an equivalent BMW or Audi. When these 'buyers' are shopping, a $300/mo lease and $500/mo lease is huge. They don't care about MSRP, just monthly cost, and the depreciation is the main factor in that. So Alfa sells fewer new cars as a result. Alfa doesn't care at all about used cars. That car has already been purchased. That's money in their pocket. They don't get more.",AlfaRomeo

"You can buy the Mopar extended warranty for Alfa Romeo since the brand is owned by the parent company Stellantis.  There are tiers of coverage depending on what you want covered.

It's affordable, has a low deductible and it's better than any third party warranty.  If you buy your AR from a Stellantis dealer you can sometimes roll it into the loan as well.  If not, there are a few contacts the forum people use that do zero markup on the premium.

It's best to buy it just before the factory warranty ends, because it's cheaper, and also it starts the day you buy it.  I bought my warranty 7 days before my QV warranty ended.",AlfaRomeo

"One more vote to RWD. Unless you 100% need AWD, RWD is just more fun. Even if you have snow 1 or 2 times per year, that means you can have fun sliding around in the snow 1 or 2 times per year instead of always being grippy. Additionally, it's lighter, cheaper to run (less fuel), cheaper to buy, less prone to failures (less parts)",AlfaRomeo
I looked at it yesterday... it has a tiny bit of rust... so I shouldnt put one there to prevent any more rusting?,AlfaRomeo
"Appreciate the feedback. I‚Äôve actually reached out to my insurance broker to quote what the cost would be on a QV. Still waiting to hear back. I didn‚Äôt think about the oil chance price. I‚Äôm used to paying around $100 for my current Audi through an independent. Thankfully I live in a big metro with a decent car culture, so I‚Äôll try to get some prices on oil changes from independent shops. Thank you!",AlfaRomeo
Check or change your battery.,AlfaRomeo

Both YOLO,AlfaRomeo
"Thanks very much! I‚Äôve already planed an ‚ÄúAlfa and Omega‚Äù photo! Hahaha

The ones I‚Äôm looking at are H2 2019. Hopefully no major reliability issues with them. I heard about carbon build-up but wasn‚Äôt aware of much else major (besides the facelift I‚Äôm not too fussed about). Sorry to go on about it, but what issues have you heard of pre-2020?",AlfaRomeo
"tough question. I have Einbachs -35mm and there is about a centimeter gap between the tire and the spring. Maybe installing spacers will help, I think you can buy the smallest 10mm ones, otherwise the wheel will protrude beyond the outline of the car, which is illegal in Poland",AlfaRomeo
Sweet dude. I bought the ‚Äò19 base model at 21. I‚Äôm 24 right now and still enjoying it. Congrats!,AlfaRomeo
Get the Stelvio - It‚Äôs like having a girlfriend on the side. Life is short.,AlfaRomeo
You already posted in the right group. So the answer is clear. Alfa Romeo.,AlfaRomeo
"Not sure why I‚Äôm getting downvoted here. I‚Äôm simply just trying to see if anyone else is having the same issue and if so get it resolved. I love my Alfa but the experience with the dealer and Alfa corporate has been subpar at best. This should not be occurring on a less than two year old car, no matter what manufacturer it is.",AlfaRomeo

"From 2009 up to 2020 The Outback had  an option of an H6 3.6L NA 256 HP engine, which would be on par with the power of the Alfa.
The newest generation dropped the 3.6L and instead offers a H4 2.4L Turbo, with a power output of 260 HP.
Earlier generations had an option of H6 3.0L NA engines.",AlfaRomeo
From the Netherlands to Southern Italy. Not going to brake a record I guess,AlfaRomeo
"Yeah. I bought my Giulia from my father, and he gave me the run down for oil changes. $15 filters from Mopar, need to get 5.5 quarts of Mobil One 0W 30 Euro spec oil from Advanced Auto which is like $50 total.

Find a local mechanic that will do the job for vastly less thab the dealership within an hour: Rinse and repeat every 7-9k miles.",AlfaRomeo
Subarus are the cars of liberals after all,AlfaRomeo
From what I read the first owner got the 2 minor accidents (driver side front and passenger side rear). Sold it then owner 2 bought it had it for 2 years but did no service on it ( at least reported on the car fax). Then owner 3 is the dealership,AlfaRomeo
Had a red 1985 SudTi back in the day. I loved it!,AlfaRomeo
Love it‚Ä¶. Can‚Äôt buy a hatchback like it anymore‚Ä¶.,AlfaRomeo
These are the fastest depreciating vehicles you can buy.  I don‚Äôt get it.,AlfaRomeo
I get 19mpg in my QV. I‚Äôd think the 4cyl would do better then 21.,AlfaRomeo
"https://youtu.be/2q67HsCTXr0?si=exi6KtO22_gJrFw4

Looks pretty easy. I think oil changes are a good way to start learning a bit more about cars. Over time you'll learn more as you do other maintenance parts which are also decently easy to do and you'll save quite a sizeable amount of money.",AlfaRomeo
Yeah like if you compare to m3 or c63 amg. They're less but not like ridiculously less,AlfaRomeo
Nah I get it and the mc20 is beautiful asF but I agree with the whole Alfa not using they‚Äôre heritage to they‚Äôre advantage.,AlfaRomeo
This problem very much exists anywhere with in demand street parking‚Ä¶ unique solution here and certainly looks better than those god awful rubber bumper blankets. Well done OP!,AlfaRomeo
"Ich sehe viele, aber die gelegenheit neben einem zu parken bietet sich einfach nicht üòî",AlfaRomeo
Currently fighting with the dealer. They want to test just the paint on the hood and not on the a pillars. They are saying ‚Äúrock chips caused the clear coat peel‚Äù which is total BS. A local reputable body shop told me this is a clear case of clear coat failure and to have all the areas tested.,AlfaRomeo

"Glad to hear about the overall reliability. Good looks with the charger. There are models that range from $94-$200, which did you have?",AlfaRomeo
"The GME 2.0L gasoline engine used in the Giulia does NOT have a nitrided crank and the pistons are NOT forged.

The crank is produced from a mid-grade steel and is a mass production style forging (with only 4 counterweights) and induction hardened journals.  Almost all modern cranks in the past 25-30 years go through controlled superfinishing polishing of the journals uses two halves of a concave radius shoe that retains the polishing tape and these two shoes clamp down on the journal and oscillate as the crank is rotated.

The pistons are die cast aluminum.

The crank specs you gave are accurate for the Quadrifoglio, but even the Quadrifoglio engines have cast pistons for cost savings.

Since most modern engines are designed to cruise at low revs, look at the shift points in automatic, you tend to design for longer strokes to give the engine a bit more natural torque and driving flexibility in the low RPM range to help fill in the gap to when the turbo builds sufficient boost.  Jag's Ingenium family is relatively ""long stroke"", same with BMW's current B48 4-cyl (94.6mm stroke).  Mercedes 4-cyl M260/M264 at 92mm stroke.  It isn't uncommon at all, it is actually the design route most manufacturers have taken in the past decade.",AlfaRomeo
What do you drive a yugo?,AlfaRomeo

No. If it detects the issue within the 40 cold starts then it‚Äôll kick the light on again.,AlfaRomeo
Haha that does suck! Definitely glad it wasn‚Äôt worse though!,AlfaRomeo
The QV has been one of the best purchases I‚Äôve ever made. It is so good.,AlfaRomeo
I won‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a V or inline if we actually get a new 6-cyl Giulia.,AlfaRomeo
"Quite frankly, it‚Äôs the perfect balance of size, sportiness, practicality (for a sedan w/ hatch) and comfort in one package. A really excellent daily driver. 

However, I did have one significant failure at about 8k mikes where the whole car went into limp mode for an unknown reason. Dealership said the code and Acura HQ called for a replacement of the gas pedal‚Ä¶ (weird). Since then, no issues. 

Also, I keep seeing in r/acura a lot of reports of the ‚Äústicky steering wheel‚Äù affecting what looks to be 24MY Integras where the steering wheel shows resistance when turning at high speeds. Some defect with a steering column component is my understanding. My 23MY doesn‚Äôt have an issue like that, but apparently it‚Äôs something that is being investigated for the Integra and Civic models.

I daily drive the car everyday putting lots of miles. Smooth on the highway and an absolute hoot on winding roads. Suspension can feel a bit stiff at times but still super comfortable.",AlfaRomeo

"Pardon my ignorance, is that a 159?",AlfaRomeo
My 159 is parked and stopped. Clutch problems.,AlfaRomeo
"I rolled my arches! It helped but it didn't fix the problem properly! It still rubs on the corner where the bumper meets the rear quarter panel, I couldn't roll that part of the arch üòÖ 

That's interesting that you still rub with passengers on factory suspension. My back seats are useless for passengers at the moment, and I have to be careful how much fuel I fill ü§£ 
I was thinking about buying either Koni Sport Shocks for their adjustable dampening, or Bilstein B6 with the Eibach pro kit(the kit that lowers the car 30mm). The logic is the stiffer shock will help with having passengers in the back seats. But I don't want to ruin ride quality. The Ducati Corse came with 18 inch wheels from factory, and the ride was unbearable with those, but they didn't rub because the offset is not as wide as the GTA wheels.",AlfaRomeo
"WTF!?! That prices is nuts. Gorgeous car, no doubt about that, but I‚Äôve seen similar, in some cases better, condition ones go for half that in the last 12 months.",AlfaRomeo
"I have an 18.  Every issue I‚Äôve had with it has been battery related, which has survived multiple battery replacements.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just the ones that shipped; either some kind of alternator issue or parasitic drain.  That being said, is more annoying than costly at this point since it‚Äôs my first go to fix.  There is a potential upside to the earlier models I don‚Äôt see above; mine has CCBs and since I haven‚Äôt tracked it, I‚Äôll likely have the motor blow before I need to replace.",AlfaRomeo
Oil changes for both years is enough.,AlfaRomeo
I'll give you $10.,AlfaRomeo
Haha agreed!,AlfaRomeo
I just purchase it from Florida last month. I live in central Texas.,AlfaRomeo
"And if you own a modern one, you're fine. Any car built in the past 20 years can be babied or abused, within broad limits, and go forever.

This is not how cars worked before \~1990. Especially before 1980, in Italy. Italian cars in the pre-electronic era were engineered with the assumption they would be driven hard. If they weren't, various narrow passages would get clogged up. Clearances wouldn't be met. Things got, well, sticky.

Back in the day, anyone who drove an Italian car ""like I treasure it"" would bring it to their mechanic every year because it wasn't working right. The mechanic would assure the owner that they'd investigate the problem, wait until the owner had gone home, and then bomb around in the thing for a half hour. It would run fine when turned over to the owner.

It came to be known as an Italian Tune Up. And it's a real thing. 

Again, this is for old Alfas. Old cars, really. But you have to understand an Alfa is engineered with the assumption it'll be driven at 9/10ths regularly. As long as you're not a lunatic, it'll be fine.

Enjoy yours.",AlfaRomeo
"74 GTV 2000 that I bought recently and is still in the recommissioning process (ride, repair, repeat) and 9 of 10 fixes have been due to the incompetence of the previous owners.

"They are quite different cars, tbh, so it sounds like you first need to figure out what you want. Also, how long do you plan to own it? Teslas are notorious for having an interior at 50k miles that looks like it's done 200k. You can also get the Alfa with lower miles and crucially, still in warranty for another year or so. The Tesla isn't a bad car necessarily, but IMO it has issues and tradeoffs that means either you *want* a Tesla, or you don't, if that makes sense. And honestly, the Alfa is kinda similar, for different underlying reasons. There is a reason most people shopping an entry level premium car go with Audi A4/5 or BMW 330i.",AlfaRomeo

Bought the Stelvio Q new about 6 months ago.  5300 miles on it so far.  So we'll likely end up at 11-12k a year for that car.   Which means the accessory belt (not timing belt) will need servicing every 3-3.5 years for our usage.  I'm not concerned about maintenance costs or intervals.,AlfaRomeo

Mi currently own 2 Milanos.  One we race in the 24 Hours of Lemons.  It has 190k miles on it and can handle 14 hours of racing.   So they aren‚Äôt fragile if they are maintained.

That is really my main point and not sure why it‚Äôs controversial. I would say the same thing to anyone driving an X3. It‚Äôs not a real BMW. The Stelvio is not a real Alfa,AlfaRomeo

"I waited to find a 2020, and IMO it was worth it. But it's budget dependent.  The 2020 is absolutely worth the extra cost, but if it's not in budget it's not in budget. Another factor is factory warranty. I think you should try to have at least 6 months left on it to get any issues you find dealt with for free. I had a whine in the cabin blower motor, that only shows up after 40 ish minutes of driving.  Known thing apparently, and an easy fix, but the previous owner never drove it that long so never noticed, and never got it fixed. Now that I found it, I can get it done free.",AlfaRomeo

Maybe as an advice, check if there is any rattling from the rear axle and the inner side of the rear tires isn‚Äôt run down.

Oh I knew it. Watch out for first 1k km if it is consuming oil. Make sure every belt and all it goes with it was changed recently. If the car wasn't drived for years make sure you change all fluids. That engine needs quality racing fuel 10w60 you could go with castrol selenia or motul. Fully synthetic is the go. I have a 1.6ts. They aren't really to expensive to maintain. But they really need proper care. Since a lot of previous users just drive them hard. I think its only natural for them to use oil if they were driven for a long time. I had mine with reworked head and it is still consuming 250-300ml of 10w40. Isnt a  lot but not the best either. If its anything more to you. Maybe your head and pistons need work. Now don't get me wrong I don't think they are bad. Well I like mine even if its still consuming little bit of oil. But I wanted to say that you should be aware of every possible failing point on these cars.,AlfaRomeo

"I hope it as well :)
I know that the situations might look similar but I think they are different. The unpleasant situation with the Hornet was that the Chrysler side of stellantis didn't believe in the Tonale. As a mid range vehicle, with no legacy.. so they preferred to rebrand it with Dodge..and actually it worked. 
For the Giulia I believe it's different. Different legacy and expectations..it would be really really stupid going for a copy paste solution",AlfaRomeo
"One thing is certain, Alfa's are very similar to BMWs as far as the owner being able to or for that fact, willing to do his/her own maintenance. You really do need to have solutions at your disposal, such as being able not only to properly lift the new Alfas (hydraulic floor jack and lift pads), but also preparing tall enough wooden boxes or pieces of stacked wooden blocks to keep the car raised under the tires. Do you have a garage? Are you willing to remove nineteen or so torx screws from under the front to begin getting to the oil filter and drain plug? How about knowing that removing a wheel is one thing, but installing a wheel without TWO guide pins is frustratingly difficult? I bought a Giulia because I can't drive a boring car, and also am willing to invest my knowledge in automotive maintenance as well as tools and time, along with scouring the interwebs in finding the information on maintenance that is 100% correct for my car. No matter what may happen to my Giulia, I feel confident that I can repair it to a high standard, higher even than a dealership could (that's not saying much, I know).",AlfaRomeo

I would say that many people are disappointed in the Stelvio‚Äôs bells and whistles, including the poor sound system and backup camera.

"i feel you bro. the repairing cost side is really one of the biggest downsides to owning an Alfa. they don't break down often but that bill is expensive. there's a reason though these cars are sold at like 170-200k kms the most. before that, they really have a small amount of issues, but then everything kinda needs replacing.

My Spider has 185k kilometres. I've owned it for a month now, and while i truly love the car it's expensive to maintain. i've already spent 700‚Ç¨ on servicing, and it was all fluids replaced, timing belt replaced with water pump, a serpentine belt roller and the back left coil spring. that's just the start of it though. i desperately need new tires, they're going to set me back 800‚Ç¨ because i want good ones. And then wheel alignment and i'll probably need to replace wishbones at the front. Not to mention, in a year or so i'll need a new dual mass flywheel with a clutch set. I almost forgot to mention, my engine has 2 serpentine belts, and the smaller of the two squeals and needs replacing, which is another 250‚Ç¨. so yeah happy days.

Therefore, it's not a cheap affair, but i guess it's worse for you because 1500‚Ç¨ on a mito is a pretty big chunk of the car's value, but you get the benefit of driving the coolest supermini there is. As for my repairs, i know they're worth it, because it just makes sense to me that years down the line the 939 Spider will shoot up in value, and beside that, the car deserves to be perfect.",AlfaRomeo

I needed a rear wheel too, and have one ordered from Jason at Alfissimo.  MUCH MUCH better pricing than the dealer.  It isn't a stock item, you'll need to ask him to order you one.

"Stelvio Quad Dealer Service pricing I've seen quoted elsewhere:

Spark Plug Change:  $600-700

Brakes (4 discs, pads, labor):   $4000+, seriously the discs are $750/ea

Serpentine Belt Change:  $2500-$3500, the entire front facia, radiator, intercoolers, etc have to come off to get to the front of the engine.

The Stelvio Quadrifolgio is an all weather supercar, you have near super car capabilities and operating/maintenance costs.  MPG is awful, I've never reached the quoted 23mpg highway.  Daily commuting and I'm in the 14-15mpg range in mixed driving.  That said, it is extremely efficient at converting hydrocarbons into happiness.  If you can afford to live with one, you won't be disappointed.  I just crossed the 5000 mile mark on the one I got 6 months ago, so I haven't had to do any services yet other than a break-in oil change I had done at 2700 miles and that cost me about $450 at local import specialist (and I supplied the oil and filter, the filter cartridge itself is just like a current Ferrari filter and costs about $90 itself).",AlfaRomeo

"I‚Äôm honestly torn. For a longevity of the brand, this is a great thing. The more parts they share, the thinner the margins are to build each car, and the more they can justify continuing to produce a car that sells at lower volumes. Jaguar and Alfa will eternally be my two favorite automakers, but there will be no more ICE Jags in the future so it‚Äôs nice knowing Alfas will still have them (for now). Plus, I think it will fill the gap between the 2.0 and the QV. They never really had anything to market against he Jags/Audi/BMW v6 cars.  

On the other hand, and I know this makes me sound like a posh elitist, the Dodge Charger and really that whole brand is the one I‚Äôd probably least want to be associated with. It was a nitpicky thing that kept me out of one the first time (plus the previously mentioned V6 issue, I didn‚Äôt want a QV). We‚Äôve had late model jeeps in our family, and the Stelantis and finish just reminds me of early/mid 2000‚Äôs American cars.  Combined with their current relevance and pulp culture, i.e. street takeovers or the popular anecdote that every other hellcat you see is probably stolen.  

For me, I guess it will all depend on how much of their individuality they‚Äôll be able to retain. Again, posh and elitist, but I just don‚Äôt want to know I‚Äôm driving a Dodge charger in an Italian suit. I want the real Italian.  And I love how rare they are. I see 1000 muscle cars for every Giulia.  Hoping that ratio does not change.",AlfaRomeo

"Regardless of cost all cars can have issues with paint.
Fresh Ferraris are notorious for having very big issues and many owners get a full on detail and correction done.

Don't deal with the dealership. Go to Alfa directly.
If they are testing the paint then that is considered doing something in my opinion.

They probably want to see if there are indeed issues in the paint composition in your batch or if you might have had some contaminants from the road or other that compromised the area.

Please do report back with the outcome so others can search and to see how Alfa handles it.

Again, issues can happen on all cars but when you are paying a premium for the car, what matters is how it's handled. This should be considered when shopping for a new car in the future.

Remember dealers are usually sub par after a car is sold. The manufacturer can make it right.

"People these days are so confused.

Modern non-performance oriented turbocharged cars are not even meant to be redlined. They kinda die around 5k and they are engineered to give you a shove around 2k to make you feel as if they're fast.

Cars, not just Alfas lol, cars in general used to need to be redlined because that's where they made their peak power, and peak torque was usually not much below. Petrol cars, especially with larger displacement and/or more cylinders (and especially Italian ones) also used to sound a lot better, mostly higher in the rev-range, so we redlined them not just to make 'em go, but to hear that glorious sound. I remember my old 146 Ti, it would be a real slouch by today's standards, but it sure as hell sounded better than any of these Euro6+ compliant turbo shitboxes.

A freaking Busso, as torquey as it is down low, also only comes alive above 4k.

Everyone's free to drive their own cars the way they want. It just saddens me how ppl these days consider revving an engine to the redline as abuse. I guess there's a reason cars (outside expensive sportscars) are getting more dull by the year.

Not an Alfa, but I had to go and watch [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o40Gqr7nma4) at least 3 times to shrug off the depression this post gave me :D",AlfaRomeo
"What a beauty. My mum had a Sprint Veloce Cloverleaf when was I was a kid, I still remember the dashboard and some of the lovely sounds. Gorgeous cars!",AlfaRomeo
"Most of the 2.0s are leased when new, not bought, so the service is usually pretty easy to trust.  If you get one coming in off a lease at the dealer that leased it originally, it should be about as confident as it gets (that's what I went with).  I'm not thinking so much about return on investment, but rather how much money I'm spending for what I'm getting.  One, my budget didn't allow new anyway, but two, whatever the budget is, the question I ask is 'what is the best car (for me) that I can get for this money.'  What the 'for me' part is depends on your specific criteria - fun, comfort, reliability, running costs, resale etc.  I could get a sketchy R35 GT-R for $35k, if the reliability, running costs etc were a low enough priority, or if those are the absolute maximum priority, I'd probably wind up with a Camry hybrid or whatever.  It's just a big game of balancing traits to one's preferences for their given price point, which is why advice is always different - too many variables for any two people to really have the exact same set of priorities.

I was confident with my used buy for the following reasons.  It was an Alfa/Maserati dealer, not a Fiat/Alfa dealer, and this dealer has Lambos, Astons etc on the lot and in their shop regularly, so I'm confident the mechanics are quality and used to taking good care of cars (also they aren't joyriding a 2.0 Giulia when they regularly see far more exotic cars - was a frequent concern in the WRX and Focus ST crowds I was in before).  This dealer is the one near Microsoft. It's a very wealthy area, so very low chance it was owned by some kid who couldn't afford upkeep and ragged it.  Car is still in warranty for 9 months (from when I bought it), so enough time to find any lingering issues and have them fixed for free.  Car was a lease trade-in, with full lease-required service records at this same dealer. And finally, there are two local Alfa dealers, both high-end with Maserati and more, so I'm confident they'll be around to keep servicing it.  As for the break-in, that's always hard to really know.  I guess if the car drives right, has the gas mileage and power it should, they probably did?

I have had 3 things pop up on mine on the reliability front, but these are minor and are being fixed under warranty (was just in the shop for the 4-year service slightly early, so I had them look at all these at the same time while it's in warranty).  Also, Mopar extended warranties are pretty affordable for this car- I plan to do that.  The issues I've had: 

Driver seat lumbar adjustment would work, but slowly return to the default position.  Seems to be a clear slow leak in the air bladder that the system uses, mechanic confirmed, new part ordered.  Would be a DIY-able fix as well.  Likely that the previous owner didn't use that part of the adjustment, and never noticed.

HVAC blower motor has a bearing in the fan that is on its way out.  This is a semi-common issue (probably the same part on the QV as well).  Part ordered on warranty. All it does is develop a quiet but high pitched whine after 30+ mins of driving.  Based on the mileage, knowing that the previous owner worked at Microsoft (from chatting to the sales rep), and where he lived, I'd guess he rarely if ever drove far enough to let the bearing heat up and start whining, so didn't notice.

Some strange metal part fell out of the driver mirror housing.  No clue what it is, mechanic didn't know either. Chances are it's something in the adjustment mechanism, but I don't adjust it (only driver) and the diagnostic would be a pain/expense that may not be warranty if they can't find what it came from - may not be from my car at all.  

So my only issues were minor and fixed under warranty, and only expenses were the regular 4-year service, and tires.  OEM tires are garbage in anything by dry conditions, FYI.  They also last about 20k miles, like most OEM tires these days.  Check out the Tire Reviews YT channel for a recent video that goes into why.",AlfaRomeo

"Alfa already feels so much less special now that Giulia/Stelvio are currently sharing parts with Hornet (steering wheel, entire door panel, etc).

"Rust first and most importantly of all. Rusty cars can still be fun, but fixing them properly is much more expensive than a 2a will likely ever be worth. 

82 is the first year for Bosch electronic injection. It's a system that was in wide use at the time and improved the drivability/reliability quite a bit. The hoses might need to be renewed, especially if they're original to the car.

Maintenance-wise it's no better or worse than most cars of that era. But it is really old and will likely need a *lot* of it compared to a modern car.

When the engine is cold, remove the radiator cap and examine both it and the coolant. If there is any sludge evident, that's a blown head gasket. Walk away.

"I guess I'm just worried about the prospect of the Giulia sharing a platform with Jeeps and Dodge Chargers. I'm struggling to grasp how an agile sedan can be built on the same platform as large SUVs and a modern muscle car. They're on opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of driving expectations.

I'm hoping that you're right and the STLA large platform is a true evolution of the Giorgio. But I can't help but think compromises were made so that this platform could accommodate offroad and electric vehicles.

I hope I'm wrong. I hope that the platform manages to elevate Jeep and Dodge instead of taking away from the Giulia's specialness. Perhaps the reason they're not leaning in on the Giorgio name is because it was developed by the previous management group, but maybe the spirit is still there.",AlfaRomeo

"I have had this happen 3 or 4 times on my 2018 TI. Started up and ran roughly like on 3 cylinders, ‚Äúsevice engine ‚Äú and or ‚Äúservice electronic throttle and CE light all on.‚Äú . Start/ stop is just a byproduct of those warnings. Drive about 3/4 mile and shut off the engine, waited about a minute and restarted. Runs ok now. CE light and ‚Äúservice engine ‚Äú stay on. Continued to work, 30 miles, runs normal. Leave work and CE light and start/stop still showing but sevice engine has cleared. Next day warnings still present in the morning but upon leaving work all warnings are clear and everything thing is back to normal.It is usually cold, below freezing or very foggy and wet. I don‚Äôt really know if that‚Äôs connected. FWIW, I am on my original battery, my dealer mechanic indicated that if you replace the battery and clear any codes thrown everything resets. If you disconnect the existing battery, reconnect and clear any codes it will also reset everything. What he is saying as I interpreted it is: many people replace the battery unnecessarily as it is the disconnect/ reconnection and clear codes that resets the system not the fact that the battery is new. Anyway I don‚Äôt panic when the car does this anymore, it just seems to do it once in awhile and clears itself. I am just coming 70K miles.",AlfaRomeo

"Don‚Äôt really need to wait for the turbo to build boost on the 2.0 petrol Giulia as peak torque is at 1,900 rpm and totally flat, initially ECU controlled, to about 4,750rpm where torque starts to drop. Gains replacing standard turbo with hybrid are still being developed. I‚Äôve a long way to go with mine.

I do agree that a long stroke engine increases low down torque but, on the flip side and due to piston G forces, must be rev limited earlier than an over-square engine. Long stroke engines, due to piston speed and piston acceleration limits therefore normally being lower revving do tend to lose more energy as heat but the pros and cons of long stroke V over square is a long one especially in a road car.",AlfaRomeo
I will say that I did alot of highway driving with mine and noticed my mpg would drop off noticeably leading up to oil change intervals. Every time I got it serviced it would go right back to normal range.,AlfaRomeo
Awd is the best. Rear bias and AWD when need it.,AlfaRomeo
No it doesn‚Äôt. Upgrading the BOV keeps the pressure at a constant level. Reducing lag in the turbo. So to answer your question it doesn‚Äôt affect the longevity of the turbo. Unless you are on track. The only thing you have to worry about is a leak due to very high constant pressures. I will probably go with Madness one because it seems to have a lot better reviews,AlfaRomeo

"Not only that, in Alfas if you for example change cluster or how to say it, if flashes odometer until you put real value (read in multiecuscan for instance). So maybe someone tried to 'lower' the odometer by replacing it, or replaced because something happened. 

Situation is easier if you buy a car, it works OK and then t starts flashing, so you know something happened. Can be blue&me dying, maybe battery needs replacements.

"If you do go down this path - [AlfaBB forums](http://www.alfabb.com/bb/forums/milano-75-1985-1993/) are your friend. There's so much good content on there over the last 25 years that you'll be able to find out how to do everything written down on there.

The other resource any 75/Milano or GTV6 owner should have permanently saved off is Greg Gordon's long standing guide to the LJet system - it'll pretty much help you tune up and diagnose any issue related to Bosch fuel injection - https://hpsimotorsports.com/blogs/tech-articles/gregs-bosch-l-jetronic-fuel-injection-idle-adjustment-diagnostic-and-tune-up-page

Greg had been a long standing God on the 12V V6, having owned, built and even designed and sold supercharger kits for them over the years.

There's some big expenses in there though, split across mechanicals (engine and gearbox up to speed) and of course body work (rust repair, repairs to front bar, respray). It's the type of job where finding a second parts donor could also be beneficial - you'll probably end up bringing in parts from Europe more than anything.

Good solid project that'd be rewarding though. There's a reason I have new and old Bussos in the garage!",AlfaRomeo

"1100 miles (\~1770 km) from North Little Rock AR to Glen Burnie MD in a '74 Spider that was more rust than steel, with a nose that had an inch of body filler covering it. December 1996, I was 28. I couldn't find a job in AR, brother lived in MD, so I pulled up stakes and headed east.

He and his wife had traveled down for the holidays, so they followed me as we drove. I'd bodged up replacing the SPICA pump that summer and had an incessant oil leak that covered my brother's car in oil by the time we made it through Tennessee. The radio didn't work so I had bought a  walkman and some books on tape. The alternator light started flickering not long after we'd passed into Virginia, which triggered a blast of static through the walkman.

We did the entire thing in one go, Probably 17-18 hours total, maybe longer. At the end the alternator light was nearly strobing. The oil pressure light came on just as I pulled into the driveway. I drank a couple of beers and then went to bed.

The SPICA issue was me being an idiot and not putting all the washers under the bolts. The alternator light was a loose wire on the back of the thing. I got all that and more repaired before another idiot move on my part saw a wheel literally fall off in '97. This did damage that more than totaled it.

The longest drive I've done with its replacement, which I have to this day, is two trips from Alexandria VA to Campbell Hall NY, 285 miles and \~ 4.5 hours. Last one was probably 1999. It completed them with a total lack of drama that has been this car's calling card throughout the years.",AlfaRomeo

The giulia is a great car though and with good maintenance comes great rides. I‚Äôve only had one minor issue with mine being the starter relay and she‚Äôs been good to me.

"There's never been a confirmed case of engine failure due to LSPI on the GME 2.0L.  There was a ""tear down"" on the GiuliaForums where the halfwit internet amoeba's declared failure was due to the wrong oil and resulting LSPI, and while it was an LSPI failure there was a foreign substance introduced into the combustion chamber that wasn't from the oil.  They neglected to realize that the copper anti-seize someone had used on the plugs has a petroleoum grease base that is anywhere from 15-30% calcium AND the copper particulate content may have acted to helped initiate the LSPI by providing a thermal hot spot.

Remember this engine was developed in Europe, with 1000s of real world driving cycles and controlled dyno cycles (all with sensors beyond what is in the car - including real-time cylinder pressure sensos), and then tear down inspections to check for wear.  The recommended European oil never changed either, and still no LSPI fears in Europe.

No reason to do 5K oil changes unless you consider your use ""severe"", but it won't hurt.  I certainly wouldn't do oil changes more frequently than 5k, as modern oils are specifically formulated for extended drains  with high detergent loads and you don't want the very aggressive detergent packages cleansing the A/W additives from the component surfaces.  For the average user, 5K oil changes are a bit early.  Alfa wouldn't have recommended a maximum of 10K miles if that was insufficient, they have more data than anyone, especially much more than internet randos.",AlfaRomeo

"Very nice, thanks! I did the Cobb Stage 1 on the WRX to try to eliminate the jerkiness and rev hang, which worked for a bit but then it seemed like the ECU somehow ‚Äúrelearned‚Äù it or something. Plus monitoring the numbers just gave me anxiety about it so I ended up uninstalling it. I agree on the QV, there‚Äôs a small part of me that‚Äôs afraid I‚Äôll have FOMO from not owning such a cool car, but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll at very least get in enough trouble to get my license taken away, and at worst wrap the thing around a tree.",AlfaRomeo

From 1983-89 it was known as the Alfa Romeo Sprint and if you zoom into that lovely red example you'll see that it only says Sprint on the back. 

OPs example is an Alfasud Sprint but I'm not going to criticise them for calling it a Sprint if they want to.",AlfaRomeo
"It's a Verde so it's got the desirable 3L engine. Sadly, the cars aren't worth very much. Unless you can do all the work yourself you'll end up spending much less money on a nice one. Other than the drive train there doesn't seem to be a lot to work with here. 

That said, if all you wanted was a beater that literally nobody else will be driving around in you could do a lot worse. Change all the fluids, put in a new battery, and drive it until it breaks something expensive. Then it's on to the next one.

Both are valid ways to enjoy classic cars. 

A data point: our Milano Verde was rough but much nicer than this one. When it didn't start one morning last Spring I decided it was time for it to find a new home. I put it up on Fb marketplace for $750 and it sold in about 15 minutes. Went to brothers who ran their own Alfa shop.",AlfaRomeo

"It‚Äôs my daily, though my commute is 22 miles round trip. Handling is fantastic - but you‚Äôve probably read about the tramlining. This is resolved through front suspension blocks and different tires than the OEM P Zero. 

Speaking of tires, the P Zero is the only pair that officially fits the car. A lot us owners swap to a +10 width front and rear to open the selection up greatly (and help tramlining as noted above). 

Lack of power steering sucks when parking, especially in reverse. Otherwise you don‚Äôt notice it.

Seats have to be taken out of the car to be fully adjusted, but it‚Äôs 4 bolts and unclipping 2 harness wires. Pretty easy and makes a potential significant difference in comfort. 

Last thing to note: either ‚Äúbasic‚Äù OEM exhaust can drone pretty decent. The later Akrapoviƒç option is valved and changes depending on drive mode. Hard to find though and $$$. I have a Sector 111 straight piped exhaust with a Helmholtz chamber that kills ALL the drone and sounds incredible. It is unfortunately out of production. 

All this said, the car by most takes is love or hate. No real in between. I happen to be one of the lovers and will never get rid of it unless a spider comes along‚Ä¶ maybe.

Edit: I‚Äôm in Southern California. Makes driving as a daily fairly easy and my short commute is against traffic. She‚Äôs fun in the rain and Dynamic mode. Rear will step out nicely and slide pretty good until the eased up stability control kicks in juuuuust at the right time.",AlfaRomeo

It crazy that Maserati is charging nearly $30k more for what is essentially a base Stelvio with a very minor ECU tune, plus it looks extremely feminine.  Huge discounts coming to Grecales soon too.  After the initial new car launch sales interest, they too are now are dead.

"You can purchase a MVP plan (MOPAR Vehicle Protection) before or after the original warranty expires. 

If you purchase while still under the factory warranty the years/mileage is based on original vehicle in-service date and total milage. So 8yr/100k is 8 years from original in-service date and 100k total miles.

Purchased out of warranty you may need to have the vehicle inspected for preexisting issues and the years/mileage is based on the date of warranty purchase and current mileage of the vehicle. Purchased on a 5 year old car with 30k miles a 4yr/60k plan would run 4 years from the date the warranty is purchased and up to 90k miles.

Definitely worth it.",AlfaRomeo

"My giulia is on the same boat, its in the shop at the moment for a front bumper replacement and my current estimate is about $1400. Heres the tricky part, the shop found out yesterday that there's 3 air vents glued on to the front bumper which they cant reuse. So now they have placed an order for the airvents which will probably increase my estimate, and of course one of the airvents is a month in back order. I will report back once I have the final damage",AlfaRomeo
