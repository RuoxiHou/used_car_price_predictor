"I have a 2012 Sportage SX with 40k miles and I absolutely love it.  Fun to drive, great handling, so-so gas milage.  Although I have the push button start I'm deathly afraid the Kia boys will still break in and attempt to steal it. I put both a steering wheel lock and brake lock on as visual deterrents. Where was your potential car built? I have read on this forum of problems with engines built in the USA. Mine was built in Korea so I'm crossing my fingers.  I'd do some due diligence.  There are websites to check for engine issues. I would also check on insurance rates due to Kia theft issues.  Good luck; as I said I do love my Sportage!",kia

"When will these automakers learn‚Ä¶ NO ONE wants climate controls in a touchscreen.  Literally everyone complains about how stupid it is.  Everyone wants physical knobs and buttons for ALL climate controls, completely separate from the infotainment.
If the touchscreen has redundant controls (like my current Forte GT) that‚Äôs fine, but thats still just a waste because no one will use them.
Current gen GTI was basically ruined by its terrible reliance on touchscreen for everything.  Same can be said for the current WRX with is giant vertical tablet taking up most of the dash",kia

"I consider 30 mpg to be pretty good gas mileage. You should be pleased with that.

I mean, I was seriously as gentle on the accelerator as I possibly could be.

"Not a mechanic, but seems like transmission is slipping the gear. The 5000rpm limit might be the upper rev limiter.

Why slipping? Oil, or mechanical wear. Or possibly more likely the control TCM, solenoid, etc are getting faulty (intermittently).

Well said. Kia soul hate is so common but questionable,kia
"First, EV9 is a Kia, not a Hyundai. Second, the EV9 is the first year of a brand new model on a new platform with lots of new tech. Take that as you will. Third, there isn't much maintenance required on EVs. Forth, a quick Google told me that Kia sold about 6 times more cars than Volvo did last year, so their dealers are going to be busier. Kia also has a wider range of vehicles. Whether or not you consider it as such, Volvo presents itself as a luxury brand whereas Kia does not. This will be a large part of the different experiences you have when comparing the two. Fifth, Kia is having a hard time right now with recalls, and dealers are still having [competent] tech shortages. It wasn't always this way and it won't always be this way, but it's kind of this way now, at least in my area.¬†




Kia is still a growing car company. They've been improving every year since they've been in the US. I've been a tech at Kia dealers for going on 24 years, so I've seen it. They keep expanding their lineup and selling more every year. In my opinion, they're having some growing pains again. [Last year](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/kia-us-sales-figures/) they had a 15.33% increase in units sold from the previous year. 2022 was flat, and 2021 had 13.07% increase from the year prior. The cars are getting better styling and attracting more discerning customers, but the dealer experience just hasn't kept up. That's not to say we dealer employees don't want to please our customers, it's that Kia Motors America offers very little to aid us in doing so.¬†


This is just a perspective from a random redditor. Take it how you will.¬†",kia
Are you in the USA?  If som this is a terrible idea.  Older KIAs are fucking garbage.  Get a Toyota or something similar at that price.,kia
Technician with some experience on the matter. Sadly A chipped/burned valve is not covered by the engine campaign. That scenario would only be covered by powertrain warranty (5yr 60k for 2nd owner onward). Only advice is make sure you dont have any extended warranty from when you bought it or find a shop willing to disassemble the engine replace the valves (still not cheap but should be cheaper than replacement. If your curious I have an example image of a [burned valve on a 2.4 engine](https://imgur.com/a/PBQwLM4).,kia
I'm more curious bout powertrain tbh. We saw ghost cars months earlier so this design is what I expected.,kia
The thievery is still running rampant here in the Seattle area,kia
"Yes downvote. Like others have been saying can and should are two different things.
Your engine is fine and guess all that matters.
Brakes and stopping who cares I guess. Maybe you were mostly flat. Maybe downshifted on hills. Maybe got lucky. Maybe weight still within margin of safety. But get more bold with weight and will find the limit and won't necessarily be good.
Handling is a other thing. Maybe no wind. Maybe you slowed for the storms. But smaller vehicles you will find that trailer length and handling that especially in emergency handling you end up in the ditch.
Our midsize suv will safely pull lots of weight. But had to explain to wife as midsize suv and and not full size suv or full size truck couldn't safely pull some longer trailers even within weight limits. Yes stabilized hitches could work.
But just because you car can pull a trailer yes you very perfect engine that is not the whole story.
Does you car have capability for trailer brake hookup if needed?",kia
"My family looked at higher trims and we decided on lower trims because we didn't need all the added options and the dealer was willing to bargain down on the lower trims. The problem is that all drive pretty much the same, it's still the same car. We do have an SX as well we bought 2nd hand which was a bank repo, the only reason why we bought it was due to the price. Saved a lot of money, if we were to buy it new MSRP-wise I wouldn't do it.",kia
"I'm actually glad I took the opportunity when I had the chance,  I got to see places I would have never seen other wise,  it was a stressful magical experience for sure .

"Here's a summary of the issue: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia\_Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Challenge)

The trend varies greatly, depending on where you live. In many parts of the US, it is nothing to worry about. In some parts of the US, it's been a big problem. Try to find out if it's common where you live. A good place to start is by asking insurance companies if they will insure the car in your zip code. They have the best information about theft rates.",kia

But refusing to give the VIN number is a huge red flag, even if the vehicle was only a year old. And as others have mentioned, there are recalls for that year. It's not guaranteed to be a problem, but being out of warranty if something *does* go wrong it's guarenteed to be expensive.

"Over the life of my loan (purchased Oct '22) I have made extra payments that total a little over $100 more than a regular payment. I did not start making significant extra payments until recently. Can I ask what formula you use to calculate what's going to principal vs. interest? Took accounting in college but it wasn't my strong point in any sort for me to know how to calculate accurately, haha.",kia
Are you in USA or Canada?,kia
Good thing they aren't called inclement weather lights then.,kia
"I think this depends on the state in which you live or perhaps the amount of the extra payment. I make double the payments and I have checked the math and it is applying 100% of the extra payment to my principal. What is confusing is the payoff amount on my statement appears to have two months worth of interest. Meaning if I use the statement payoff amount to pay right after I get the statement I will have overpaid almost a months worth of interest, but if I payoff on the valid to payoff date I will not have paid any extra interest. Also it says next payment due $0 but in reality I have to still make at least the regular payment each month. I contacted Kia Finance to verify this. The Kia Finance interface is really poorly designed.

"I understand. I wasn't saying that is the only option. Just a simple one. You're right in that we don't know the interest rate of OPs loan.

 What I didn't say in my previous post is that in many cases making extra payments could also affect you negatively. Why? Let's say you make extra double  payments for a year and you're close to finishing paying but then the car gets into an accident and is a total loss. The insurance will only pay you the current value of the car. They won't factor inthe extra payments applied. You're still liable for the remaining loan and you're out of that extra money. One way you could go about deakin with this is  getting GAP coverage to cover  the insurance payout vs the difference in value of the car. However, this still doesn't negate the fact that you are still out the extra payments you make toward the car.

OP also needs to check with Kia about pre payment penalties to the loan. If there are, then they need to consider this before making extra payments.",kia

"A puncture is going to happen regardless of tire quality.

Tire wear at 22k miles is more concerning. Are they both front? Both rear? I'd check the alignment. But it could just be your driving style and/or crappy tires.

OEM tires tend to maximize comfort (for test drives) and MPG (to meet government standards), but not treadlife, since test drives won't reveal short treadlife.

22k miles is still too short even for crappy OEM tires. But maybe it's the combination of crappy tires plus aggressive driving style?

Finally, your glove box / sales documents should have come with a manufacturer tire warranty. If not, check the website of the tire manufacturer. The warranty is with the tire manufacturer, not the car manufacturer. As long as you've done tire rotations every 8k miles, the tires should have a manufacturer treadlife warranty.",kia

Definitely look into the LXS with technology package that has blindspot monitoring etc, i got a better insurance quote lol cause of the safety features.

- Also, the finance guy at my Kia dealership spent nearly 15 minutes trying to sell me an extended warranty.

"In trying to answer this question for myself, I quickly realized that it's only meaningful to ask it about the specific area where you live. The trend rises and falls at different times in different places. It was horrendous in Milwaukee in August 2021, but had already fallen there by almost half in the summer of 2022, when it was just beginning to skyrocket in Chicago. 

The graphs in this article by Vice show this phenomenon very clearly: 

[https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkaq9z/us-cities-have-a-staggering-problem-of-kia-and-hyundai-thefts-this-data-shows-it](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkaq9z/us-cities-have-a-staggering-problem-of-kia-and-hyundai-thefts-this-data-shows-it)

So if you want a decent answer for yourself, I think you'll have to try to find crime statistics published by the police in your area.

I live in New York City, and the police department here publishes weekly data on motor vehicle thefts (called 'grand larceny auto' by NYPD), broken out down to the precinct. The figures they provide are for all car brands combined, but in NYC nearly all of the elevated car theft rates over the past 12-18 months have been from the Kia/Hyundai TikTok challenge. So these figures are a fairly reliable way to judge the trend in Kia thefts.

In my borough (the Bronx) car theft rates peaked last summer (August-ish) and have been falling since then. Compared to the peak, they're down about 35%, as of now.

In my precinct, car thefts peaked a little earlier (around May of last year), have been falling since then. Compared to the peak, they are down about 48% as of now. 

When I was able to find these statistics, it lowered my sense of risk a bit. My car was damaged by a Kia boyz theft attempt last December, and I was trying to figure out if I need to sell it now, at any cost, or whether I can take a little time to weigh my options. I'm doing the latter.",kia

1. Repair these two wires. It is difficult to tell why these failed. If the wire snapped, splice it back together. If the metal bit at the end of the wire pulled out of the connector, you‚Äôll need to reinsert it. A lot of times the mating wire will match the color for harness-to-harness connections.

2. After you fix the wires, look for where this connector pair should be attached to. Usually there is a plastic clip. If that broke, use zip ties to mount the connector pair to prevent rattling and damage

3. What plugs in here? There shouldn‚Äôt be an open port on a device in a wet area. Either that branch is somewhere hidden in this picture, or it could be for the fascia harness. Is that what 6. Is?

4. Need to splice the broken wire back together

"The key issue here is the ""immobilizer"" or the lack thereof.

The majority of 2011 - 2021 Hyundai/Kia models **without push button start** do not have an immobilizer and are therefore susceptible to [""Kia Boyz"" theft](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/who-are-the-kia-boyz-how-tiktok-fueled-an-epidemic-of-car-thefts/).

**Any** Hyundai/Kia that is equipped with push button start (regardless of model year) has an immobilizer.  ""Kia Boyz"" technique will not work with these vehicles. 

There have been reported cases of insurers raising rates or in some cases refusing to insure impacted vehicles.  I have not heard or read anything suggesting that non-impacted Hyundai/Kia models are difficult/impossible to insure.

I know the engine and how to work on it. The replacement parts for it and similar cars are very affordable if they break and I can do it myself.  I don't need to pay a shop or for any warranty besides the ones on the parts, and a transmission etc rebuilt or new, performance additions are still under 1000 dollars. Liability insurance plus uninsured motorist is half the cost of full coverage.  

I save so much money driving my paid off car, why would I ever chain myself to a company or corporation who will, if my mileage is outside a number on the odometer etc will leave me waiting, or without a car I can't afford the parts or maintenance for and have to take out a loan for a new engine.

I swap the spark plug and coil pack to another cylinder and check live misfires to see if it moved to where I swapped them, the misfires stay on #2. I check compression on all cylinders.

Usually the first step on reading such a post on the Internet is to decide ""Truth? Or BS?"".

Your story (without the fact that you failed to pay the insurance and are likely cancelled) sounds highly suspicious.

WITH that fact it becomes very possible to be real.

In any case, your  (frankly) BAD ATTITUDE doesn't give too many people (even if they know the possible answer) a lot of incentive to help you.

Please keep in mind:

YOU failed to pay your car insurance.

It wasn't ME who had a responsibility to pay.

"Oil consumption is not covered under any settlements that extend the warranty, so if you're out of the manufacturer warranty, and don't have an extended warranty through a third party, you're almost certainly shit out of luck.   


The extended warranties, if your vehicle is eligible either through [kiaenginesettlement.com](https://kiaenginesettlement.com) (lifetime) or [kiaengineclasssettlement.com](https://kiaengineclasssettlement.com) (15 years or 150k miles from the original retail sale of the vehicle) it is only covered for connecting rod bearing failures. If you have a history of oil consumption to the point Kia has recommended a new engine and you fail to fix the vehicle, the extended warranty for the bearing issue becomes void, as failure to repair your vehicle is considered exceptional neglect. There are other caveats to the extended warranties for each settlement listed on both settlement sites.

"You had a total loss of your vehicle, and you were not reimbursed for any of it by insurance. People in your situation are eligible to claim up to 60% of the Black Book value of your car at the time it was stolen. Call the claims administrator and ask them how to find out the Black Book value (it's not public information, and there's no way for regular people like us to get it -- they should provide it to you or tell you how to proceed without it).

There's an important issue that could affect what you receive: the total amount that Kia (and Hyundai) together are required to pay all of us who have claims is capped at $145 million. If the approved claim amounts are higher than that, everybody's payout will be reduced proportionately to get the total payout under $145 million.

So let's say you file a claim for $7,000 and they approve it, but the total approved claims for everybody combined are 10% higher than $145 million. They will reduce your payout (and everybody else's) by 10%, and you would get $6,300, even though they originally approved you for $7,000. Hope that makes sense.

All of this assumes that your vehicle is covered by this settlement, and that the settlement gets final approval. As of now, it's only a proposed settlement and has not been approved by the court. The court could reject it, and everything would have to start over.",kia

- Graphical User Interface,  
- Apple CarPlay,  
- Android Auto,  
- Navigation, Phone,  
- Radio,  
- Widgets,

###The map data will add the latest address, POI, etc.   
##Some of the older vehicles may only get map data update.  

It could generally match the update changelog in South Korea (https://update.kia.com/KR/KO/updateNoticeView/wRhi9Z), however not always and it'll differ due to region.

You understand Kia owners are never known to exaggerate or read their owners manual,kia
I‚Äôm in Texas in case anybody couldn‚Äôt figure that out,kia
"It means your not connected to kia connect. Sadly I dealt with this for the last 6 months of my lease with no solution since my dealer wouldn't check the phone case number I gave them with all the details and the support supervisor that said he'd call the dealership never succeeded in calling.

If you don't have the October update where they removed modem status button, check it and take some picture to be ready to show/submit to all important parties.",kia
"We bought our 24 Seltos last June. Absolutely love it. Looks great, gas mileage is awesome (31 mpg average since we bought it - has  4000 miles)
Absolutely no problems or issues, fun to drive and suits our needs perfectly. Plan to drive it until it or we die. It replaced a 2014 Hyundai Sonata that we had for 9 years until another driver t-boned my wife and totaled it.

Kia's used to be a joke but they have come a long way.",kia
We paid MSRP plus TTL,kia
ü§ûü§ûü§ûü§ûü§û,kia
I just tape the Kia recall notice about the engine fire problem to the driver side window.,kia
you dont even need anything that breaks it. you just need to pop off the little rubber gasket that hides the ratchet mechanism and shim it open.,kia
I'm not exactly sure how a blanket statement about people who own Kia vehicles is at all relevant to the details of a random recall. Care to enlighten dumb 'ole me?,kia
Hey miles. Not so bad.,kia
Thanks. I just realized it's only when you download that you can see the high-res version.,kia
"For over a year, I was commuting about 50 miles each way, so about 500 miles per week.",kia
"no sir, i didnt like it.",kia
Glad we bought 24 GT2.,kia
"The engine will blow. Some cars are covered by a lifetime warranty, others are not. If you really want this car, take the vin# to a Kia dealer and see if that one is covered or not. It‚Äôs not bad because it is a Kia, it is bad because those engine are horrific at best for many reasons.",kia
The roofline and the body look disjointed at the C pillar. Stylish otherwise.,kia
Honestly can't say I can. Nothing similar or as solid with AWD and heated seats like blue üíô gave blood to the Subaru cult lol an old manual golf tdi would be super fun to dink around in tho,kia
"100 a month, ish, 1250 a year, 2023 Rio, I‚Äôm in Canada so that would work out to about 74 USD a month, only reason it‚Äôs low is because my wife has insurance through her work and I‚Äôm on a group plan, on my own if would be more despite me having a clean driving record for over 25 years",kia
Check in the door where the VIN number is.   If it says it‚Äôs made in Korea then you should be good.   If it says made in Mexico or USA I would pass.   Also check and see if the engine is eligible for replacement.  There was a recall for cars from 2011 to 2020 I think.,kia
Very nice! Unfortunately we don‚Äôt have Telluride‚Äôs in the UK. Biggest Kia they sell here is the Sorrento or EV9.,kia
I got mine in January and am very happy with it my 3rd new Kia after 2 previous Souls,kia
"7 years at 10%, who would have guessed lol",kia
"I'm in the US, in Michigan.",kia
No - US,kia
Your response to someone calling out a lack of data is to comment and again bring no data? Good job!,kia
Put a sign that says AIDS in blood that will work better.,kia
I agree it's absolutely bizarre that people find this look appealing I wish I understood.,kia
I chose gravity grey because of the wheels also being grey. Tinted all the windows to match each other and couldn't be happier,kia
I also didn't realize I couldn't get the 8 seater in the SX which is frustrating,kia
"I dont live in the states but I'll drop the figure in too.

1600‚Ç¨ payed only once per year for a 2018 1.6 Optima SW diesel. So about 133 per month.",kia
"Lol
  Me too",kia
"Wheels are great, but that wrap (I'm assuming it's a wrap) is stunning.",kia
Yes they can deny it lol,kia
"As a kia salesman, congrats, and great color choice! The midnight lake blue is my favorite color on the tellys. Looks like detail forgot to remove the little orange stickers on the wheels though, lmao. Use a plastic razor to remove those",kia
"I‚Äôm crying because my 2017 Optima looks like a pos and I paid that much for it as well üò≠


Honestly I‚Äôd just ask the owner to provide any accident reports as well as a list of things they‚Äôve done with the vehicle. If all checked out, HELL YEAH GET IT.",kia
It's not electric is it?,kia
"You can find online websites or even ebay or facebook marketplace that will have that wheel for sale. The only thing you might need to find is the TPMS sensor and the center cap, both of which shouldn‚Äôt be hard to find or expensive. But no riding on the steel wheel will look bad but won‚Äôt be bad for the car overall",kia
"That‚Äôs good to hear! Mpg isn‚Äôt the biggest factor to me,but I do hate going to the gas station. If I can squeeze out a bit more and avoid filling up even a little bit longer, that‚Äôs good for me!",kia
"Before taking this step, make sure your phone‚Äôs charging port doesn‚Äôt have lint etc in it. I just resolved the same issue for my wife and her complaining about her Sorento.",kia
I forgot to mention that the sound comes from right front of the car. At least that's where i hear it. Beacuse if accelerate it when im standing the sound doesn't show up.,kia
No. I have an LX.,kia
"My friend got his EV6 2 weeks ago in london.  He was telling me that the alarm and key don‚Äôt have the usual ultra wide band chips that other cars have, so earlier to steal the cars.  I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs fixed by now (and yours too) as my car is coming in 8 weeks",kia
"Get it to a dealer. KIA has been replacing countless thousands of the 2.4L motors.¬†

You‚Äôll need to show you‚Äôve done maintenance on it, but aside from that you‚Äôll get a new engine / short block.¬†",kia
Because this is the most unique sedan in years. Maybe decades? Every other sedan has the logo in the center. This one is so different that it earned that off-centered logo.¬†,kia
"Leasing a 2023 GT Line at the moment. Fantastic car. If the 2025 comes in around same price and has a hybrid option, that will definitely be my next lease. Why can‚Äôt Kia put out this same design in EV? üò≠",kia
"Your kia app isn‚Äôt connected the your car by vin #. Go to the App Store if you want it, your salesman should have activated it for you if you bought the car new before you left with it",kia
"Going to see what upcoming oil change reveals before documenting with stealership. Next oil change due @7900 miles, going to keep service intervals at 6k. Mine was no where near as chunky as your post but definitively had a glittery sheen.",kia
Costco rebates are different. A dealership can choose to honor them or not. Manufacturers rebates are obligatory.,kia
">Thank you but I‚Äôm still curious if doing this, it‚Äôs cause air from the outside being pushed into the car. I just want to make sure the smell from my garage is not getting pushed into the vehicle‚Ä¶does that make sense?

It does. But you are overthinking this. It's just moving air over the evaporator core to dry it out.",kia
"Aren't you interested in any Honda, Toyota, Subaru or Mazda vehicles? There's plenty to choose from",kia
"I don‚Äôt like it. The fact it lacks a rear door handle and has a slopping roof makes it look disproportionate. Plastic cladding is out of place. The Rio disappeared, and now their Forte became this, bigger and pricier. This car is the result of financially uneducated consumers that been buying cars out of their budget, financed long term.",kia
"Ray-cuss, but correct.",kia
"New car smell?

Or the off-gassing of possibly toxic chemicals from the materials used to assemble the interior of the car?",kia
"Hate the C pillar. (Pic3) i dkn just looks incomplete. Like they wasn‚Äôt sure how to connect the roof to the body so they just drew a line and called it a day.

Aside from that it looks awesome.",kia
time to trade it in,kia
"$78,000, with one Canadian dollar being worth 74 cents, brings you darn close to $107k.",kia
the steering wheel logo isn‚Äôt centered..,kia
"Go to a dealer and tell them what is going on. Have them read the code. If you are low on oil request an Oil Consumption test. If the dealer is decent they will do it no problem. If they don‚Äôt call Kia or go to another dealer. I also have a 2017 Optima. Was losing oil, took it to dealer. They did what I mentioned. Put in a request with Kia, got approved for new engine and 2 weeks later was all done. Yes, it took about 6 weeks from start to finish but luckily my car still ran. They also gave me a free rental. Not all dealers suck.",kia
"Same. My US built '15 Optima is at 95K miles with the original everything and has no problems. Plus, of the many hundreds of Optima engines my dealer has replaced, there is no bias regarding the origin of the vehicle.¬†",kia
Except if you owe any money on it you're going to screw your credit by doing that,kia
If you pay ahead to where it shows you don‚Äôt owe a payment your are basically paying entirely to principle. I say basically because the first year is roughly 80% towards interest until you hit a certain amount paid.,kia
I can't say. What's the code for?,kia
Yes the vin number is programmed to the ecu and logs everything.,kia
"I don't like all the non cohesive lines, it takes away from any smooth soft lines it so badly needs..   The headlights look like they were borrowed from another product line which is fine but I don't like it, this headlight is soulless, cold if you will.  Vehicle design by Alfa Romeo and Mazda, even lowly Dodge in 2024 look more appealing for the price.   I just can't get over that cut off c piller.   It's horrendous. What happened?",kia
"US$78.00 monthly 2018 Kia Optima EX (Premium), i live in DR tho üá©üá¥",kia
84 a month for a 2023 sorento ex+ in oakville Canada.,kia
"I'm in BC. Got my Sportage PHEV about 7 weeks ago. I did not wait. Found one in Vernon and bought it remotely.  I probably overpaid, but I look at it as an ""impatience tax. 
Op, congrats it's a good ride.",kia
Jesus.....ü§¶,kia
"also, is this a common problem people have with this car? should i worry about the other handles breaking too?",kia
and i got off work and was sitting in the taco bell line for like 30 minutes in sport then i sat in my driveway for a while in sport. that‚Äôs gotta be why,kia
"You'd be surprised actually. With good credit I couldn't get below 10% interest

What I am doing however is I am adding a Canadian immobilizer so that I can get it cheaper interest rate",kia
There is no dealer anywhere near me offering anything less than 10%. My credit is above 800,kia
"If it's a bearing issue and you did not get that update, you're probably in for a bad time.",kia
It might only go up till 2022 with the key ignition but that doesn't mean some dumbass won't try to steal it.,kia
It‚Äôs likely that their system is an automatic system to where  a purchase is made a review link is sent out to the person who made that purchase. The emails about Kia connect are likely the same thing.,kia
"thanks. I heard about the law but still feel we did ok....most of the fees are at least somewhat legit. We ended up right around sticker price which is absolutely not a deal but at least we didn't pay the $3500 ""package"" they were offering. I'm usually obsessive about getting a deal but at my age, I've lost some of the fight.",kia
4 door looks like 2 door. Do u know ms price?,kia
"Kumos are nice but i swapped mine at 49k miles. 

I have a 2020 kia forget gt-line.

What you want are michelin cross climate 2‚Äôs. You will thank me later.

Hurts mpg by 3 mpg but it makes the car drive like it has AWD",kia
"Don't regret it, it's a good car.",kia
"Sounds good, hopefully this helps. I did see it is possible to soft reset the vehicle's communication device that way. Anything beyond that is up to a dealership to resolve.",kia
"Yes, first owner. I may have some records - we are away on vacation so nothing on me. I don‚Äôt think I got that update",kia
"my girlfriend has a 2010 base model soul. She makes me drive it for roadtrips and gosh does it feel unsteady to drive that thing past 55 mph. The amount of wind from other cars pushing against is crazy. You legit cannot keep it centered all the time because of it. And ngl, all smaller CUVs do that it seems like unfortunately. Sedans ftw üòÇ",kia
"EX has built in Nav.  Complimentsry for like a year, subscription after that.",kia
"You're misinformed.  You're thinking of charging cycles probably.  Discharging 100 -> 0 and then charging 0 -> 100 is one cycle.  What a lot of people get wrong is, the following is also one cycle, doing 100 -> 80 and 80 -> 100, then 100 -> 50 and 50 -> 100, then 100 -> 70 and 70 -> 100.  Charging more frequently doesn't use up more cycles.",kia
I have a 24 Sportage SXP which came with a stock immobilizer therefore Kia boys can‚Äôt take it,kia
"I actually do too, but whats with the wheel arcs?",kia
I also own a forte,kia
It means the Hat Man is coming to see you soon,kia
I purchased my car in Oct 2022.,kia
"In 2013, there was this taxi company in my town that used the Ceed Caravan as its fleet. At the time, I got hooked on the design of the ProCeed. Started digging around to see if it was actually a good car. Turns out, taxi drivers loved it for its reliability. In 2013 Auto Build did a test of 100 cars and the need for repairs after 5 years. It concluded that the ProCeed, along with some BMW model, barely ever broke down. So, I bought a 2009 ProCeed in 2014 with just 30k km on it. Still driving it today. It's up to 150k km now and hasn't given me a single major issue, just regular service stuff. I'm at a point where I could get a new car, but every time I take this one on a road trip, I just don't see the point. Decided to use my savings on international travel instead. Save travels my friend!",kia
"Your comment kinda contradicts itself. 

Knowing how to work on and fix means your spending money and time fixing it. What happens if he needs a reliable car for work but his transmission goes out on a monday and has to  pull the transmission out and rebuild it. And in the process of removing the transmission he snaps the head of a bolt among other issues. 

Or he takes it to a shop that is 9/10 going to rip him off and do a poor job fixing it. Now he has to take it back over and over until they get it right if they even work on it. 

While i normally go the route of buying cheap cars myself. I can definitely see why someone would want a new car. Nothing like the peace of mind knowing your car is problem free and with a warranty.",kia
"I don't even put 4,000 miles on my car in 6 months",kia
Take my monthly payments üòÇ,kia
"I call BS. $107,000 financed (CAD)? Even the top trim is $78,000... more to the story.",kia
Wrong country.  We don't deal with the north.  We deal with the south.,kia
"Wow. That sucks. Good luck fixing it.

I keep my credit locked except when I'm intentionally applying for things to prevent exactly this kind of horror story",kia
Oh oups sorry about that boot,kia
Thank you for this! My dad was worried about commuting to work so he wanted to quickly have the engine replaced & didn‚Äôt want to deal with the dealership because he didn‚Äôt want to spend extra $ on a diagnosis since his mechanic said it has to be the engine. Good to know it‚Äôs best to take it to the dealership first & then see what happens.,kia
God damn that is one good looking vehicle.,kia
"If its right hand drive, then its europe, they dont have kia boyz",kia
"My proceed gt has it aswell,its cooling the engine",kia
Damn did you buy it used? Yeah heard about people stealing them that‚Äôs one of the main things I‚Äôm worried about,kia
"Here‚Äôs what I do at a 26yo male in Palm Beach County with an at fault accident in the past 5 years. 

I get quotes online from AAA, Allstate, Gieco, Liberty Mutual, Progressive, and State Farm. I don‚Äôt go through an agent, I try to buy it direct when available. 

Farmers and Costco used to be on the list before they stopped writing policies in Florida. 

I have 25/50/50 (more than the state minimum) and for here uninsured motorist is a must. 500 deductibles because it‚Äôs barely any more money than a higher deductible. Personal Injury Protection with 0 Deductible, With Relatives and Work Loss. 

I have the benefit of having a short commute and being a low-mileage driver. However I work late and with most of my driving being after dark ‚Äútracking‚Äù with a phone app or device discount is declined. 

I had one quote at $2800 and Two quotes under $800 all for the same coverage. This is as of Thursday since my 6 month renewal was coming. 

You get a discount for shopping at least a week ahead of your renewal. 

In the end when for the same coverage my quotes vary over $2000 it really feels like a dice game.",kia
$60 a month 23 sportage ex. It's bundled with my homeowners. And I'm in my late 50s with no accidents or tickets.,kia
I'm in love with it. I'll probably make a post myself talking about it lol,kia
"Apparently it's now showing the right code for it to be covered...

SUSPICIOUS",kia
A bad decision compounded by more bad decisions. Most likely rolling bad debt into bad debt. ü§¶,kia
$110 per month with Progressive for my 2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid SXP. $500 deductible.,kia
"I live in a rural area and for us, it‚Äôs perfectly normal to have that high milage. I‚Äôve got a coworker that has had his car less than 2 years and already has over 60,000 miles on it. My longest commute was 140 miles round trip working 6 days a week. I‚Äôve had many other 100+ mile commutes as well.",kia
"this here, if the engine breaks you may be denied a warranty replacement if there are aftermarket engine parts",kia
"Not amber DRL, but 'side marker' or 'parking' lamps. The first click on the selector. They act as clearance lamps.",kia
Is it new though? It sounds more like a cash price.,kia
Probably because i drive quickly not like a grandpa but afaik ik hilly terrain affects also.,kia
"Hey proceed buddy,i have the proceed 1.6 gt.
i love the car so much and i have tuned it to 250 hp,tbh what it original neededüòä",kia
It‚Äôs like Ford steering wheels in the early 90‚Äôs.,kia
It's a RHD. I'm sure it'll confuse the Kia Boyz.,kia
"Those wheels are sic. Can't tell how the back doors open, makes it mysterious. Design language reminds a lot of if they ""uncrossed"" the Sportage back down from and SUV to a sedan, especially looking at the DRL's and backend, and the cabin layout. If they make it sub $20K I think it will sell like crazy. I wonder what the powertrain is.",kia
That's crazy expensive! Are you in GTA lol?,kia
"A reset actually can do that. As I'm sure that you're happily learning!

How long have you had the car? Or do you know the last time a power-disconnect reset occurred? There may be clues in your answer to the question: if a reset can help that much, should I do it once in a while on my car, too?",kia
Just watched the Prelude and yes... It looks amazing!,kia
"If the battery was charged and you drive in EV mode you can use zero gas (under good conditions) in that case it shows 999mpg.  It feels like it has a lot of power from the EV motor, unlike a gas motor it has instant torque at 0 rpm. It you drove the Niro EV or EV6 you would really be blown away by the instant power. 

But if you are thinking about buying a PHEV be prepared to charge it daily at your house. Too many people buy one then can't charge it or charging it all the time becomes a hassle so they stop plugging it in. In that case they could have saved $4000 and bought the plain hybrid.",kia
Its nice,kia
"First of all, you have to opt in for this to even matter. Second, it‚Äôs only for certain Kia models. It sounds like you may have one of those models so if you made the choice to opt in and you have bad driving habits, then, yes you should be worried.",kia
"Gravity.  Kia uses (maybe still) an"" eco friendly"" water based paint. Keeping it on is harder than Keeping it clean",kia
Run his ass over lol,kia
"It can be done, but it's a lot harder and rough on the clutch. Need to use parking brake.",kia
JFC - you could get a new car with insurance for a couple hundred more.,kia

Thanks !  Decisions Decisions,kia
But they have an engine immobilizer installed now where the susceptible Kias didn't,kia
"I'm the same ,can't do it, unless its first class,  highly unlikely.",kia
"The car should come with an EVSE that you can plug into a regular electric outlet to charge your car.  The only downside is charging speed, 110V x 12A = 1.3kW, so it'll take about 10 hours to fully charge the battery.  The Sportage is capable of charging at 7.2kW, so you could purchase separately and install a wall box that is either hardwired or uses a NEMA 14-50 plug, charging at 32A. That'll hit the Sportage's max charge speed, letting you fully charge in 2 hours.  I don't know how solar panels can factor into all of this, someone else will need to help you with that.",kia

"This is dependent on your year, make and model. I was told they don‚Äôt offer it for my vehicle- at all. And an aftermarket install could void my warranty. I was told my the 800 Kia customer service representative that Kia has no control over insurance policies, so it‚Äôs not their fault. I‚Äôm facing paying outrageous insurance prices or trading in my vehicle for a different car maker.

Just be prepared to have your car broken into. All older models can easily be broken into. You can find videos on YouTube and TikTok about how kids broke into Kia‚Äôs with just a USB. All newer models past a 2018 or 19 are the better option if I remembered correctly.,kia

"Agreed with comment above. Kia/Hyundai make it difficult to apply extra payments to the principal. For now, stop making those extra payments until you call them.

"I'm a new Kia owner myself, but have you tried reinstalling the app and signing in while you are in the car and it is turned on? If even that doesn't work, your car has fallen out of sync with the satellite it communicates with for the app to work. I believe each Kia with this functionality has a 'modem' of some kind.

"It looks like Rochester has an interactive ""public crime map"". I didn't study it closely, but it looks like you might be able to isolate vehicle thefts for certain date ranges, so you might be able to derive totals for each month of, say, the past two years. That would reveal any trends. I think it's safe to assume that any major upswing in the period from early 2022 to now would be driven by Kia/Hyundai thefts, and any major drop off would reflect falling Kia/Hyundai thefts as well.

Trends prior to spring 2022 probably don't reflect Kia/Hyundai thefts, since the TikTok thing didn't really take hold in most places until 2022.

You can access the map from this page:

"Have a 23 SXP HEV with 13k miles.
Was looking at minivans back in 2022 but the market for those was and is still is crazy.

I like how it's a lot of car for the money. A top trim Kia is much more affordable and tech-packed than a comparable Toyota/Honda. Like the 6 seat configuration - big but not too big. 2nd row captains chairs work well and are heated. MPG is great. Averaging 31 over life of car, less in winter and more in summer. Has plenty of power for normal world driving. 

Cons are... the Hybrid system isn't as sophisticated as a Toyota. The 6-speed transmission is good, but there are times where the system isn't as refined as a Toyota. Brake pedal can be non-linear. EV mode gets confused when going uphill from a standing stop.

No regrets so far though. Has been a solid family vehicle.",kia

Had 164k miles a year ago now 175k. I‚Äôm gonna keep it as my back up car and like my work car where I keep all my tools and use my new car as my good car. 

It really sucks to get screwed over and you don‚Äôt have any options because you put all your money into what you thought was gonna be a decent car. so pissed when I paid for the Ford and it broke down on the way home.

"The OP did not say that they have defaulted on the loan; it's possible they have still been making payments on the amount they owe.

And the finance company is entitled only to the outstanding balance of the loan. If the OP receives more than that in a settlement, then obviously they should keep the remainder. 

I get your point about loan defaults raising costs for everyone, but plenty of good, responsible people default on debts due to major setbacks over which they have little or no control like getting laid off, or market crashes, or huge medical bills. Others, of course, are just irresponsible. There's gray areas.",kia

Couple thousand less than the civic and/or corolla. I think your 17 year old will enjoy the car.  The CVT is much better and smoother than a Toyota CVT, though I think Toyota still has the edge in reliability. But you will be okay warranty wise!  The forte is here to stay and is being rebadged to the K4 soon so I would not worry about it being discontinued any time soon. There is still a need for small sub compact cars and Kia/Hyundai believe in this class based on how they constantly update the Forte/Elantra class of vehicles.",kia

A full load EV9 GT is 82,300 in Canada, plus fees and taxes, possibly even luxury taxes.

They might also have a trade they're very underwater on, or bought a bunch of product in the back (undercoating, protectection packages, 3m, extended warranty, etc) - or paid above MSRP due to scarcity.

The interest rate sucks which could be accounted for because of a deeply underwater trade or bad credit, or both.

Ultimately they had 20+ opportunities and multiple hours to say no and change their mind  when they saw what their payments would be - but at the end of the day they're adults that can do what they want.",kia

"P1326 can occur regardless of a theft incident.
These engines are prone to fail which is why there is an extended warranty to replace engines that fail. The requirements are to have up to date maintenance records and the knock sensor detection system (KSDS) software up to date.¬†


P1326 results in two outcomes:¬†
- Misdiagnosis, meaning the software update was not done and it is giving a false alert and just needs to be updated or have the knock sensor replaced.¬†
- Engine is knocking, meaning the engine is done for and needs to be replaced. If you are the original owner, have maintenance records and have had the KSDS update done, you are likely to have it covered under warranty.¬†",kia

"You can call the claims administrator and ask questions: (844) 966-2773

You're going to have to call them anyway, since they are the only ones who can tell you what your car was worth on the day it was stolen -- they pay based on the Black Book fair market value, and that information is not available to the general public.

They will probably tell you to get your police report, and submit it to them. Are you sure you have to pay for it? I'm not aware of any places where the police charge victims for copies of their police report, but I could be wrong. Even if it's free, it may be a hassle to get it, so I hope you're patient. üôÇ

You can also ask them about the money that you still owe to the bank. Technically, the bank has a lien on your car, and can claim part of your settlement to pay off your loan. If you had been insured, and the insurance company had paid you for your stolen car, they would have paid the bank first, and then given you whatever was left over.

Right? Ok. Replacing the inner and outer on one side is possible, as far as I know. However, we don't know the condition of the rest of the system. Is the other side seized too? Does the other side have any play in it's joints? Also need to consider the cost and availability of parts. It could very well cost more to replace one inner and outer tie rod than to replace the whole rack with a reman unit that includes all 4 new. Maybe the inner tie rod is not available, or not soon, and they're considering the time your car will be down.

But both times after 3-6 months I've transferred the financing to a credit union for better rates and better customer service. Just make sure you tell them when you purchase the car that you want a loan that doesn't have a penalty for early pay off. I think that depends on what state the purchase is made in. But for most dealerships, they will ask that you make three payments at least because that's how long it takes for them to get their kickback for sending you to Kia's finance arm. I have waited that time to be nice to them for offering me a deal/rebate and then I refinanced with a credit union I have a longstanding relationship with that gives me excellent rates and doesn't give me the runaround trying to make extra payments.",kia

Still hard to believe what you get on a new KIA for this price.",kia
"I have a niro Hybrid  relatively new so can't comment on reliability just yet. I do know that the one thing with Kia hybrids that eventually fail are the DCT transmission and/or hybrid power control unit. Not before 100k miles though. 

 Make sure you do the maintenance like replacing the clutch actuator fluid at the suggested intervals to look after the car. 


 I do live in a place with winters and honestly it's been fine. Engine is a little louder when cycling but I expect that. Make sure to use 0w-20. The engine kicks on most of the time because when you have the heat in the cabin it will always activate the engine. Your mpg will decrease quite a bit because of it. I average 35-40s in the winter. 50-55 in the summers. For a 20 mile commute I think your car will be okay.",kia

"Looks like that was the problem, my app didn‚Äôt auto update so I updated it and it works again. Thanks for the info",kia
Price is largely area dependent but doesn't jump out as outrageous to me. Transmission fluid every 15k is way overkill. Every 60k would be more standard.,kia
"Almost bought one, I've worked for kia for many years when they first came out. I can try and answer any questions you have about it",kia
"It's very risky to buy an old car like that with so many miles and no warranty.  


Are you willing to take such a big risk?  


And do you have a buffer amount of money needed to repair and maintain this car?",kia
"That's not true, at least where I am. All of my statements since January have showed $0 owed, but all of my payments since then still have a pretty significant amount going to interest, especially considering I am making $100 extra payments each month.",kia
Lollll,kia
180 a month for liability 21 years old couple tickets on a 2016 optima and car is paid for,kia
"The cap is what's broken, not the handle. Without the cap the handle can come out. Fix it or replace the cap. You can put the handle back in and use it with having it slip out, but it's not secure.¬†",kia
What was the resolution for yours?,kia
