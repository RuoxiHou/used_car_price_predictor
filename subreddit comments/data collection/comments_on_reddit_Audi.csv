Lol that's the best way to see how many BMW fanboys will go with Audi and Audi fans with BMW this will make my final choice more interesting!,Audi
"I liked the Q4 e tron as a compact SUV EV. The interior does not scream EV with huge tablets and no buttons. It has a HUD where many EV‚Äôs don‚Äôt that I was looking into. 

It rode better than the ID.4 I test drove. The exterior looks refined as well. 

My nephew told his mom ‚Äúthis is something Aunt xxx would buy‚Äù so it‚Äôs right up my alley.",Audi
"this was my method, but still ended up paying a car note for insurance with only 1 speeding ticket ever on my recordüôÇ$350/mo on insurance for my old 2016 A6, $450 now on my S6",Audi
It should get the Gen 4 EA888 on the base/non-S models,Audi
"For sure. From a purely aesthetic standpoint I can‚Äôt argue that debadged isn‚Äôt better. Especially on late models. Late models have so many lines and creases (especially on the bumpers/grill) and over complicated designs that debadging is a way to make them less distracting/busy to the eye.

As per the usual, if you like it, then do it. I would just put the badges back on if you‚Äôre looking to sell/trade ya know.",Audi
"You can still get the current generation 4 cylinder A4 in a manual in the US. 

I definitely didn‚Äôt know they made manual Q3s ü§Ø",Audi
"We have the RS3 Sedan over here already, if they were ever going to bring the hatchback RS3 here they would have done it already. With the new EPA guidelines this week on how many EV‚Äôs/Hybrids need to be produced for every ICE vehicle, it doesn‚Äôt make any sense for them to introduce more RS‚Äôs to NortH America.

There may be one more cosmetic refreshes of the RS3 2.5 but at some point soon it‚Äôs either going to EV or get killed off entirely. Unfortunately this is the reality of motoring in 2024.",Audi
"Comfort mode is not an eco setting. Comfort softens your ride, makes the wheel easier to steer and in the D mode.

Sport and Drive transmission controls the throttle response and shift points.

When in S, it idles at a higher RPM and shifts later. Since it sits at higher RPMS, you feel that response quicker, but it uses up more gas.

So by putting in Comfort mode and S transmission. You still get the softened ride (adaptive dampers, chasis control), quicker steering and now the car's transmission is quicker to respond.

I drive in Comfort S sometimes",Audi
"I do love the M4, but after driving both brands, I'd have the Audi.",Audi
"Get the grey , white will need a wash every week",Audi
Not gonna lie these wheels r kinda crazy tho,Audi
For a regular A6 with 50k miles?!? That‚Äôs S6 money with half the miles,Audi
Both are stunning!,Audi
"Thanks, this is exactly the kind of info I'm looking for.",Audi
"I love the ride, I‚Äôm just not a fan of stickers, prefer to be a sleeper. Other than that, respect.",Audi
"Also, I told him a good 3-4 times, I am ok I do not need it.",Audi
Looks terrible. The car is insanely beautiful. Take it off,Audi
"Remember when EVs were the fastest cars going down a drag strip?  Now they can't keep up with ICE cars.

Add the ""it's a manufacturing issue that takes 15 minutes to fix."" build quality and response to problems on top of that and you really get an idea of how stupid cybertrucks owners are.

""The car comes unpainted and ready to rust but you can pay extra to have the thing painted.""  Sounds a lot like ""you need to pay extra to have the manufacturing process of the truck actually completed.""",Audi
Poke out oil screen on the cam bridge it will only cause problems.,Audi
"I think economics will win in the end.  Honeymoon EV phase is over, although the government tried to mandate, automakers would go broke shoving EVs down our throats.  Most can't afford a new EV nor do they want to deal with the inadequate charging network.  I think there will be a happy medium where new cars are hybrid with a performance 4 or 6 cyl",Audi
Fucking awesome ü§£,Audi
"That's such a nonsense internet myth for new cars.

My wife's last Range Rover, a 2014 Sport, did 120,000 miles in 10 years and we paid $4,000 in repair costs (outside of consumables - oil, tires, etc). It never once left us stranded and in need of a tow.

My RS6 left me stranded last week when the 48v generator went (as they all do every \~20k miles). It will do the same at \~40k miles as there is no modified part. It also left me stranded when a tire went as there isn't a spare (unlike the Range Rover).

With Range Rovers, my experience has been that you need a good specialist to look after them and avoid the dealerships when the warranty is done. With any $100k+ car the bills are going to be big when things go wrong and you just need to know that. Even the consumables are expensive - hello $5,000 for brakes every 25k miles on an RS6.

The bad reputation comes from people who spend $10k on a 10 year old Range Rover, A8, or S class merc as it's a 'bargain' and are then shocked at the cost isn't the same as a Ford when their air suspension goes wrong.

I'm ok with high running costs and expect it on expensive luxury cars. I'm not ok with being stranded and I've never called a tow truck in a Range Rover.",Audi
Lame,Audi
Not the smartest purchase,Audi
No idea but it‚Äôs probably expensive üò≠,Audi
"This happened to me when I bought my previous Audi.  Finance offered it, I declined, then when I went to get a service done at an Audi dealership closer to me they said it was covered by my Audi care.  Audi care stays with the VIN not the individual fyi",Audi
Yeah except for the hunting green,Audi
"Timing chain, burning oil, carbon cleanup, probably 5k
Plus some suspension pieces. Then your good till the water pump goes every now and then.",Audi
GT3/4 RS would like a word with you,Audi
"The R8 used to be a cheaper super car with almost all the same prestige as its competitors that were 1.5x its price. Also it was a headturner in its own distinct aesthetic.¬†

¬†Nowadays with inflation, prices are reaching 200k easy for many models that would have never a half decade ago. And they look damn good but not even half as well as they perform. Not even mentioning the cars half its msrp that outperform it.

Not a surprise at all, but it‚Äôll surely be missed.",Audi
"It is Italy, where would they park?",Audi
It's my winter wheels üòä,Audi
"I'd love to have this positive outlook. 

I see as automakers will barely survive and will build shitty small SUVs that we will only rent/lease and be able to buy lol",Audi
My radio stuck too towards the end.  In cold winters it wouldn‚Äôt pop open until summers.  I never bothered to deal with it the motor mechanism still worked it was just temperamental if it would power up,Audi
Hideous.,Audi
"I think the MK1 looks nice, but it is far from modern in its design. I but more bubbly than the later designs.",Audi
"I'm in NJ and these fuckers raise it every year saying sorry lots of accidents, soon Insurance will match the car note",Audi
If you can‚Äôt work on old German cars yourself they are even more expensive to own.,Audi
"I have a 2022 BRZ and I have to disagree about the handling. The WRX definitely isn‚Äôt going to handle as well because it has a higher center of gravity. But my BRZ is so fun to drive, it stays planted to the ground around turns and feels fantastic to drive",Audi
My og 2018 S4 had ceramic tint 30% on all but the windshield and it was wonderful. When that was totaled last March I had to get another audi and put 30% ceramic on it as well. The reduction of infrared alone keeps the interior decent before the AC kicks on in the summer. I've driven 14k in the last year and I highly recommend tint simply for comfort. The added night time security and UV elimination to avoid sunburn from 4hr trips is a bonus. I feel like it's an investment into reducing the wear on the AC system as well.,Audi
For iOS mobile click search bar and edit will appear too right corner,Audi
Yeah,Audi
Mine leaks oil on my driveway.,Audi
The configurator makes this color look awful but now seeing this I think I‚Äôll go for it on my next Audi instead of plasma blue.,Audi
I also own a 1.6HDI with 320.000kms and it is also very great. It does 65mpg so can‚Äôt complain,Audi
"When I started my career I had a B5 S4 pinned to the cork board over my desk.  They moved on to the B6, and I thought it was a dream that slipped away.  Then it came up in a conversation one day and a coworker mentioned a friend of his had one for sale.  I was like, nah, you're wrong.  But I'll check it out.  Sure enough, it was a Nogaro Blue B5 S4, a doctor's wife was driving it to the grocery store on Sundays.  I got it in 2010 with 37k on the clock.  

Anyway after that I swapped in a pic of a red R8.  I'm still holding out hope, although it's significantly less likely it's being used as a grocery getter.",Audi
Agreed,Audi
"These, I think.

"I have Glacier White with Black Optics Plus and Magma Red seats, and so do I.",Audi
"How‚Äôs the condition of the paint?  PPF? If no ppf, are there a few or a lot of rock chips in the front? How‚Äôs the interior? Driver seat lateral bolster looking good or creased and worn? How‚Äôs the rocker panel cover, clean or scratched to hell? 

I know this is entirely anecdotal and unscientific, but I judge how a car was treated by the cosmetic appearance lol. A car with PPF all over and in pristine aesthetic condition inside and outside suggests the owner was careful and thoughtful and therefore more likely to have done good maintenance work and less likely to have done *bad things*. 

Also check the tires. At 49K miles I‚Äôm guessing the original tires that came on the car has been replaced. If you see the original tires still on there with some ok tread, that most likely means those 49K miles were super gentle highway cruising miles. That‚Äôs a win. If the replacement tires are good quality (reputable UHP AS category tires, summer tires, etc) then that‚Äôs good. If it‚Äôs some shit brand knock off tires I‚Äôd instantly not consider the car.


Edit: upon closer inspection those look to be ProContact TX tires which are oem!  Wow",Audi
"Honestly the new lights and wireless CarPlay were enough for me to sway toward new, but that‚Äôs just me.",Audi
Probably about 350 at the crank. It's got a K04 turbo which makes it pretty fun.,Audi
Take it off,Audi
Ya those types of generalizations aren‚Äôt going to get you far in life,Audi
What A Guy! You think it‚Äôs possible to walk into a Audi/VW dealership and ask what services exactly were performed based on don VIN?,Audi
"Easy cat to love. Especially in the shape it's in. Took my buddy to get an a4 sat, his wasnt in such great shape. But it's a Lil newer.",Audi
"You got a 7y old car and still plan on doing it tho. The guy that buys it new won't even remove the dealer stupid license plate holder.


Plus that's a 6 series, people with that money don't change their tires, let alone debadge a new car.


The 1% chance the guy did it on purpose, it's if a kid wanted the rs6 but his parents ""only bought him the a6"" instead, so he debadges it in shame lol but then why a avant?",Audi
Rs6.. more unique..,Audi
"Can confirm this. I‚Äôve seen the myAudi registration portal do all kinds of crazy stuff. RS3 with 2.0T, Q3 with 4.0T V8, SQ5 with 3 Electric motors

Nothing about this car is practical. It‚Äôs an old luxury car. And it looks abused‚Ä¶.,Audi
"Never a bad idea to change both out. 

And don‚Äôt go to a dealership to do rotors/pads lol",Audi
"Beautiful car, welcome to the family",Audi
"This is my take. I‚Äôm upgrading and am past my M3 or M4 phase in life. I‚Äôm middle aged and it would be my daily driver. M4 maybe as a second car. I do like spinning the tires on RWD, but not that much.",Audi
"Very nice! Congrats!


How do you like the seats?¬† I've got the plain standard ones in my B9.",Audi
"20% or 30% a must. I would go with 30% I do find my 20% a little too dark as I never had tint before, will definitely give it more sporty and aggressive feel",Audi
My old A6 is what tempted me to buy my S6,Audi

Yup,Audi
Idk why but I hate/like it. Mad at myself,Audi
Smooth brain question. Which design do you like better? You like the redesign? Wait. Do you not like the redesign? Buy now. This isn't a hard thing and isn't something you need a bunch of random internet people to decide for you.,Audi

"Have you driven one?  Been awhile since I cross shopped a Lexus but last time I looked..

I was really shocked how poorly the space is utilized in the IS/GS models.  The center stack is too wide and I lack space for my knees.  I also hate the interfaces that Lexus uses.  It just doesn't feel good to navigate menus or get to stuff.

They're also slow compared to their german competition",Audi
"honestly, I didn't even have to try that hard, this was the first dealer I went too, I knew I would need at least 10% off MSRP to get to the payment I wanted, took a little back and fourth, didn't even have the Costco discount either.

Might've helped it was a rainy Saturday later into the month, plus I've heard its been slow at alot of dealers with the economy and not alot of people having extra $$. They also had I think 4-5 S5 SB's on lot",Audi
They‚Äôve lost the plot. I‚Äôll be shopping for a B9-9.5 then lol,Audi

I bought all new badges from Amazon and eBay. They come with mounting tape. They were not expensive except the custom made A3 badges.,Audi
Steering wheel is from @askcarbon they're legit and can build you whatever you want reach out through their Instagram account and go from there.,Audi
"In my meaningless opinion:

When I see a debadged non performance model (not S, RS, M, AMG, etc) I get the impression that the owner has removed their badges to shy away from the fact that their model is not a performance model yet wants to show that their car is fast by driving it as if it is a performance model. And by driving it like it is a performance model (maybe tuning it also) they are typically more harsh on their car. Nobody wants to buy a car that gives the implication that it‚Äôs been abused. 

Tbh this is mostly speculation and although I have personally witnessed debadged lower trims driving like idiots (more than I have seen performance models) I have no other evidence.",Audi

Try with all your might to get the b8.5 model even wait and save a bit more .... superior looking car and ergonomics and still looks fresh today... resale value will hold up better too ... im in the UK and an s5 2014 would be around 13-17k¬£  so a lesser model would be touching 10k on a b8.5 ... but as I say a UK car ....and we dont get those horrendous orange indicators in the headlights lol,Audi

"No worries. Congrats on the car, it‚Äôs actually a fantastic vehicle. I had a buddy who let me borrow his 12 cylinder one (if that exists?) but it looked just like this back in sf a few years ago.

"I still my enjoy my '21 STI.  It's slow, but I definitely feel a lot more connected to driving the car than any of my Audis.  Owning Audis you forget about what steering wheel feedback is.  Definitely more isolation from the road and the outside compared to Subies.",Audi

"Don't trust my wife - she panics and want to call a tow truck when the washer fluid light comes on!

Luxury cars are going to less reliable full stop. Audi sold 75,000 Q5's last year in the US. They sold 750 RS6s. The Q5 engine and systems are shared by dozens of other VAG products and are tried and tested. The RS6/RS7 systems are unique or shared with a handful of low volume cars. There are way more systems and tighter tolerances in a RS6 than a Q5. All that 'stuff' that costs the extra $90k over the Q5 is low volume and wants to go wrong! It is going to go wrong more often. This all dings the scores.

People are also a lot more picky when spending $150k on a car and the service department is a lot more interested in the random rattles, bad stitching and issues on RS6 than they were on a cheaper car.

Any other luxury car is going to have the same issue, Range Rover included.",Audi

I'm curious -- if you've worked on the A8 in that series range '06 to '12, what would you say are the most common problems you encountered?

That said BMW makes a hell of a driver's car and Audi can't quite match their chassis feel, if you are tracking or just buying it as a toy BMW will have the edge here.

Its a cop out answer but drive them both and buy the one you liked the feel of best.  No offense, but most people won't put these vehicles even close to their limits to where any of the professional reviews about chassis rotation or any of that shit matters.",Audi
"Hey OP, as someone who had an A car before an RS, if you enjoy it, go ahead. I know people feel like the red is exclusive to S/RS but that's just audi's marketing goal, the fact that so people feel that way show how effective it is. Normally people don't gate keep like this but I was surprised to see you getting down voted for all of this. I think it's an unique touch and if this unique touch makes you enjoy the car more, then no matter what people think, it's a great idea. the car is for you to enjoy.

on my a4, I have a black s-line front grill badge that has a tiny bit of red on it and I love it. It's tuned to a stock S4 power so even if people make an upbadge argument, to me it has a better power to weight ratio than a stock S4 and it has a proper DSG.

As mentioned by everyone else, it's not a new car. 10 years of EV development has changed quite a few things (cue the EX30 above...) So a new R8 E-tron would most likely perform a little bit better.

"Comfort/Auto mode provides 7 inches (178 mm) of height and is the standard ride height. The Allroad setting levels at 8.2 in. (208 mm) and is also the fixed ride height of the SQ5 and Q5 standard suspension. In Lift/Offroad mode the SQ5 sits at 9 in. (228 mm). Dynamic mode sits at 6.4 in. (163 mm). There‚Äôs a switch in the cargo area that when pressed will drop the SQ5 a couple inches (50 mm) to make it easier to load and unload items in the trunk. The ride height adjusts automatically based on the mode and the speed that you are traveling.

Found this on an Audi Forum, doesn't look like there is a separate control for the ride height if you did have the optional suspension. In the united states Red calipers come with air suspension as part of the ""s sport package""

"When the M4 came out 2014/2015, the M4 interior was way better than the RS5, but when both models got a refresh (Audi 2017 & BMW late 2017), the Audi had much better technology in terms of the gauge cluster display, it was quite ahead of its time. However, the BMW M4 has lots of hidden technology as well right from the onset, the heads up display was easily the best on the market upon release as well. 

M4 also has a lot more interior carbon fiber trim. The infotainment can be improved by a $600 full android display upgrade that can make it do practically anything. It remains to be seen if the BMW's mostly analog gauge cluster or the Audi's digital cluster will age better years from now.",Audi

I'm pondering swapping my C7 A6 seats to S6 seats, and the seats are about $2k on eBay.

"Some notes:

Find a mechanic garage that specializes in German cars. I personally bring my Audis to a motorsports garage that specializes in Audis in Minnesota. Their labor rates will always be cheaper than the dealer and their mechanics will be far more seasoned on the specifics of your car than anyone else.

People often neglect brake fluid flushes. These should be done every 2 -3 years. I believe Audi recommends every 2 years. Its only like $200 and helps prolong your brake system and maintain its performance.

Engine braking is fine so long as the drive is full engaged, if you are riding the clutch pedal you will do premature wear on your clutch which is more expensive to repair/maintain than brakes.

Tires are the single most important performance component on any car. For these cars I recommend Michelin Pilot Sport 3 or 4 All Seasons (A/S) or a combination winter and summer set that you swap.

There are several ECU tunes for this car that are available. I personally prefer GO APR Stage 1 ECU Tune for the B8.5 A4s. However there are plenty of other reputable tuners. If you do an ECU tune, start with stage 1 and I would encourage you to have the tune set for 91 Octane even though 93 Octane will get more power. A 91 Octane tune can run 93 Octane fuel, but a 93 Octane tune CANNOT run 91 octane fuel.

OBDEleven is a affordable bluetooth adapter technology that you can use to unlock hidden features and code out annoyances. I use it to turn off the seatbelt alert chime in my Audis as I constantly drive them on frozen lakes where I do not use seatbelts. VCDS RossTech is the gold standard of Audi car to computer interfacing.

Regarding temperature of engine, the car is fine to drive almost instantly. However I tend to wait a half a minute. You will note that your rpms on a cold start will be higher for about 30 seconds before they go down, this is normal. You will also note that when you begin driving for the first time you may feel a click or hear a quiet thunk as you pass I believe 15 mph. This is normal, its the handling systems performing a self test. DO NOT allow the RPMS to get high until the engine is warmed up. The primary concern for me is ensuring the turbo charger gets warmed up before I force it to work hard. It has moving components that often rotate at several times the speed of your engine. In the summer it should be warmed up enough in 5 - 10 minutes of driving, in the winter it can take a substantial amount of time to properly warm up.",Audi

"If you‚Äôre looking for a better sports car, I agree, M4 is the better option here. Especially for people who are looking to maximize their sports car budget.

if you want a 911, but can‚Äôt afford a 911, then I‚Äôd buy the M4.

"I had an M4 before, now driving Rs5 sportback. For daily, I would pick the RS5, for weekend I would choose the M4. For me the M4 suspension is a bit stiffer compared to RS5. I think the massage seat is worth mentioning on the RS5. Another thing is RS5 would be faster at redlight 0-60 due to the Quattro AWD. The steering feel: I would give it to BMW. For handling: both car are doing great, very quick to act. Test drive both to see what you like. Your money, your choice",Audi

I sold it to another guy through bring a trailer in 2020, you can look it up on there to see pictures.

The B8 has one of the best looking tail light design ever made. Why ruin it with some aftermarket shit?,Audi
"Common and most expensive issues is the suspension. These cars came with air suspension and it's pricey to fix. The control arms and such are aluminum and very pricey.

Outside of that, depends on the engine. The 3.0T is bulletproof outside of the coolant system, and the breather valve that mixes the coolant an oil. If it's a V8, well that one can bite you with the timing chain guides and oil leaks. They require engine out for several procedures.

Overall they are great cars. But when you buy one with 178k sight unseen by the looks of it... I mean it's like playing Russian Roulette",Audi

"If you want a more ""tech-focused"" experience, (potentially) more powerful \*and\* fuel-efficient engines out of the box, and most-likely more subdued design, I would wait for the B10 A5 to be announced later this year and see what you think. If you like the more analog interior feel of the current model, want ""edgier"" design, and want to have the typical benefits of an older model (easier to find cheaper, ""proven"" reliability, easier to modify), then I'd go for a B9/B9.5 model.  


I was considering this myself in mid-2022 and then decided to just place an order for the current model and see what details were announced for B10 by then. It's been two years and the only things that have been officially confirmed by now are that the A5 is fully replacing the A4 and it'll be revealed later this year lol. I'm not even sure now if the S5 Avant is coming to the US, which is the part I was most looking forward to with B10.",Audi

"The Tesla is the slowest EV on that list.  Teslas aren't really that fast, that bragging point is gone.
People used to brag about Teslas being faster down a drag strip but that point is gone.  I was only referring to that brand, not EVs in general.

The build quality comment has nothing to do with them being EVs, it's in reference to all of the quality problems with Teslas  that I see owners talk about.  Changing the engine in a car isn't going to undo current build quality of the cars, an Audi EV is still an Audi and has that build quality.

Sorry if I wasn't clear, I'm pro-EV in general just against the shit quality of Tesla.  The refusal to update existing power supply systems have nothing to do with EVs.  There are states that can't keep up with basic power usage as is, who's at fault for that?

""EVs will cause more carbon emissions because of all the coal that's burnt to produce the extra power!""

""Updating our 100 year old power generation and distribution is bad!  We want to stay in the past!""

">How long does it take to charge on a 150 kW charger (let‚Äôs say going from like 20‚Äì>100%)?

I don't know the numbers, but it's always fastest to charge from 20->80%, not 100%, and just do one extra stop or something. Because every car limits the charging speed from 80->100%. 

Charging to 100% is usually fine when charging over night, so you can get those extra miles the next day, but waiting at a charger to go from 80->100 will take a looong time.

Again, don't know the numbers for the Etron, but usually it's like 30 or 40 min from 20% to 80%, and then another 40 minutes from 80% to 100%.",Audi

No direct experience with an S4, but I remember my first impression of my S4 on some backroads - it pushed like a pig. Might take a bit of suspension work to get it more neutral.

B58 is a better engine and this probably drives better than a rs5 and has higher tuning potential but the rs5 has much better styling and is easier to drive fast,Audi
What were you going for here?,Audi
This seems like something a certified mechanic at a dealership should know... lol,Audi
Audi salesman here. I drive a 2007 RS4. It almost certainly looks lowered from that angle. Unfortunately the dynamic ride control hydraulic lines are no longer being made. So once the stock suspension goes it's very difficult to repair. I had to get new coilovers for my car about 3 months ago for that very reason.,Audi

"What if you have kids and a dog? What if you have kids and have a lot of luggage for camping trips etc? The back seat area of these cars is not big at all. 

With my dog in the back, and two passengers in the back seats there is virtually no room at all except for whatever is left with the dog. I‚Äôm having to consider a roof box simply because the rear passenger area in the 6 models is actually very, very small. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt think *everyone* needs a wagon. You are right, having kids doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that you need something the size of an RV just to run to the store with them, but if you‚Äôve got infants in car seats, you aren‚Äôt going to have room for much else in the back with them, and the trunk of a sport back is what, less than half the size of the rear area of a wagon? 

I can think of a dozen other legitimate reasons for wanting a wagon, but I can also think of as many for wanting a sport back, a hatchback, and a convertible ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è to each their own. 

I have moments where I wish I could have a saloon but my lifestyle just doesn‚Äôt allow it right now, at least not as a daily. Visibility in my car *sucks* and is so much neuter in pretty much everything else I‚Äôve sat in.",Audi

As someone who was a Euro mechanic for a while and has owned Audi and VW since I started driving in 2012, this would never be on my radar even having some expendable income - it‚Äôs asking for headaches. You are looking at a tremendous mistake buying luxury on a budget, I tell all my friends and family unless you‚Äôre a superb mechanic with some extra income, don‚Äôt buy an Audi on a budget especially not one of the 5, 6, 7, 8 cars but still not even an A3/4.

">Remember when EVs were the fastest cars going down a drag strip?  Now they can't keep up with ICE cars.

The top eight fastest quarter mile times by stock cars:

>Pininfarina Battista ‚Äì 8.55s (EV)

>RIMAC Nevera ‚Äì 8.58s (EV)

>Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170 ‚Äì 8.91s (ICE)

>Lucid Air Sapphire ‚Äì 9.20s (EV)

>Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ ‚Äì 9.4s (ICE)

>McLaren 765LT ‚Äì 9.37s (ICE)

>Tesla Model S Plaid ‚Äì 9.50s (EV)

>Ferrari SF90 Stradale ‚Äì 9.50s (hybrid eV)

Half of those are EVs, including the top 2. One is a hybrid. The EVs are also often WAY cheeper than the cars they are beating. Hell, the Lucid and Tesla aren't even sports cars. 

But go off on how EVs ""were"" the fastest cars down a drag strip and how they ""can't keep up with ICE cars"" lol. 

You're more than allowed to have a preference and own what you prefer, but the numbers are easy to prove and thus not worth lying about.

Also, the build quality thing is largely a Tesla complaint more than a EV complaint. Even our own beloved Audi makes EVs. You going to say they have shit build quality too? How about Porsche?",Audi

Definitely get AAA because you will be on a flat bed tow truck often.  A new starter is $1500 and the front bumper has to come out for more repairs than you‚Äôd like,Audi
"good luck! but its very know problem for those, most sell before 200k, this engine also on skoda octavia, superb and vw passat.",Audi
"Honestly, it seems they have the least problems out of the cars we have. I‚Äôd personally go for a 19-20 T6 (4Cyl supercharged, turboed, AWD) R Design with the Polestar Tune upgrade. Great power, very comfy. 

You‚Äôll get a CEL for an evap pipe, your flame box, and maybe injectors before 100k miles. Almost guaranteed. But if those have been fixed, it‚Äôs a pretty solid car. And none of those will cause your car to run like shit or break down either. We have a supercharger leak causing a ‚ÄúSystem too lean‚Äù CEL on a ton of XC90s, but never the S60s. Just like most new cars it‚Äôll burn oil, BUT, if you do oil changes every 5k instead of 10k, like I do on my Audi, and use 5W-30 instead of the water like 0W-20, it‚Äôs a non issue. 

Other than the listed stuff, you‚Äôre mainly looking at tires and brakes. If you really drive the piss outta it, might need an alternator by 120k miles, maybe a supercharger if you‚Äôre unlucky (again haven‚Äôt seen that on a S60 though).

Edit: I want to add, I specifically said T6 version of the cars. Our newest ones, mild hybrid B5 and B6, are a fucking headache. We have issues where your TCAM won‚Äôt shut off, causing it to kill your 12V, 48V, and TCAM battery, car needs towed, charged, and software installed. They dropped the ball on these cars, can‚Äôt lie. But those T5 and T6, are fantastic.",Audi

The Miltek exhausts that I've seen videos of on S5s have made a bit of a raspy sound at mid-revs that I really don't like and I also asked my tuner about exhausts when the car was on the rolling road dyno and he said that the factory fitted exhaust is so good that it doesn't restrict air flow at all (apart from the cats) even when tuned to stage 2+ with dual pulley upgrades and I like the deep sound of the standard exhaust so I'm not going to change it. I'm thinking of fitting test pipes to replace the cats though for a bit more power at some point.",Audi

Audi will run you 2-3k/year in maintenance/repairs out of warranty, but if you drive for a few years, you can't go back to a Toyota.

If you want to keep it long, get the S-Line Technik trim. It has the nicest interior and all the fun tech stuff. And if you get it from the Audi Dealership, get one that is CPO for about 1 year, you get lower interest rate and 1 year of factory warranty.

"Speaking from a position as a BMW fanboy for most of my life....the E60 is almost entirely unreliable, almost every single subsystem in those cars has had large issues.  Engine might be slightly better with one of the M54 or N52 engine platforms but even then the model is long in the tooth.

W211 chassis holds up better in the long term and the sport package on the MB looks sharp, but hardly a comparison to the driving feel of a BMW.  But, reliability being a primary this might be the best path.

The Audi C6, definitely the heaviest of the 3, with the least HP base, and steer as far away from that CVT as possible.  Looks are simple and clean and I'll have to allow someone else to chime in on reliability as I only drove one for a long road trip across the country.  I experienced no issues at all, but  mpg were not stellar.",Audi

If the m4 is 6MT get it. If it's auto get the rs5. Went from a 440i gc mppsk to an b9 a4 6MT less punchy even tuned but way better on gas's handling and feel. 440i was badass only due to mppsk package.,Audi

Most of the brands you interact with on a day to day basis are subsidiaries.  That doesn‚Äôt mean you go around saying the products are made by the parent company.  You say they‚Äôre made by the brand (even if they‚Äôre made by 3rd party suppliers who make everything for all parent companies),Audi

"I‚Äôll simplify it for you. If you are looking for a year round car that can get through anything including bad weather/snow all while being comfortable, fast, and great to look at then buy the Audi.

"The 2009 - 2012 Audi A4/A5 models are referred to as B8 Models and feature the Gen 2 V1 EA888 2.0T. This engine is well known to be a flawed engine from the factory.

In particular the timing chain tensioner is known to be faulty and cause timing failures prematurely leading to expensive engine rebuilds. Additionally the camshaft bridge/bracket features an oil filter screen that tends to pop out and cause timing issue. Finally these engines are also known to have oil consumption issues. 

These are truly beautiful cars, I particularly love the aesthetics of the B8 Audis, however the 2.0T in them is an expensive and problem prone engine. 

If a mechanic did the timing service with the upgraded OEM parts including tensioner and camshaft bracket, and there were no historical signs of excessive oil consumption the car would still be on the more expensive end of maintenance at this stage in its life.

In particular, off the top of my head, right now is about when the PCV typically fails, if this is not caught early it can lead to the rear main seal failing. 

I would not get invested in a 14 year old car normally, but in this case I would heavily suggest you avoid it.",Audi

"On various RS6 groups (Facebook, etc). The '21 cars hitting 40k are getting their second one as there isn't a modified part yet. Mine went at just under 19k.

I get it - prototyping a new 48v generator and testing to 100k plus miles on an RS6/7 and putting it into production is slow. It's probably a low priority on Audi's list, but it's not fun for owners.

My Audi dealer was great - they got a part in under 48 hours.

Where are we at on ‚Äúhubcaps‚Äù vs ‚Äúwheel covers‚Äù?,Audi
"The M4 is RWD and it‚Äôs lighter. It‚Äôs going to depreciate less and it‚Äôs more fun to drive. The interior is classic BMW with a focus on driving and functionality.  The M4 is wild. It will easily spin the rear tires and rotate, which is desirable for some drivers and undesirable for the uninitiated. It‚Äôs the more raw and unhinged car. It‚Äôs one of the reasons you still see M4‚Äôs at the track and rarely and RS5‚Äôs. 

The RS5 tends to push, and the dynamics are more subdued.  Interior is slightly nicer with a focus on tech and luxury. It‚Äôs heavier and easier to drive. 

I‚Äôd pick the M4, but I‚Äôve had two F80 M3‚Äôs already so while some might call that being biased, I chose them because I found them to be the better vehicles for me at the time.",Audi

Well you could Cook a Pizza in the Garage when the fan went off.
So since I figured out Audis Game plan I ordered a S7
From the Same Dealer 10 months later it came in.
I ordered the S7 with the exact same items as my RS6
Only difference is the engine is a 6 Cylinder.
Remember from A6 to A7 Audi are 195 inches long so the space inside is the same.
So the difference is the Engine so my RS6 was 135k
My S7 was $103K that‚Äôs 32k Difference .

"I'm going to assume your motor has stock internals, if that's correct, get a hybrid IS38 turbo and call it a day. Don't go actual big turbo unless it's: 
1) Not your daily driver
2) You aren't relying on this car in any way
3) You are ok with blowing the motor or
4) Are planning on taking the motor out and putting forged rods in it.

I ran through the same dilemma with my A3 which has the previous generation EA888 motor in it and I'm grateful I went stock frame hybrid turbo (K04 for that generation) over a big custom turbo. It's going to be cheaper to do, more reliable and much more daily drivable. Also if you've never run water WM in a car before, I'd recommend going the route of not being totally dependant on it for the car to run right.

One of my first cars had water meth and ran 30+ psi, it was a rowdy car but it sucked through a tank of meth in like 10 good pulls and then my fun was over until I could find more meth which isn't always the easiest to find. When I lived in Mass there was a chemical wholesale place near me that sold 5 gal and 50 gal drums of pure methanol, I'd HIGHLY recommend going that route over some premix expensive bs.",Audi

Having a fresh pad and rotor will always have the best contact.  I'd agree that it's the smartest thing to do as long as you don't factor in budget.  Realistically you'd be fine swapping the pads without the rotors.... probably.  I haven't had to change my brakes yet, but based on the amount of dust they produce I can imagine the pads will go long before the rotors would need to be replaced (or resurfaced on many cars).",Audi

You might want to ask if there is a software update for the radio, that can fix issues like what you have, it could also be an issue with the radio hardware itself, but I would try an update first (if possible).

Soundwise I actually prefer the 2.9 of the RS5 over the S55 in the M4, but thats down to personal preference. Same goes for looks. The F82 is a beauty and the last good looking M4 out there, since the G8x looks like ass. The B9 looks amazing as well.

Obviously this is the Audi sub, so most will tell you straight up ""go for the Audi"", if you posted this in the BMW sub, everybody will tell you ""M4, only RWD cars are real cars"". 

In the end in my eyes it comes down to what you need the car for. Daily, go for the RS5. Better tech, better interior quality, Quattro, etc.
As a weekend car, M4, maily because of RWD, so its more fun to drive. Apart from that I can actually not think about a single point for the M4. Thats not because I dont like it, but the F82/F32 overall is just a bit older than the B9 generation.",Audi

"Its stupid, but I think even on the RS3, its an option.",Audi
That doesn‚Äôt change my opinion that it‚Äôs ugly,Audi
"The RS5‚Äôs C&D tested 0.95 lateral g is lower than the M4‚Äôs 1.0g. 

The RS5 weighs 400-600lbs more than the M4 and is nose heavy. The M4 is nearly 50/50 balanced as the engine is farther back behind the front wheels. 

Corner entry will be faster in the M4 where the Audi has to enter slower due to the engine being so far over the front wheels and overall weight.  The M4 will be faster mid corner as well, but will have to be on the throttle later than the Audi, which can start throttling sooner due to the AWD. So while the RS5 has an advantage on corner exit, but it is overall disadvantaged in the corners despite being AWD. Hence lap times are generally faster with the M4. 

For the everyday driver, this isn‚Äôt important, as the RS5 will be easier to manage. For the enthusiast and high performance driver who might compete in autocross or track days, or enjoys the more rotation the M4 is the more popular choice of the two.",Audi

Lets say the m4 has 8/10 performance and 6/10 comfort.

RS5 would score just a lil more points overal if you compared them from every aspect. Getting the RS5 would give you a happier user experience if you are gonna own it for a few years. Going on trackdays, using it as a daily, rolling with the other vehicles on the highway and if you ever need it, that paint and those looks will get alot more chicks in the passenger seat.

  
Edit: Forgot to note that the RS5 is a newer car. That M4 is a car that came out in 2014 while the RS5 is a car that came out in 2017 and audi is still selling that car's facelifted version unlike bmw who has released a newer version of it.",Audi

"Nothing wrong with looking ""outdated"" as long as the performance is still there

Just look at the 911. Look at how many minor changes they made over the years. You don't go and massively change something that works

The same could be said for shoes. The Samba and Superstars are iconic shoes for Adidas for a reason. Minor enhancements have been made for fit, comfort and durability but overall it still looks like a Samba and Superstar

I'm not saying change is bad, but when you've perfected a certain look for a certain product, it just comes down to making minor enhancements that further cement the product as being the ""best"". It also gives the manufacturer time to recoup their investments in R&D

The longer they can keep a certain design, the longer they can continue generating ROI as long as they make minor enhancements where it's most important

For a car, it's comfort, engine & transmission performance, fuel efficiency, interior tech features. Stuff like that

Too much change can be a bad thing. One need not like at BMW to see how polarizing that grille is. Looks like buckteeth to me. They made an amazing 2021 M2 look awful. 2021 was literally peak for BMW and it all went down the toilet

You could also make the case about physical buttons and knobs. I love that my Q5 and Rogue still have physical buttons and knobs for HVAC and media

"The laser lights are, I think, different than active/standard matrix LED headlights. The laser lights are a sort of 'super high beam' that extends the visible area out further in front of the car.

From the Audi MediaCenter:

Audi laser light

Available for selected top models, Audi laser light doubles the range of the high beam. A small laser module in each headlight generates a light cone that extends several hundred meters as a spotlight. The monochromatic and coherent blue laser beam has a wavelength of 450 nanometers. A phosphor converter transforms it into white light suitable for roadway use with a color temperature of 5,500 Kelvin ‚Äì ideal conditions for the human eye: Drivers enjoy greater contrast and tire less quickly. The laser spot, which is active at speeds of 70 km/h (43.5 mph) and above, also offers significant visibility and safety advantages. The laser spot dims automatically if the camera mounted on the windshield detects other cars within its range.

Worth noting that they cannot be manually turned on - you must have auto high beams enabled, with no oncoming traffic or ambient light in the vicinity.

UPDATE: I see that Audi is working on Matrix Laser headlights, but I think they are still in development:

"While I can't speak to the N55, this car is easily one of the most enjoyable cars I've driven. So here are all of the reasons why I went S55. The US spec M2C does not have the shitty sounding exhaust. The M4 improvements that were dropped in really excited me; it's actually slightly comical seeing parts that are casted with M4 text on them. Those upgrades include the 6 piston front brakes which provides some serious stopping power for the relatively light weight car. The S55 puts a shit eating grin on my face every time I start it up. The engine has a pretty early starting power band right around 2k rpm and it feels really easy to get going with the short 1st gear. 10/10 would recommend and would even go M2CS if cost was not an issue",Audi

"Engine braking in an automatic is different than engine braking in a manual transmission. If you say ""Engine Braking"" everyone is going to assume you have a manual transmission.

Im not entirely sure how you would engine brake in an automatic transmission unless you have the transmission in semi auto mode and you are manually downshifting the transmission to take advantage of the engine braking. I would recommend you abandon purposefully attempting such engine braking. The car is designed to be used, its designed to be manually shifted, but I feel like you might be putting extra strain on the transmission when you should just be using your braking system.",Audi

"Gotta jump in the wayback machine for my Audi origins story. It's pretty vanilla.

It was 1998 or 1999, I lived in Anchorage, and all I knew about Audi was that there were some allegations of unintended acceleration from the 70's or 80's (60 Minutes contributed to the hysteria). 

Anyway, my neighbor brought home a new A6. It was a beautiful car, practical for Anchorage weather, and we were looking to replace my wife's VW Passat. Boom! we bought a silver 2.7TT A6. At the time, that was a rocket ship of a sedan, and our first ""lux"" brand. Up until then I was a Mustang GT 5.0 guy (not practical in Anchorage winters with a kid).",Audi

"I‚Äôve owned both had a 2018 RS5 and switch over the a 2018 M3. If I were to pick, it‚Äôs going to be RS5. The F8X is a lot more fun platform the mod community has more option and is cheaper. My F80 ended up making 700 hp to the wheel with just E85, custom tune, downpipe, stage 2+ turbo and meth. But BMW interior quality is poop compared to the RS5. The ride in the RS5 is more comfortable. I felt like I was in a rocketship in the RS5 but the M3 felt like a cheap sedan. Quattro AWD makes the RS5 so planted and stable. The M3 will slide a little which was fun. The F80 felt like a car that would cost 20k less despite it being the around the same price new. 

TLDR: RS5 has superior build quality and Quattro makes it so stable and easy to drive and control at high speeds. 

M3 is more fun and the community and mods are better. It‚Äôs very easy to push out huge power on the F8X. 

I would pick all over again RS5 bc it was overall the better car for me.",Audi

But yet they are on the list. Above NUMEROUS ICE cars. The 100k tesla is faster in the quarter mile than several million dollar hypercars that didn't even make that list. That's impressive for a 4 door sedan. 

>The build quality comment has nothing to do with them being EVs, it's in reference to all of the quality problems with Teslas

You didn't say tesla a single time. I was inferring you meant tesla based on your comment, but your comment was about EVs as it reads/was written. Sorry if I came off as hostile, the clarification needed made. 

>Sorry if I wasn't clear, I'm pro-EV in general just against the shit quality of Tesla.

We can agree there. I dislike Tesla. The numbers don't lie, however. Credit where it's due, the thing is fast. 

Also, nuclear power as well as green power is already super safe and clean, its just lobbied against by coal and oil industries. But that's well outside the scope of this discussion on cars.

"I used to own an 06 A8. The door pocket was broken like that on mine. I tried to fix it, but it was so difficult to get out, I just dealt with it, despite how annoying it was. The part on the dash, you can get those on ebay for pretty cheap. It just slips in. I believe it's a business card holder. Once you get the trim piece and install it you'll likely never open it again. You just push it in and it pops out.
The thing under the armrests is the connection for the Audi cell phone. You don't even need to worry about this. The screen likely has a broken gear. You'll have to disassemble the front of the dash to get to it. You might be able to find the gear on ebay, if not the entire display assembly.
As for the folks saying you made a bad decision buying this thing, well they're not wrong, but if the car is in decent enough shape, you're not going to have a lot of problems. I drove mine from 75k to about 198k til I sold it while looking for a newer A8. All I had done  While I had it was timing chain, water pump, and one air strut. Other than that, just normal servicing. The timing chain was an expensive job. So with it being at 188k,that could be an upcoming service you'll have to ""look forward to""",Audi

"First and foremost, it's really about what you want out of the car. Luxury commuter with the ability for some spirited driving or something more closely aligned with a track car that you can deal with driving around town?

I'm leaning towards the BMW in general as an owner of multiple BMW and Audi generations, though I can really only speak generally as I've driven neither an RS5 or M4. I would lean to the BMW for the soul and to the Audi for the build quality and commutability. 

There is a rawness about an M car that S/RS models just don't scratch for me. When comparing my F87 to the various S models I've owned and the RS models I've driven, the M will allow you get into trouble and give you freedom to push the car to the brink of what it's fully capable of doing.This creates a unique feeling of respect for the M car every time I jump in it; I can roast the tires in Sport+ MDM mode or go into a corner hot and if I do things right, the car will get me through it. The car feels alive from the moment you cold start it until the moment you park it again.

Audi has done a great job with creating a resemblance of control while driving the vehicle from systems like their AWD; I feel infinitely safer accelerating in any condition with an Audi. Need to climb a hill with a 15-25 degree incline in the snow with summer tires on? Audi's got you. Have to pass someone and it's raining? The drive train technology in the Audi does it effortlessly. That said, you aren't really in control of the vehicle, the drive systems are.

Audi's control on the roads is amazing but it is also shitty under the hood. Want to run a tune or some performance mods? Risk getting TD1 flagged and voided on warranty by most dealerships. BMW has traditionally been more lenient on the enthusiast/modding community at least where I'm at.

Where I have a tough time with the BMW is build quality. I have two annoying defects on a 2020 car with ~11k miles on it that I can't really fix as they are just flawed in their design and will likely fail in the same way if replaced. Both issues are cosmetic and I didn't experience that in the B8, 8.5, and 9 platforms.

Any ways, thanks for reading my TED talk and good luck on your decision!",Audi

I think the RS6 is more spotable as it's a wagon and a totally different shape to the A6 and S6 rather than just the wide body.

I also find the it doesn't draw attention from non-car people as much as 'traditionally' sportier looking cars like the RS7. Enthusiasts are excited, but the SUV crowd just think 'poor guy couldn't afford an SUV and got a wagon' and the eco crowd only know wagons from Subaru so it doesn't attract their ire.

Other benefits are my kid can spot me easily in the school pickup line unlike the other kids who can't tell which white Tesla to go to (socal).

You also get to be in 'wagon club' with other brands such as Mercedes and BMW whose wagon drivers are always delighted to see you. We also don't fight as we all know our standing - the Mercedes wagon sounds better, the Audi wagon looks better, etc.

"I'm extremely familiar with lease structures. A lease by it's nature has the individual pay down an established percentage of depreciation based on miles driven and yrs leased along side a sometimes called rent charge or interest or money factor. 

Therefore you go into the car knowing what your depreciation is going to be and how much it's going to cost you. That's a big difference from Financing the car and eating any extra depreciation from current lease offers. I suppose in the last 3 yrs many have had better luck with financing and selling but you could always do that with a lease also. 

This is why many people lease expensive luxury cars that depreciate generally like a rock vs buying them. BMW is well known for having generous lease residuals vs real world market. This is why CPOs are also more expensive generally as they have value added warranty but also helps offset the fact that the leaser paid less than the depreciation that would typically occur if they tried to trade in a 3 yr old financed car.",Audi

"Radio Problem: 
There is a cogwheel inside that is broken so it does not fold out. you need to remove the bar under it with all the buttons then its 2 screws to remove the display. this cogwheel you can buy of ebay for cheap as this is a common problem. 

‚ÄûButton‚Äú missing: 
The button that is missing you can replace, i have one laying around but im fron germany so shipping probably will be to expensive and finding a local one maybe makes more sense. when you press it a drawer comes out to put cards and coins in. 

center console: 
there should be a audi branded bluetooth phone. 

door pocket: 
as far as i know its not fixable. i have put some electrical tape on it that holds it in place and i can still open and close it. thats also a common problem.

(used) parts are for the most part very cheap and normal service parts are also cheap just do not bring it to a audi dealer. This car can be kept on the road cheaper than a new VW golf if you fix it by yourself. Get yourself VCDS you will need it.

The oldest gallardos are 20 years old now and they haven‚Äôt really gone up in value. I don‚Äôt see the R8 going up in value anytime soon. It will one day but not in the near future. On average it takes 20 years for the supply to drop way below the actual demand.",Audi
"Yes, it's the same. It's a different method to achieve the same thing. It's plenty safe",Audi
That's too old. The rule of thumb is to not get a German car that is out of warranty unless you know to work on it yourself,Audi
"I cross-shopped between the W204 C-class and the B8.5 A4, and when I test drove the C class it felt cheap and rode nothing like the old W126 S-class we had growing up, so after a quick test drive around the block I picked the A4.",Audi
"I‚Äôm legitimately considering going back as the sales manager and salesman profusely apologized for his actions. But now he planted a seed in my head that this Audi is going to have electrical issues, which is not what I want for my daily.",Audi
"I'm sorry, while the Audi is probably my favorite car to own, I can't deny that the Alfa Romeo 147 GTA I had 12 years ago was my favorite car to drive of the 9 different makes I've had.",Audi

Would you happen to know if it's uv/ heat rejection or just tint?,Audi

"> was fully *paid* for by

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

"It only really affects the DSG transmissions, which the a4 & a5 don‚Äôt usually have. But it was an option, called s-tronic. Just don‚Äôt get an s-tronic and you‚Äôre fine. The s-tronic is more fun, shifts way faster, so it may be worth the trade off in reliability tho

My 2014 a5 with the tiptronic (auto that is not the s-tronic) transmission, which is basically the same car, has gone 150k miles and still no big problems.. 

There is also the manual transmission and the CVT multitronic. Definitely don‚Äôt get the multitronic because old cvts are junk in any car.

The manual is probably the most reliable if you really wanna go reliable.",Audi

The best way of telling if there‚Äôs a pressure loss is when you drive it you‚Äôll get a noise a bit like if you had a golf ball rolling round in the boot (trunk).

We all have different lives and lifestyles, but I always lean towards the practical choice just in case cause you never know. I would rather have it when I need it, than not have it when I do. 

Maybe test drive them both for a few days and see what fits you best?",Audi
"Yeah them saying it might just go away is absurd. Pretty sure there's nothing in the manual that says ""your instrument cluster may stop working at random for an indeterminate amount of time, maybe it will get better on its own idk haha"". If it's broken and there are faults clearly displayed there should be no question that there's something to troubleshoot. I misunderstood and thought it happened once and it's been behaving since, which would be difficult to troubleshoot and they typically won't just load the parts cannon and start replacing parts willy nilly unless they are confident something has failed.",Audi

"I had a car with Ultra and it was fine.    Unless you are hooning it on a track or in dirt, you won't notice the difference in real life.     Ultra will run FWD when cruising along unless power is needed for the rear, so it's really just as fuel efficient as a FWD car.     But if you give it enough beans or lose grip in wet or snow or hard cornering, it will send power to the rear almost instantly and so seamlessly you won't know besides maintaining traction.   And it can send most of the power to the rear when needed.    It's not as nice as  having my S-Sport diff, but neither is Torsen without the rear diff.",Audi

It's probably because the dealer don't have any information on where the car is either. It was the same when I order my audi.,Audi

"The are a bunch of differences, think of it as the same difference between a BMW M4 or M440i if you‚Äôre a BMW guy or along those lines. One is a cheaper alternative with less performance. Everything including engine, suspension etc is different even though the cars look the same.",Audi

"Rs5 is a performance car while the m340i is just the 340i with m looks and a lil bit of performance upgrades. You cant really compare these two. If you got the budget and in the end you wont be sad for spending more/less, get the RS5. It is a better car if you ask me. But if you need the practicality get the 3 series as it is a sedan. S5 vs M340i would be a better comparison instead of RS5. But there shouldnt be a %35 difference if you are comparing two cars that are MEANT to be compared.

If you have to get one of them this second, get the RS5.

"I agree.  The regular grill looks is a nice mixture of black and chrome.  While I don't dislike the black optics trim, I wish it was different in a number of ways:

* They should have left the rings chrome, or better yet, maybe made them sort of greyish titanium color.

* The side mirror top should have remained silver.

* And while I am OK with the wheel design, I am not OK at all with them being 20"" with elastic band tires on them.  I drive in the real world, not on ideal roads.

I think it‚Äôs the perfect mix of luxury and sport for the price. If it‚Äôs not the daily and you‚Äôre looking for a sick, fun driving sports car, go for the M4. Have you driven both of them?

I used to have one of these, before I dumped it for a 2018 with a factory extended warranty.

1. Pop a CD in the CD player, does it turn on (play the CD) at all when you press the volume knob or does it make some noises but music plays. 1 of 3 things cause this. a. Someone spilled liquid in the MMI panel, it's in an idiotic place, and it's not water proof, if it doesn't respond the system shuts down. b. one of the modules is disconnected, this was one of the premier cars of the MOST ring, buy an optic jumper and figure out which module is disconnected or broken, they break easily on these (might be the XM Radio module, no you can't get it to work) or someone installed a Dennsion and didn't reconnect the ring when pulling it out. c. Check the fuses

1a. Get a VCDS and get familiar as fuck with it, if its the MMI panel that $1000 for the part, aftermarket didn't exist when I had mine. Oh and I forgot, sometimes the mechanism for the screen breaks and it wont pop up, it never happened in mine, but its probably $500-$1500 depending if you find an Audi indy or the dealer.

&#x200B;

2. It's not a button, it's a card holder, the front of it breaks off cause its 2000s era VW plastic and its paper thin. You have to work at it while pushing in and it will probably eventually come out.

3. You could option the car with a shitty flip phone that would connect through that and you got all your calls and contacts that way. On some Mercs you could plop a bluetooth module, I have no idea on the Audi, I put in a Dennsion.

4. The bottom part sits on like a groove, try and lift it up while pushing it back onto that groove, or just push it back and give it a kick and it might pop back.

5. Literally everything, check the Air Suspension, the back springs were starting to fail on mine at 180k miles, the dealer quoted $5000 to replace them, an indy quoted $2000 at least. The factory air springs have adaptive dampers in them making them more expensive then Arnott aftermarket ones. You should dump it while you can for a newer A6 or A4, they will have literally the same tech. But if you're set on it, then get familiar with Audis",Audi

"The function of the lid is not rocket science. the lid sits in a recess in the fender, and just inside that recess on the left at about 270 degrees angle is a hole from where a plastic pin sticks out.

It is VERY easily done. The security aspect of the pin is nil so you can just break it and forget about it. If somebody wants to steal your gas they wont care if the lid is locked or not.",Audi

That car has aged so well tbh. It really has held up even if the interior tells a different story. I love the TT. Sad that it's discontinued,Audi
Right I just checked online so the new A4 Is going all electric (yuk) and the A5 is coming out in just two variants the sports back and the avant (no 2 door or cab) This is for the new 2025 models btw and I guess worldwide not just the UK.,Audi

"I drive an 07 a8L, still learning things about it everyday 

The black bock inside was for those first iteration of mobile ohones. Essentially a charging dock for those bricks of phones. The button on the right side under the vent is actually supposed to be a coin and card holder(atleast in my car). I‚Äôm not sure what the issue could be with the radio, however my best guess is the electrical went out, and you would have to open up the entire console or open up the glovebox to reach that wiring to fix. There‚Äôs also kits online to install CarPlay using that OEM screen in the middle, I‚Äôm planning on doing that soon but today I‚Äôm going out to get a new custom exhaust for it. The CarPlay solution I was looking at was called Mr. 12 Volt, seemed very nice. Another issue with your radio not working is that everything in this car is reliant on the radio; air suspensions, clocks, the original GPS, or even swapping to an aux using the MDI (which should be located in glove box next to or replacing the CD drive). Goodluck with it, you can send me if you need more help or interested in what mine is looking like!

"I hope you can get it really cheap at least. For most people a car like this is EOL and will have no real resale value. Here in EU once your car goes 250.000KM+ it's basically export only.

Things will start to fail at some point and sinking money into a car that's realistically not worth much will be quite annoying and you are stuck with it. Of course you can show it off to your neighbours though. (Eastern EU style)

Imo if your own car reaches these KM it's fine of course, but I would never buy a car with 200.000KM on it.",Audi
Is that what you have on your S5? And did you do the back window or the windshield?,Audi

"I concour.... electric cars are not the future all these companies are banging all there money into them. Private buyers are switching away from them already 23% down only lease cars still growing resale values will plummet soon. My bestie is service manager for vw and he's just had a recall on 3000 golf's id3 to fix battery issues....at 15 grand a pop to vw. They have a 1 year old used id4 on the forecourt at half its original cost aswell.
.
He was saying the batteries have a shelf life of 10 years and will be only 50% efficient even then

Amd 10-15 k Min for new batteries and fitting ....it doesn't take a brain surgeon to work out where its all going ...

Down the toilet hopefully .... he took me out in a demo id3 the other day and without doubt and by a long way it worse the worst short drive I had ever had in a car.... lifeless, no soul, no character and just depressing. I can't imagine how dreary these peoples eveeyday lives are who buy and drive these things. I actually told him to stop and I walked the  last mile back to save my soul..... I honestly did lol",Audi

"It's decent enough, a bit rough especially if you ask it to give it full beans but serviceable.

I had a piggyback tune on mine that made it a bit less hesitant, could even wheelspin from a standstill, can definitely recommend getting one, I had one produced by DTE Systems from Germany, bought from a UK reseller.",Audi
"Oil does expand by a known amount as it heats up and 100ish mph for any real period of time probably pushed oil temps into the 130s or 140s C as a guess.

Roughly a 4% increase in volume for every 100*F (I know I'm mixing units and it's bad).",Audi

Anyway my mom has a 2011 a5 and it cost her so much in repairs so something like this would likely be more expensive",Audi
"To my knowledge Audis dont have remote start, at least not until recently.

How many keys did you get with the car? If you have only one key I wonder if the other key is hidden in the car somewhere to disable the immobilizer for an aftermarket remote start system. I think its possible for advanced remote start systems to avoid using a sacrificial key for the immobilizer but I think its rare.",Audi
"This will be my second audi, absolutely love this vehicle. Bought at 45000km. In great shape. 
Few questions - I was not fully aware of air suspension option, what would be the best way to have this sitting lower, while still maintaining current performance?
Any recommendations for after market exhaust? They are hidden behind the bumper on this model. 
Is there any major maintenance I should be planning for before 100000km other than regular service?",Audi

"Glad that you said T6, now I feel like I've made a really good choice with the 2019 model :) the fuel mileage was good like 10 years ago but it's a blast to drive. That turbo and supercharger work so great together ü•∞
You can drive it slow, drive it fast doesn't matter and the massage seats you've mentioned before are so great... 
We don't have any cameras or keyless go, but I guess the less help you get the more you still drive by yourself. I think in the us cameras are mandatory for some time so probably every new t6 has a camera installed, but the crazy thing is the self parking feature works only with the parking sensors and not with the cameras. That blew my mind when I fist saw it, no cameras but still parks by itself.
Btw what's your favorite color?",Audi
"Missed your other question, the car is not cpo and it is an Audi warranty. The sales manager called me and offered to throw in the 2 year warranty for free. I do really like the car, so I‚Äôm considering going back. The guy told me that Southern California is the worst place to own a car, ‚Äúput your phone in the sun for 45 minutes, now think what will happen to the car‚Äôs electronics, I guarantee that if you buy this car without the warranty, you will be back in here in 6 months with electrical issues and I will be laughing at you‚Äù",Audi
"I owned a 06 for like 5 years and dumped a good bit of money to keep it running.  

Those radios do break and they are quite expensive to fix. 

One thing I would look out for is to make sure you have a new fresh battery.  That car DOES NOT like after market batteries  they have to be the OEM ones.  This could fix your radio  actually, when I tried to cheap out and use an aftermarket one radio wouldn't turn on either. Worth a shot.

Good luck I do miss my car,  sad I had to sell it but it was a big money pit.",Audi

I have a white S7 and was looking at a similar spec Black one. At first I thought black but then I saw swirl marks (used) so went with white. Easier to keep clean and also looks really sick at night. I like the white even better as time goes on.,Audi
Honestly the phone box was more annoying than useful. Just took up space I could have used for storage. If I‚Äôm using car play I‚Äôm plugged in anyway and on cars with wireless CarPlay you can‚Äôt use it and charge at the same time because the phone overheats. So wireless charging is pretty useless.,Audi
