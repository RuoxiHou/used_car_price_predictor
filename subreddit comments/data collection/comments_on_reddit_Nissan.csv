"I would definitely check out [RockAuto.com](https://RockAuto.com).  They offer really good warranty, just make sure you have your mechanic fill out the warranty registration card.

I would suggest replacing the o2 sensors as well.  Its very easy to do when replacing the cat. Nissan did not put them in easily accessible locations, especially the upstream sensor.  They also sometimes break when you remove them.",Nissan

Idk about Sentra but my 2013 Altima has 135K and no issues yet (Knock on wood) but I keep up on fluid changes every 30K. I don‚Äôt know it appears to be worse in some models compared to others though. Like cheaper models like the Sentra and Versa seem to have more issues.,Nissan
Appreciate the fast responses,Nissan
I‚Äôve tried that no avail,Nissan
I can't say anything about 2016 but we have 2 2012 Sentra's and they are well over 100k and running perfectly fine with no issues at all. We maintained them though.,Nissan

"I really appreciate everyone giving me all the feedback. We are just so darn disappointed with our Honda Civic sport. It's been in the service department 3 times for the same darn issue and that's exactly why we finally bought a new car. Second one in 33 years of marriage.

Thankfully I‚Äôve never had CVT issues, and I‚Äôm on top of my maintenance, but that‚Äôs not to say shit still doesn‚Äôt happen or fail. I‚Äôve seen it myself working at dealers.

"Interesting, thank you for the insight I'll relay that. I'm a Ford tech so I'm here to figure out what might be different in Nissans compared to what I'm used to.

 Correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't disconnecting the battery and connecting the harness leads for 30 seconds drain the capacitors reset the learned values? Is that TSB different from the 2013-2015 Sentra P0101 TSB? (it was top result when I googled it)",Nissan

I recently was in an accident with my 23 sentra. I was on the receiving end of a Honda odyssey which is essentially a mini van. Car was totaled. I made it out with no harm. I purchased a 24 shortly after. My whole family owns nissans of different models. We think the reliability comes from the fact they rarely have a recall.,Nissan
"Yeah, I ended up doing a full makeover of my Sentra speakers. I got a 22 SR, and it was so annoying having to add a converter just to get decent speakers in the car cause of the shitty underpowered factory head unit.

the CVT transmissions were allegedly improved in 2020 so if you want a Sentra that‚Äôs probably your safest bet. I heard 2018/2019 is a bit more reliable than the previous model but a failing transmission is not a fun thing to replace so that‚Äôs my recommendations,Nissan

Things i noticed. 

You have to use the parking brake. Idk if its cvt exclusive, if you park on a incline/decline and the cars weight rest on the pawl it will chunk da chunk and rack the car as you go thru shift position, not a good thing. You must stop, shift to neutral, active parking brake, release brake to car weight is slowly and safely resting on park brake, then shift to park. The weight must not be on the cvt its self. And unfortunately when i get tired work or ehat not i need to leage a nice note dictaded such on my car. I feel like a ass but it honestly feels like it's damaging.",Nissan

"- Can you? Yes, but get the TCM as well it has all the important data‚Äôs specific to the valve body in that unit.

"Smart precaution here‚Ä¶ this brought up one time when I picked up a passenger in the hills of hollywood. If you have ever been around Hollywood Hills, those hills are steep‚Ä¶ 20% to 30% grade easy‚Ä¶ you are literally looking up to the sky as you drive up them and they are narrow AF. So we were already on the way down and my passenger forgot something‚Ä¶. I was thinking Shit, no space to make a u turn and besides making a u utn on a steep incline might be sketchy. I did not want to drive all the way down, so I threw it in Reverse and all I can think of is my CVT belt having all the entire load‚Ä¶ I reversed slowly and carefully. My passenger was rather surprized that my Rogue made it, he said his Prius would never made it. I probably would drive down and turn back around next time that happens again, I wouls not want to put all the load in that cvt transmission ever again. So about the CVT service, I use to pay around $260 for this servis at the dealer, now with my local mechanic he charges me half that and he uses the Valvoline CVT fluid which is compatible with Nissan CVT, dont fall for the marketing scam that you have to use Nissan brand which is very expensive. Nissan do not make their own fluids, they just slap their labels on it. Its a sinple flush and fill, uou can save more by doing it yourself and spend around $50 on the 1 gallon valvoline cvt fluid or have a garage do it for around $120. I dont like dealing with the clean up and having to jack up my car so I would gladly pay someone to do this for me.",Nissan

The downstream O¬≤ sensors measure the efficiency, or efficacy of the cats. Once warmed up and at idle, the A/F ratio readings will go back and forth evenly, like a sin wave. The downstream reading should be steady. If the downstream reading goes up and down like the A/F reading, the cat isn't working as designed.",Nissan

Every dealership is basically instructed to say it must be done here and only here. It‚Äôs really not beneficial for a dealer to go through the hassle of setting up a mobile locksmith/key service.

"I own a 2017 diesel version, but here's what I know about the gas versions from the groups I'm in.

The factory warranty is nice, 5 years/100k miles

The VK56 is a solid engine, but some have ""cylinder 7"" issues. I don't know much about it but either most are taken care of or some people who are out of warranty ""just run it anyways"".

Pretty good power, not of the big 3 2500s, but what do you expect. It's a heavy half.

Fuel mileage is not impressive. Seriously. Lucky to get above 21 mpg on a good day unloaded. Even using premium gas or 91 octane or higher, which is the recommended fuel rating for the VK56. 

Gooseneck hitch is standard on Titan XDs if you are into hauling, but you may need to buy a hardware kit separate for the ball and chain hooks. 

Mods are available but not common. Z1 Offroad is a good starter place to buy mods. If you want suspension air bags to reduce towing squat, I'd recommend the AirLift Loadlifter 5000 Ultimate kit. Looks good and is good quality.

People sometimes have issues with Nissan Customer Service, even with issues covered under warranty. Some people had to get to the point of suing them in court to get them to repair something like a driveshaft snapping or transmission issues. The powertrain is mostly good, these are just examples. 

Interior is simple but nice. 

Best part? No cylinder deactivation. Mostly a solid truck with no extra gimmicks. Basically what most people need but either aren't aware of it or don't want it.",Nissan

you can‚Äôt just turbo every engine. you can only turbo charge built engines.

of course the supra and a lot of 90s japanese cars were an exception because that was during an economic boom for them. they *could* build strong engines and get away with it.

this nissan does not boast one of those engines. it was made to be a weak economy car that can only handle as much power as it makes right now. because they‚Äôre cheap and easy to make, which was perfect for nissan when they made this car.

if you turbo charge this car right now, within months or even days the engine will give out. the internals are not strong enough to take that amount of boost and your rod bearings will be toast.

"I don't think it's fair to call it a user issue when that year Nissans service guide doesn't even put transmission fluid change on a set interval.

Changing the transmission fluid is something I do for every car but the baseline expectation before you put problems on the customer I think is to follow the service plan... because if you know nothing about cars bringing it to the dealership to do the scheduled maintenance might be the only thing you do.",Nissan
Do a drain and fill.  The dealer is referring to old style multiple speed automatic transmissions when they suggest fear of damage from fluid flush.  CVT's are not the same in this comparison. Fresh cvt fluid will be fine. Then so another drain & fill in 3 months.  Use Nissan or Idemitsu or Eneos fluid.,Nissan

"ReCVT yes fluid drain and fill is recommended by owners at 30,000 or 60000 miles same as By Nissan. Not fluid flush. 
I had drain and fill done by independent shop. Nissan NS 3 provided by me. BG service adds warranty but if over 30,000 miles reduces to $2000 . Repeat every 30,000. 
At your mileage some say not to change fluid but that seems to come from conventional transmissions getting flush at high mileage causing problems. No owners concenus. 
So I recommend finding BG aftermarket service shop and doing drain and fill. Ask if you have external filter. Mine has one I had it changed while doing drain and fill. 6 qts instead of 4 qts. Again got filter o ring kits from Amazon. Dealer parts dept did not have in stock. Dealer would not change it !!!!",Nissan

"Honda or Toyota is probably always the best choice for teens, they‚Äôll last forever and they‚Äôre easy to take care of, but I haven‚Äôt owned one yet. Lexus is a popular recommendation too. Sentra isn‚Äôt an awful choice imo, if you get one of the newer ones and do the proper maintenance. Maybe I‚Äôm biased tho because my first car was a Volkswagen and those things need to be taken care of diligently which made it a bad first car lol

One maintenance highly recommended for any Nissan CVT is a transmission fluid drain and refill every 30k miles, which is about every 3 years typically. For me it‚Äôs about 450$ CAD (330$ usd) at the dealership. That can be a bit expensive.
Sentra is apparently estimated about 200$ a year more expensive to maintain than a Corolla or Civic. 

As for Sentra VS Altima CVT I think the difference is negligible, they‚Äôre manufactured by the same company so are prone to the same issue, but I‚Äôve heard that base model Altimas are typically one of the more reliable sedans produced by Nissan. I‚Äôm not a mechanic and haven‚Äôt owned an Altima tho so I can‚Äôt say for sure.  Sentra has a better MPG for fuel use though 

If you‚Äôre able, you could test drive a Sentra and test drive a Corolla or something similar at a dealership and see which one you enjoy more. Just whatever you choose make sure you look up the exact model and year and read about it a bit before finalizing any purchase, I wish I had done that but oh well.",Nissan

But let's talk about their lineup

Versa: Kill it OR, make it super cheap with a manual only

Sentra: Update it, give it the Nismo treatment, if the Elantra N, Civic Type R, Corolla GT, can exist, so can a Nismo variant with a 9 speed Auto

Altima: On Life Support, give it a HYBRID option, drop the CVT. I really want to see this nameplate become competitive again other then at the rental counter. 
Sport model with 2.0 VC-Turbo with 9speed Auto. Given 280hp similar to specs found in QX55.
Hybrid model: with CVT if they INSIST upon using that bitch ass transmission 

Maxima: RIP, rebirth as fully electricü§îü§î, Another HYBRID would be an amazing option
Also, with the Maxima and Q50 electric options being delayed until MY27, why not put the old reliable 3.7 in the Maxima, with the FM Platform and make it AWD only to further differentiate from the Altima, separate from the Q, and call it a Nismo variant, limiting it to 15k models produced as a bridge to their EV version. Nissan CAN'T AFFORD any product delays. Keep waiting Nissan and Hyundai/Kia will DEVOUR the rest of this market share, albeit small. Nissan letting the ICE Maxima go out properly opposed to the FWD/CVT variant would do two things: Increase the Value of the Maxima nameplate, and further increase the value and interest within the brand. Don't wanna use the 3.7, use that 3.0 liter turbo in Maxima rated to just 300hp with the 7spd auto. Leave the 9spd Auto and 400hp options exclusively to the Q. 

Frontier: Update the interior

Murano: Being updated, DROP THAT DAMN CVT, utilize their 2.0 or 3.0 liter turbocharged engines with a 9speed Auto 

Rogue: Plug In Hybrid with their ePower tech, get fucking for real, or forever live in Toyota and Honda's shadow 

Kicks: New model incoming, meh, but it works for the NPC consumer, make a sport version paying homage to the Juke, they'd sell an ass of this car

Z: Update the interior. The infotainment is cool, but those seats and those doors from 2007 called, they need that shit back, ASAP

GT-R: We will always love you. A Hybrid variant is a must. Update the current 3.8 with hybrid tech, move forward and continue to innovate Japanese sport cars

Armada: Look at the QX80, update it, by 2025


Infiniti: NO CVTs ALLOWED in these vehicles, differentiate from NISSAN at all costs: literally at this point

Q50: UPDATE THAT INTERIOR give it the ZF 9 speed auto and sell two distinguishable variants: the ICE version, and the EV version 

Q70: Turn it into a Fastback Wagon, with a panoramic moon roof on MOST models. RWD standard, AWD optional, utilize their 3.0 VR30DTT engine with 400 HP for a sports model. Create a hybrid variant or EV variant for ultra luxury model

QX30: What is it?? KILL IT!!

"Hey before I traded my 2018 Nissan Sentra with a CVT about a month ago I went to a trusted mechanic in our area and talk to him about the CVT transmission.

He said in his experience they do go out quite a bit. He also told me he can put them in all day long but he doesn't have the Nissan proprietary software to reprogram the transmission so even if he was to put a new one in it would still have to go to the dealership to get programmed. You might want to check on that. I'm no mechanic but I don't think you can swap those two transmissions. Maybe Nissan dealership doesn't have to program all models but definitely check.",Nissan

"Looks like you might be dealing with the dreaded Nissan CVT issue. I just got rid of a 2018 Nissan Sentra because of it. I know you've got better protections in Canada than we do in the US at least.

I wouldn't even play around and I would try to return the car. Even if they fixed it since you have a warranty there's a good chance it's going to go out again because they replace it with the same terrible transmission. It could take a little while or it could happen really soon. I was always wondering when mom was going to break.

Definitely try to just return that Nissan and don't get another one. A lot of their models have that transmission. Other companies use CVT transmissions but Nissan ones are the worst.

I had no idea about the issue a few years ago when I bought the car. So good to have gotten rid of it. The Nissan dealership in my area never has any loaners and it also takes them an average of a month or so to get to your vehicle because they're so backed up with warranty work. at least that's what a technician told me when I pulled into the side and asked him honestly what he would do and he told me he would get rid of that car.

Maybe it's something else but I doubt it, especially with the jerking and the RPMs going up.

Good luck!",Nissan
"It's a 10 year old car. Nissans obligation was over a long time ago.

I never understood this. Wouldn‚Äôt you want your car to feel smooth without any signs of shifting. I loved the way my pathfinder felt when driving.,Nissan
I thought only the sedans and rouge had the CVT‚Äôs. The pathfinder and frontier and Titan should not have CVT‚Äôs.,Nissan
I mean Honda and Toyota are more reliable BUT (idk about this gen Sentra) Nissans are pretty reliable too. My family has a 2007 Altima with almost 300k miles but it got totaled and we replaced it with a 2008 altima because of how reliable the 07 was. We also have 2 Sentra from 2012 and they both are over 100k miles and they are still running perfectly fine. We also have a 2016 pathfinder and it has 30k miles and still runs fine. Non had ever caused us issues. That‚Äôs my story though.,Nissan

"Me, no way!! No power.",Nissan
"it has nothing that makes it ‚Äútunable‚Äù. sure throw a turbo on it and you‚Äôll have rod knock on a couple months.

there‚Äôs just no aftermarket tuning support for this car because it wasn‚Äôt intended to be a car that could be tuned whatsoever. it doesn‚Äôt have any fancy suspension that makes it fast around corners, it has a low power engine that was made to run only on the base power so they could produce a lot of them for cheap, and no one sells anything aftermarket or cool because the car just isn‚Äôt good.

the only possible way you could make this car cool is by taking the engine out and fabricating engine mounts to put a different engine in. which takes years and tons of money for even experienced mechanics.

my advice? look into sports cars on facebook marketplace and do research. watch youtube videos, look on reddit, and ultimately find a car that‚Äôs more set up for what you want to do.

a lot of people start out the way you do because they have an emotional connection to their car and want to make it cool. they end up making an embarrassment out of themselves because the only ‚Äúcool‚Äù parts they can find are the generic hood scoops that only show how stupid you are (because hood scoops are not made for cars without superchargers or carburetors). and they also waste a lot of money into it

i personally think you‚Äôre looking for some kind of civic. years 80-2010. those are pretty much the nissan sentra but with tuning capabilities.

"So did you get stranded or need maintenance already? Is that why you called the roadside company? There's a lot of loose and vague language that car guys may use.

If someone (several someones) is saying maintenance isn't enough to make this not happen and you insist further information that we all already had...it's frustrating to converse with someone.

Or do you really believe that ""regular maintenance"" will prevent nearly two decades of this issue from occuring. I'm sorry but these aren't a sensor that cost a couple hundred dollars. It was $5k quote to replace the one we had, on a vehicle not even worth that much and was still being paid for. This is a lot of money and time we're  talking about.

My Sentra had water infiltration fixed 5 times, one of the rubber parts on the windshield flew off on the highway, almost lost a wheel due to the wheelhub not being tight enough from factory, the part with the window buttons on the door followed my hand instead of the button lifting and closing the window so the dealership replaced it, and a few other small things. Now it's starting to lose power and I have to downshift to keep my speed where I didn't need to before. At least it's a manual and not a cvt. The dealership also had shit service and ended up telling me to never go there again so I decided to never again go for a Nissan.",Nissan
Yep exactly my point lol,Nissan
It's a 1997. They didn't have CVTs back then.,Nissan
"No, lol. Not at all. 

They are still using a CVT (their particular CVT is ass) and now they decided to push a 1.5 cylinder turbo variable compression direct injected engine. Lmfao.

The really really sad thing is the Toyota Rav4 4cylinder traditional automatic gets the same or better MPG. Nissan is filled with clowns.

That being said, Toyota is in their stride when it comes to Japanese reliability. They're the best selling cars in America for a damned good reason. Gonna be hard to bounce back from that CVT fiasco (What a piece of shit those were). No one trust Nissan for reliability anymore because of the CVT. Hell, when they absorbed Datsun and became just Nissan, their quality was going down. 

Ive owned a 79 Z straight 6 that wouldn't die and an 05' 2.5l Altima right before that CVT crap came out. The Z was a legend and the Altima was actually a decent car. Neither left me on the side of the road. Around 200k miles before sold the Altima and the Z had around 350k before I wrecked it.

Yet I come home around 10pm and I look at the price and I'm like this ain't right. Sure enough, I agreed to a warranty package. Called them up next morning, went back, and they agreed to remove it. Guy was difficult about it too ""have to open the contract again"". And ""if you drive off and the camera system fails, that's a $3,500 repair"". I told him I'd take my chances.

Nuts. Still don't get how that got on there. I blame myself for being tired. Because all I remember is declining everything. Luckily it got removed.",Nissan
"Thanks. I agree. Nissan says Sport doesn't do anything until you exceed a speed of 20 mph. Beyond that, things get murky. I've read where steering and suspension are tightened up. But it doesn't say that in our Owner's Manual. This is what it does say:

""**ON position**: For driving up or down long slopes where engine braking is necessary, or for powerful acceleration, use the ON position. The transmission will automatically select a different gear ratio, allowing the engine to provide high output.""

A Nissan dealer claims this is what Sport does in a 2024 Sentra:

* **Sport Mode:** Sport Mode enhances throttle response, sharpens steering, and optimizes gear shifts for a sportier feel. 

I like this guy's general explanation of what Sport Mode does. He basically says it triggers more fuel dump into the engine than normal throttle mapping would do:

[https://www.gearpatrol.com/cars/what-does-sport-mode-do/](https://www.gearpatrol.com/cars/what-does-sport-mode-do/)

Most likely a part called the ‚Äúwindow regulator‚Äù the fact you can hear it trying means it‚Äôs not the switch or the motor or the wiring because the motor is still trying just can‚Äôt move the window.

I was like well that doesn't sound too bad.

After sitting in the lobby for about 7 hours, no fucking joke, I finally get a little heated and I go back there to talk to him and the manager of that department was like well we've got it up on the machine we just can't find it. When I dropped it off I explained to them all they had to do was turn it to the right give it a little bit of gas and they would hear it. 

I said pull it off the lift man and I'll show you right now and he's like okay but you're not going to be able to make it happen. As soon as we got in the car in the parking lot I barely tapped the gas why I turned it to the right and it was like pop pop pop. He looked embarrassed and then said okay we'll order the part there's only one thing that can be. SMH.

I guess just all technicians aren't created equally just like other professions.

The ADAS system went out for no reason and my cruise control wouldn't work. Boy they couldn't get it recalibrated for anything. I watch some master mechanics do it online in like an hour. These guys had the car for like 2 weeks and they assured us they were working on it and just couldn't figure it out. Almost $4,000 for that little radar sensor.

That's exactly what I figured too.,Nissan
"The big downside though is that while serial hybrids are simpler and consistent, they are also less efficient.  That's why all the MPG queens out there can switch to series or parallel as needed (parallel has less efficiency losses since the gas is directly motivating the wheels instead of having to be converted from rotational power into electrical power back into rotational power).

Pretty sure it's a chain but if you could post a picture of your engine bay it would help. Chains don't tend to have a replacement interval so if its running well with no lights on the dash and no rattles from the engine then all is well. Best way to look after them is regular oil changes.,Nissan

This car isn't something that you should even try to mod into it street demon as you call it.

If you wanted to turn this into something that's going to beat these other cars, you'd essentially need to put a different motor in it.

Any mods that you could do to this that would give you a chance would drastically decrease its reliability and are not cost-effective.

You could put a cold air intake on it and a high flow exhaust but you're not going to get a noticeable performance increase. You're just going to lower the fuel mileage.

Trying to slap a turbo on this would be a waste of money and again make it much less reliable and even potentially destroy the engine. And then you'd still have to pay off the car loan.",Nissan

"True. That's why I'm glad there's at least a Sport option in our Sentra. I'm not the primary driver. But when I drive it, I want a little more responsiveness when I push on the gas.

Your comment got me thinking: just how fast is our Sentra? Turns out the top speed is 120 mph. When I started looking at top speeds of similar cars, it's downright scary.

For example, the 2023 Subaru WRX, VW GTI, and Elantra N all have top speeds of 155 mph! Several more also top out at 155 or more, which blows my mind. I tried to hit 100 in my first car, a '71 Mustang 302 (not Boss), and the engine sounded like it was coming apart!

That's not listed in the index either. However, Sport Mode does appear in the Starting and Driving section on page 301. So if I had started reading 10 pages/day of the Owner's Manual the day after we drove the car home, I would've reached Sport Mode in the manual at the start of month 2.

Like I tried to say originally, it would've been nice if Nissan had not **hidden** Sport Mode. Be proud of it! Nissan is obviously proud of ECO Mode because it has its own button/switch with ECO painted green. Sport Mode is hiding on the back of the shifter, like an abandoned puppy.

"Do you have emissions testing where you live?

Yes: replace the cat but try to avoid OEM simply due to cost. You might get lucky and get a generic cheap cat off Amazon to work. They are cheap enough to replace yearly, even, remember your job is to pass emissions, not to turn off the engine light permanently. The reason here is these cats don't usually go out on their own. There's a reason it shit the bed. Blown head gasket, scored cylinder walls burning oil, etc. It'll ruin a new cat too. Maybe try and remove the car and clean it, YouTube some cleaning videos. I think there might even be fuel additives that clean cats but from what I've seen they don't work, but it's worth a try!

I would not repair with OEM unless I 100% knew I wasn't burning oil or coolant or there were other engine problems that chew threw cats.

if the metal can be brought back around and it can be aligned, then the next bit would be air bags and likely getting the computer to not think it's still crashed with used up air bags. though i wonder if you could still drive it that way? that's a whole other topic and probably not the safest.",Nissan

"The sensors don't usually fail electrically (not impossible that yours haven't of course) but they do usually start leaking either at the valve seat or the alloy corrodes and leaks so just make sure the pressures are actually correct. 

As for resetting the TPMS, you should have a ""display"" button in your gauge cluster (square icon that you can cycle through your MPG and fuel range with). You'll need to turn the engine off but have the ignition on, then press the ""display"" button until the TPMS symbol appears with ""SET"" below it, then hold the ""display"" button until the symbol stops flashing.

Wouldn't worry about the fuel range thing, it should go back to normal now that it's not forgetting your MPG history when the battery dies.

Auto headlight issue I'm not sure about, the sensor I think is circular and is at the top of the dash near the windscreen so check it's not fallen into the dash or something. Not a common failure on these so this could be a mystery. Might also be the switch but I'm just guessing really.

"Well, firstly, the main CVT issues applied to older models (2018 and earlier) whereas the new ones are fairly robust.

Secondly, Nissan isn't the only company to use a CVT, and they are fairly standard across most brands sold today.

Last of all, there is a notable overlap between Nissan/Hyundai/Kia owners and bad maintenance habits. The amount of times I get a customer that declines their transmission service and other vital tasks is nuts to me. Yeah, Nissan sells fairly cost-effective vehicles, but I'd think that people would still want to protect their investment.

For instance, we had a person that was in for a diag on an airbag light, and the tech noted that they hadn't changed their oil in 7k miles. This car was still under warranty, mind you. They declined the oil change and then came back roughly 7k miles later complaining of engine noise. The engine was completely sludged. It was under warranty but their claim was denied because of their lack of maintenance. Nearly $30k down the drain, and that is just one example.

Maintain your cars, people. They aren't something you just hop in and drive every day without making sure things are taken care of.",Nissan

"I just traded in a 2018 Nissan Sentra with 51,000 MI and grab a 2024 Honda Civic sport. My transmission was it messing up yet but it was one of the worst years with the CVT problems.

The Nissan dealership in my area started a lifetime powertrain warranty on their new cars if you follow the recommended maintenance. I still couldn't pull the trigger and risk that much cash on something they've had so many problems with over the last few years, well more tham few.

Shortly after I got the Honda I saw some article I don't remember who it was by and I had the worst vehicles of 2024 so far and the Nissan Sentra was up there on it, maybe number one. I know you can't always trust those but still.

Everything about the Honda feels more solid than the Nissan. It feels good not worrying about the transmission going out also. The dealership in my area is backed up with transmission work or at least that's what they said. So they never have loners available and it takes him awhile to even get to your vehicle if something happens. It was just too much to deal with. A lot of brands use CVT transmissions it just seems like Nissan uses the crappy ones.",Nissan

At least this time I get a 3year or 100k mile warranty from transmission shop that installed it.

Ironically the motors are known to be pretty good (the 2.5L 4 cylinder )  Aside from having the camshaft sensor and crankshaft sensors, removed, cleaned and tested about 2 years ago. Its always ran fine and good on gas, smooth ride.    I do love the seats and smooth ride and tech included.  but man o man those CVT's really are its weakness.     I know all cars have their issues, but CVT Nissans just happen to have a very expensive common problem.",Nissan

It really helps in reducing the fuel consumption. But yes, it's slower to accelerate. Once you reach the required speed, it's best to continue cruising on Eco!",Nissan

"Out of curiosity, how many batteries have you gone through in that same time period?  
And is there any kind of aftermarket electronics work, specifically a new stereo or sub/amplifier?  
Most of my experience is from the Infiniti side of the family, but I replaced an alternator on all my higher mileage vehicles. In general, the diode packs in Nissan alternators go out after about 150k miles or so. This is important to know, since often times it may even test like nothing is wrong, and then fry battery cells. Or not charge and leave you sitting on the freeway without the juice needed to even run your hazards - in the middle of a merge ramp (ask me how I know this).  
Point being, a bad battery will toast an alternator, and a bad alternator will toast a battery. If you have a known bad alternator, replace the battery at the same time, since once those diodes do out, you‚Äôre doing all kinds of bad things to the electrical system and the battery is what absorbs the shock.  
As for replacement- and any mechanic should know this - always bench test an alternator *before* they install it. I‚Äôve had almost every aftermarket alternator fail within warranty period but that still means installing it again. And I don‚Äôt enjoy installing the alternator the first time, let alone again 6 months later. Now I have the parts place bench test everything. OEM is usually safer from DOA than aftermarket/rebuilds, but still safer to check.",Nissan

"If they put the 1.5VCT and CVT-X in it, it would probably cost just as much as the Rogue.  While there is always some overlap from highest trim of one to lowest trim of the other, the subcompact class is generally expected to be cheaper than the compact class.

There is a market for high performance subcompacts, but right now that's already covered by the Mazda CX-30 Turbo  and the Dodge Hornet GT which will both run you about $35K+ and get you around 24/25mpg combined on premium... that's more of a niche market.",Nissan
"I would really watch out because you're probably going to have issues with the CVT transmission. If you do buy used one you're going to have to have all of the maintenance paperwork in case something happens and if you don't have it all the warranty work will probably get denied. Also my local Nissan dealership is backed up with transmission work and they never have any loaners and it would also take them about a month to get to your vehicle if something happened.

I just traded in a 2018 Nissan Sentra with 51,000 miles and I'm so glad I did. I used to be a big Nissan fan but not anymore. A lot of companies use CVT but only Nissan ones seem to have the big big issues.

Some of them have other issues besides the transmission like going through CVC joints.

If I was you I would definitely pass. I would watch out for Hyundai as well they have a bunch of models with terrible motors and the insurance can be outrageous and depending on the area you live in it could get stolen, or at least broke into and vandalized.

I would highly recommend you save up a few more dollars and grab something from Honda or Toyota. If you like worrying and want to be without a car go ahead and grab you a Nissan or a Hyundai. The problem is with the Nissan transmission that about $5,000 even if you have it replaced it's another crappy one that's going to break again most likely.",Nissan

Replace your radiator and coolant reservoir caps first, if they don't hold the correct pressure they can cause you to lose coolant. Look for bulging hoses or hoses that have stains on them, one may have a pinhole. If that doesn't do it my next suspicion would be the head gasket, which could be related to the limp mode problem if water is leaking into the cylinder overnight.",Nissan

The transmission control computer keeps track of the degradation level of the fluid and also has a counter that tells you how often it has overheated. Those transmissions have huge problems with overheating and self-destruction in general. 

Most transmission faults on Nissans will not trip the check engine light or the CVT light and other than the fluid degradation index (which is supposed to be reset when you change the fluid) and the overheat counter, there's no history in the ECU or TCU.",Nissan
"Hope you‚Äôre alright, I‚Äôve done this before.  

Like said pervious $1500+. I‚Äôd say this is well over 3k if you‚Äôre in Canada.  

Check your insurance, some have claims where you can pay it back.  

And if you don‚Äôt want to go through your insurance company, call around to a couple body shops and tell them you need a deal on some front end work that‚Äôs not insurance related.  You could order a new headlight and even a fender, bumper etc online if you scour the web and then ask said body shops if you can pay them cash for the labour.  They‚Äôll have the other parts and can fine tune it.",Nissan

"Just got back from getting serviced.. Every car had a dealership markup of 15k, The new Nissan Z (Not sure what model it was) was 80k lol.",Nissan
You don‚Äôt need that it‚Äôs one of those useless parts put on by the manufacturer just to throw a couple codes and get you to spend money in their shop. Just throw it away and have a local shop clear the codes,Nissan

"Utterly disposable, wrecked or broken beyond repair by 100k. People don‚Äôt like to hear that this is unsustainable, but the USDM is about to be a really tight spot on. Purchasing power is reduced year after year, and cars get more expensive as more and more modules are stuffed into them. Cheaply made, easily broken, and most can‚Äôt afford repair costs. Automakers will have to cut back on some of this to keep costs down.",Nissan
There‚Äôs a mechanism inside the steering wheel that causes it to stay locked. That is a known problem. I forgot what it‚Äôs called like a steel wheel lock actuator you‚Äôll have to Google it. I had to replace my Altima was about 300 bucks.,Nissan
Haha yeah.,Nissan
"Sounds like the caliper is at least partially frozen. For a 2020, that‚Äôs likely a manufacturers defect.  
If you took it to a Nissan dealership those other times, back when it was under warranty, I‚Äôd take it back, talk to the same service rep if available and politely get the service manager involved. Politely remind that you brought it in back when it was under warranty and the cause of the problem remained elusive. (Key here is to not play a blame game, and don‚Äôt get mad).  
Service managers can stretch those warranty times and get concessions from Nissan - but if someone is combative or mean, they also have the power to point at the warranty expiry date and shrug.",Nissan
"Yes. Mines really random. For like 30 mins on the highway yesterday it was completely on, then for like 2 hour it drove without the light coming on at all. I‚Äôd have your belt and tensioner and pulleys checked again. Since yours doesn‚Äôt come on at high rpm‚Äôs could be some slack somewhere. When at a higher rpm things spin faster. Make sure you have no battery corrosion anywhere, if none of those work I‚Äôm out of ideas. I‚Äôm just gonna drive mine till it doesn‚Äôt, but so far other than an annoying light it hasn‚Äôt given me trouble",Nissan
That cheap ass rim (probably winter rims) should be the least of your worries. You should be more concerned with chassis and suspension damage. I doubt your suspension is just gonna take a hit like that like a champ,Nissan

"If you can afford it, definitely go for a Toyota if you're looking for reliability. With Nissan nowadays, it's a hit or miss. There are drivers plagued with electronic issues and transmission issues. Nissan made good cars, and they still make good reliable trucks and SUVs. If you're relying on reliability, then go for a Toyota. I'll be honest, though, Toyota and Honda have gone down quite a bit in their quality as well they are still good cars. Either way, 6 matter what you get. Keep up with maintenance on the severe schedule with oil changes not more than 5-6 thousand miles and transmission fluid at 30k miles. It doesn't matter what the dealership tells you about lifelong or extended maintenance or lifetime fluid or long-lasting oil. The car won't last very long past warranty if you follow the longer extended intervals.",Nissan
"Potentially one of three possible easy fixes:

First, clean the port on your phone. You will be disgusted by how much lint, dust, dead skin is in there. 

Second, update your phone‚Äôs IOS if you haven‚Äôt. If you have recently, check CarPlay settings in your phone to see if they changed. 

Third, if you don‚Äôt have your car set up for wifi, do so if possible.  Nissan will send out OTA software updates and your head unit will download them automatically.",Nissan
Thanks very much üëç,Nissan
"It depends on the extent of the engine damage and frame, imo. You can get bumpers/hoods/any panel from junkyards for cheap. If the engine is in relatively good shape and the frame isn't fucked, I would only shell out real money for airbag replacements.

That said, if the radiator's pushed back and the doors don't shut all the way, it's totalled. Move on.",Nissan

In all that time, our Altima has never failed us.  We keep up with the maintenance schedule, and it has been the most reliable car I've ever owned.  Maintenance is key.",Nissan

As for interior features unless you‚Äôre a picky chooser on the most unnecessary modern tech shit I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much a diff between 2020-2021 prolly the same Apple CarPlay/ touch screen,dash steering and all that.

Fair enough.  Lots of places this don't fly tho.,Nissan
You can turn either way. It will not lock.,Nissan
"From what I can remember, the G37 in the US doesn't have a steering wheel lock but maybe the Japan ones do? Anyways, since you're having a no start problem, if it says key fob not detected or key fob incorrect, try holding the key fob to the start button to see if the fob battery is running low. If not that, and it makes a single click noise instead of starting, I would check the starter, they tend to fail at higher mileage or sometimes get oil on them and fail, though on a G37 they're a bit rarer than on something like a QX80.
       
It could be a lot of different things, so if none of those work I would have someone diagnose it or at least look at the codes and go from there.",Nissan
"Nissan is removing the Qashqai/Rogue Sport from their line up, and the Kicks is getting a size increase to take its place. May also have an all wheel drive option.

Great ground clearance and AWD really sell me on this. Offers a great advantage over FWD only competitors Venue and Trax/Envista as well as the uselessly low ground clearance AWD competition.

This. Not sure why go through all that money and trouble for something that *might* work when you can just take it back to the dealer for a 4WD.,Nissan
I‚Äôd almost suggest gettting a rogue because the kicks is an entry level small hatch backs that‚Äôs cheaply made.  The rogue would most likely do you better justice.,Nissan
"Agreed, on the cost aspect. But I'm sure there would be takers of a loaded Kicks with more power over a stripped Rogue even if at a higher price. As I'm sure there would be people that value space vs extra equipment at the overlapping price point. Subaru has certainly exploited that with Crosstrek Sport/Foz. I'd still place most of the emphasis on wanting to push more people into the larger (and more profitable vehicle).",Nissan
Yea that means your front sensor is blocked so your forward collision or automatic braking systems might not work. This happens to me sometimes when it‚Äôs raining like crazy and there‚Äôs too much water on the sensor,Nissan

Last time I was in the market, I test drove a Qashqai (a.k.a. Rogue Sport) with the same motor in the hope it would feel even slightly fun and it turned out to be the most miserably underpowered sad little thing I‚Äôd ever driven. If there were an optional KR20 VC Turbo or even KR15 for the Kicks, it might actually live up to its name and I‚Äôd be far more enthusiastic about it.",Nissan
Do. Not. Buy a Nissan with a cvt. Look up the amount of lawsuits and failures. We have a 13 Sentra that went out at 62k miles. We only got it replaced because of a lawsuit and towing it an hour away to the only dealership that would honor it. They haven't changed parts manufacturer and I've heard reports of similar issues in newer ones.,Nissan
"The Note died for this as well. I didn‚Äôt really want a Kicks but I live in the city and I needed something fuel efficient, plus I didn‚Äôt feel like paying $7k for a new trans when the replacement CVT gave up the ghost.

"I have a Nissan Sentra 2015, bought brand new, and I‚Äôm the only owner. The car has been maintained by book and recommendations - I have done everything! 

However, once I hit 80K, I started having a rain of issues. I have had to replace at about 80K brake cylinder, break booster and something else because when I push the break pedal, it goes in and it gets stuck and it wouldn‚Äôt come back !! Then at 90K miles I had to replace struts, I have AC issues - the hot and cold keep blowing whenever it wants - I brought it in twice for that the dealership can‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs wrong, I am at 110K miles on it, recently I had to replace some parts on the engine, other little things and now I will need new shocks, and to top it off I was JUST told by the dealership that my transmission is making a noise and will have to be replaced soon.

This is on top of regular maintenance - oil changes and filter changes, break pads, fluids on breaks and transmission fluids ‚Ä¶ 
I think I spent so much money on parts and labor that I might be better off buying a new car to be honest. 

Every year I spent around 7K on this car.",Nissan

"The newer stuff is definitely crap by comparison, but I don't have a ton of firsthand experience with them because I've avoided them mostly.  The 4cyl cvts were absolute junk for sure though.

For the undiagnosed trunk open issue, could it be something like hitting the trunk button when the keys are in your pocket and a warning/door light doesn't show up until a bump?  I had to trim the plastic nub on the back of the trunk button inside my fob to make it less sensitive so I would stop ""butt dialing"" my car",Nissan

The up side to the kicks is that it is the cheapest new car you can get with the all around view camera(at least for Canada), that's the biggest reason my parents have one ordered coming in a couple of weeks.
Other than it being a newer car, and the taller cabin will help with your husband's head, all seems to be a slight downgrade from the civic",Nissan

You saying that the car will not move **at all** tells me that either the torque converter is completely dead with no fluid pressure (did you shoot a hole in it? For it not to move at all... That's zero pressure, so you use your trans as target practice? See any puddles in your driveway?) or the belt has decided to commit suicide kind of like the recent Boeing whistleblower by shooting itself twice in the back of the head, and those codes are just what the shrapnel inside your transmission decided to trigger.

the only problem my versa gave me was the steering column started to make a noise but that was replaced under warranty. i decided to trade it in because while people claims nissan has improved the cvt in the newer models its still not refined and i still had my doubts. the cvt in my versa would hang after accelerating (while it wasn‚Äôt all the time) and it wasn‚Äôt smooth in stop and go traffic. it also was very underpowered (you have to literally plan to merge and pass or else you will risk getting into an accident) and it was also too tiny and i honestly just missed my civic.. it‚Äôs simply a much better car.. quality and performance wise.

yeah while my new civic has a cvt but it‚Äôs much more refined.. my 2015 civic also had a cvt and it was much more refined than my 2023 versa.

"How sure are you the alternator is the problem this time? There is a 3 pin connector that goes to the alternator and they are prone to failing. I usually recommend replacing the connector as well as the alternator. Battery should be replaced with the alternator as well unless it is less then 3 years old and tests good.if you had a dealer put an OEM alternator in it has parts and labor warranty of 1 year, 12k miles. You said slightly over a year, but the dealer can goodwill it and replace under warranty even if it over the year or mileage.

So the throttle position sensor that's part of the throttle body has two data lines for redundancy. The fact that you're getting a correlation error means that one of the two connections is broken or corroded. Or the throttle body itself is bad.

I hope whoever has it now is enjoying it as much as i have and is taken great care of my Black Pearl.",Nissan

EDIT: maybe junkyard air bags aren't too hefty in cost? ive never had the air bags deploy for me when i brought mine around. then again one is disabled. for all know the other isn't even there. i can tells its been smashed long before i owned it.

If they can sell an Altima for $27K with that engine, then it would still work in the Kicks top two trims, and its naturally aspirated so no concerns about where to mount the intercooler and what not.

The Rogue got a brand new powertrain after its first year, so who knows, they might make that available for the Kicks in the future.",Nissan

Might be a radar sensor issue. Or body control module.  Unfortunately you have to get it scanned. Nissan should only charge u 1 hour of labor to scan it. My dealership charges 125 for the hour.,Nissan

"This code has popped up intermittently for me. Most recently last week but the one before that popped up like almost a year ago. In the factory service manual it tells me it can be spark plugs, improper ignition timing, fuel injector leaks, exhaust leaks. Do you think its always a cat death code? The last last time it popped up about a year ago I truly believe it‚Äôs because of what i did with my scanner to raise ignition timing by 2 . I immediately put it back to normal and cleared the code and it never popped up until last week. I cleared the code and plan to change plugs this Thursday but so far hasn‚Äôt popped up. 2013 sentra btw",Nissan
"Thank you, this seems like sound advice. I'm just worried that using an aftermarket cat won't clear my codes, because I had a friend who bought an aftermarket one for his Chevy Cruze and the codes wouldn't clear.

"Nissan isn't whstvthey used to be. I just trade a 2018 Sentra with 51,000 miles. 2 CVC joints, the ADAS/Radar system went out for no reason and took a super long time and was super expensive, luckily the third party warranty covered it cuz it was almost $4,000. The steering with starting to act funny, and I was also starting to hear another popping sound from a CVC joint going out again. My extended warranty from the class action was going to be up this August.

I went Honda. It was out of them or Toyota and I liked the Civic sport better than the Corolla SE. Everything about the Honda feels better and more solid.

People on this sub aren't as bad as on the Hyundai sub but I don't know why people are still buying them. I know every car company has their issues but over the last 10 or 15 years there's certain ones that have just had way too many issues.

The CVT transmission was going to be a problem also. The dealership in my area was backed up with transmission work and never had any loaner cars and it also would take them over a month to get to your vehicle. And then you get the same terrible transmission back in there.

I'm over Nissan personally.",Nissan

Anything they make with a CVT is a hard-pass.

The Titan is also unremarkable.  They're discounting them, but so is RAM, so I don't see a reason to buy the Nissan.

The Frontier can be a decent value if you plan to keep it forever.  If you want to sell within 10-ish years I'd still pass and just buy the Toyota Tacoma, however, because any savings from initial purchase will evaporate with the weaker resale.

Overall I'd say it's safer to just pass on Nissan as a brand.",Nissan

"I just got rid of a 2018 Nissan Sentra that just hit 51,000 Miles because of the CVT transmission. The class action extended warranty for my car was going out this August I believe. When I had to go in for some warranty work to the Nissan dealership they were backed up with transmission work, or at least that's what the technician told me. Another problem was dealerships usually only keep two loaner cars of each type of vehicle so they never had loaners. Since they were backed up with other warranty work it would take them a long time to get to my vehicle. What really made me get rid of it was always thinking about it if it was going to go out and I was going to have to be without a vehicle or pay a lot for a rental. Then I find out that even if you get it fixed under warranty or something like that it's the same model transmission that's just going to screw up again. I just couldn't do it.

If you're thinking about whether to trade it in or not just ask yourself a few questions. Can you be without a vehicle for a while? Can you pay around $5,000 or so for another transmission if the warranty doesn't cover it if you don't have all the maintenance records? Are you the type of person it's kind of like me and would just worry about it all the time?

All I can say is in the area I live in you don't see many models of Nissan with those CVT problems on the road. I'm not in a huge area though but you used to see the newer Nissan's all the time.

I spent a few grand more and went with a Honda and everything about it feels better. A lot of companies do use CVT transmissions but Nissan ones are just awful.",Nissan

this car only has external photos, no measurements on the frame horns or tally on internal damage from me. shops replace whole assemblies not just single bits. 

OH THERE IS A DENT INSIDE THE QUARTER PANEL! time to tears ALL the sheet metal out of the car!! 

as example check out BlueCollarKyle on Snap Chat to see OEM panels reinstalled like on the factory floor for an all new again car.

for my own work a salvage title that isn't always necessary so long as the finally panels alignments is close enough. key word close enough, i've seen cars that look the employees were drunk when fitting panels, though mostly thats on much older cars before Manufacturing tech  advanced. even then they still have some play for when the stamping presses aren't perfect and robot arms a small amount of play in them when fitting panels up pre spot weld.

so thats where you come to DIY or drive the family on the auto bahn brand new. for DIY that's assuming the skill and know how is there and it's truly not super fucked up, like a super bent frame horn.

any one who still doubts, i doubt i will ever convince. all i can say is check out the B is for Build Lotus. also not everyone can have the DIY option. i was raised in shops. and my car has held out structurally for me twice now, even though i'm pretty sure it was crashed more than once before i had it. best $7 grandpappy ever spent for a car. *knocks on wood*",Nissan

"Wow!! It looks damn near identical except for the stupid rock chip guard that mine has. I hope you enjoy it, I love mine. Any plans for modifications?",Nissan
it was low on fluid (thank god),Nissan
I‚Äôve never had any serious issues with any of my Nissans .. I had a 2010 Altima that had 130k miles when i sold it and i currently own a 2013 pathfinder with 150k along with a 2017 maxima with 70k and i never serviced the cvts . Seems like the people who have cvt issues are those who start messing with the cvt . I will say all 3 of my Nissans faithfully had driver window issues lol,Nissan
"It may bolt up, but what would you do to control the 9AT? I‚Äôm sure the ECU interface is different. Would it even fit in the transmission tunnel? Would it even connect electronically? At some point you gotta just bit the bullet and just buy that car with the features you want.  ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ",Nissan

Did you push the start button in with the fob with your foot on the brake pedal ?,Nissan
It can also happen if the sun is really low on horizon but still strong so it interferes with the camera. But in that case the light is just temporary on,Nissan
"What is the company name for your maintenance plan?

You said you have a copy of the contract, if it's a security plus, contact consumer affairs and tell them as such, they can and will get it entered in the system for you, just need your sales contract and a copy of the policy.",Nissan
"I had a 2014 Nissan Note and the timing belt started to go after about 100,000 miles. The main symptom was a loud ticking noise from the engine when I pushed the accelerator. It was going to cost a lot to replace (around ¬£2000!). Car was only worth ¬£2400 part exchange by then, so I ended up trading it in for a new Qashqai.",Nissan
"I wouldn‚Äôt change it now. If it hasn‚Äôt been changed regularly leave it alone, from what I‚Äôve read and researched the existing fluid will be thicker, dirtier and have higher viscosity. Change for new fluid and run a higher risk of belt slip. 

I just went through same dilemma on a Sentra with 115k that never had cvt fluid change. In the end i dropped the cash on plugs, belts, rotors and pads etc but left the cvt alone. Hope it last for another 50k or so. 

PS i called 2 or 3 Nissan dealers and they all said same regarding this.",Nissan
"Jump over to the /r/nissanrogue subreddit, but it sounds like a cvt issue.  (Quasquai is a rogue sport in the US). 

I don‚Äôt know what you paid for the car, but a coworker of mine has a 17 rogue and is looking at a 9,000 bill to replace his transmission (Toronto)

I would probably be walking away from the car unless they put a new CVT in it given in Ontario it sounds like you have those protections.",Nissan
