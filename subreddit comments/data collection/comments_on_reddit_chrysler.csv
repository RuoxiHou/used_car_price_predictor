"Have you scanned the check engine light? By default remote start is disabled with a check engine light on.

Remove the serpentine belt and try running it with it off‚Ä¶sounds like the alternator clutch pulley.,chrysler
Is the check engine light on? Usually the remote start gets disabled when there is a known issue.,chrysler
Dealership should replace all might be a issue with the relay or possibly a ground in the system. Good luck,chrysler

"My 97 convertible was making the same noise. It‚Äôs was the knuckle that connected to the steering pump, just greased it up and it was fine",chrysler
It‚Äôs not the hardest job I just did the spark plugs on one today and since I had to take off the intake I did that too . Hardest part for me was all the clips . Trying not to break them .  I‚Äôll send you the Mitchell steps for it,chrysler

Oo okay no this is the only code that popped up,chrysler
regulations killed the crossfire and the viper.  thank the government.  it's not that designers forgot how to draw.,chrysler
Yup,chrysler
I figured out when I took the switch out I noticed the connector had a lot more wires going into it and the switched only had 8 -10 pins went out to an auto parts store found one that had more pins plugged it in and everything worked as it should! Even the passenger window will roll down with its designated switch. My guess is the dealer maybe took a switch out a different model or later model. That or there is a bigger issue and in few days if this shits out I‚Äôll still take it to the dealer to trace the bigger problem.,chrysler
Not sure if I‚Äôd call that last gen Sebring a ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù,chrysler

"I have two vehicles with the 3.6 V6.   Both of them had the thermostat fail.

When I changed the one on my Grand Caravan, the OEM was the only one available, so that's what I installed.

When I changed the one on me Journey, Dorman had the aftermarket aluminum version available, so that is what's running on that car.  It has zero issues.

Rockauto has the aluminum Dorman version for something like ~$22.  

When the OEM version on my van inevitably fails again, I'm going with the aluminum one to replace it.

This is an easy DIY job btw, but just take it easy on the bolts.   The part it screws into is also made of plastic.",chrysler

"When we were looking for our replacement van after our first 5th gen got totaled, we specifically asked if they had had their transmissions replaced if they were 90k miles or up. We eventually settled on a 68k miles van that was a very reasonable price, but we almost went with a very similar one with 40k more miles but a new transmission.

Might want to keep that in mind while you're searching! Best of luck to you!",chrysler
"What reason did they give to not perform the recall? Too many miles, VIN not in the covered group, the cat was previously totalled, etc?",chrysler
"I'll be curious to know if I was right, lol.   It happened more than once on my 2005 Grand Caravan.   I fixed it once, and it came back.   I ignored the noise, and it did eventually start throwing misfire codes.

Both times the plugs were hand tight.  I didn't even need tools to remove them.   The second time it happened was right after I replaced the plugs and wires.",chrysler
That looks unfamiliar also burnt as hell. But there is a service bulletin which is also a recall on some Chryslers. Where the fuel pump relay won‚Äôt work through the fuse box and you have to install an external directly,chrysler
The car fixed its self ü§£üòÇ,chrysler
Contact the selling dealer and check with them. Could the socket be in the trunk with the jack or somewhere else in the vehicle?,chrysler
Are you looking at 4 adults? 2 adults 2 kids? For 4 adults I'd say it would be tight because of the convertible top mechanism the back seat is narrower than the coupe. I've owned both a coupe and convertible.,chrysler

"The only way to know for sure would be to connect it to a known good radio. But, if you pull the radio out and the antennae is connected to the back still, there's a really good chance it will be internal to the radio. I'm not sure if independent shops will have them, but a Chrysler dealer has a special tool for testing them",chrysler
"Late response but I personally own a 2010 with the 2.4L. It's been fairly reliable with fluid changes. I've beat the crap out of the car mechanically, used it as a construction work vehicle, sent it down dirt roads and taken it on long road trips. Took it from 100k to 300k miles.

"Thanks be to God the car is fixed! Not sure if they did what we paid for, but they did something to stop the issue. It may be they charged us for replacement of the catalytic to only clean it because we paid to have  the catalytic converters replaced, but it still had the same issue. We had to take it back to the mechanic, once they fixed the issue, the boss called and said it was an/the exhaust valve, but the mechanic said they just cleaned the catalytic converter. Stating that when they replaced it there was still some debris left behind.",chrysler
Ok. Without further scan tool data it's sounding like there might be a problem with the TCC circuit. That  would be the torque converter clutch.,chrysler
"There is no light on anymore. Essentially the car is said to be showing perfect condition and yet shaking/stopping when slowing down. We‚Äôre honestly discouraged, because each mechanics we find, one day it‚Äôs ok but the next they ditch us. The codes/what the paper said was the most likely solutions when we took it to an auto part before the very last mechanic fixed the temperature sensor was: catalytic converter and flange gasket. The test results were: Power train system ‚Äî P0420 & P0430-catalyst system below threshold bank 1&2; P0128-thermostat rationality. Anti-lock system‚ÄîU0100-00 - Lost Communication with ECM/PCM; U0101-00 - Lost Communication with TCM; C212A-16- System voltage below threshold- circuit voltage below threshold; C1246-1C-Vacuum Pressure sensor supply-circuit voltage out of range; U0401-00- implausible data received from ECM/PCM; U0125-00-Lost communication with dynamics sensor; C212A-17-System Voltage - Circuit Voltage Above Threshold. The mechanic did his own test and fixed the sensor and he said the catalytic code is gone & that there is no more issues, but the car did the same thing right after we left. Now we‚Äôre about to take to a place for transmission & hopefully they are honest and say what it is. I‚Äôm thinking for them to fix the small possible issues first & then see if it works, but no we were told transmission left and right so that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to check. I‚Äôm over here thinking all types of things, like maybe the battery‚Äôs charge is not where it‚Äôs supposed to be, maybe it‚Äôs EGR valve (because I see online some people had this problem with an older version of this car that even the dealer didn‚Äôt find, but that was the fix for most,) pcv valve, immobilizer, throttle body, loose wire in the PCM, etc., but I don‚Äôt know. The transmission was already rebuilt maybe a year and a half ago & and taken back again for the warranty, & now we‚Äôre gonna take it back to see, but now with no warranty.",chrysler

I'm not sure. I don't think they'd be connected. I'd do the easy blower motor fix and see if that addresses the rear.,chrysler
Smh take a 6 point 18 mm hammer it on and impact it off no problem,chrysler
Thank you. Do you know if the P0128 was repaired? That would be most likely a thermostat issue. In some cases the coolant temp sensor would cause this DTC. That would be the first step. Making sure the engine is running at the proper temperature.,chrysler

"Ok. Thanks for the reply.  I've worked on several PT Cruisers throughout the years and each one seemed to have it's own unique problem. One thing I would check for is an overheating catalytic converter. That in itself would account for a loss of power. I recommend 2 things:
1. Remove both O2 sensors and drive the vehicle. See if there is any improvement in driveability. 

2. Leave the sensors in place and just disconnect both connectors and check for improvement in driveability. Of course the Check Engine light will come on with the sensors disconnected or completely removed. But this should at least give you clues as to what might be happening. Keep me posted and I'm more than happy to help.",chrysler
"Most dealers will not rebuild a transmission, parts for a 62TE are likely on back order as well. Being it‚Äôs a 2016 you are out of manufacturer warranty so you will most likely be paying for a transmission or valve body. Unless you get lucky and something else is going on.",chrysler

"There isn't much.   To be honest, the Transmissions weren't really up to much performance uplift 20 years ago, and I'm sure it won't be any better today.

I had a 01' LHS, loved the car.  Miss it really.  A drop in K&N is going to do as much as anything.    IIRC, there is a baffle on the stock intake you can remove.   It's inline from the stock airbox to the intake manifold, kind of looks like a second airbox.  If you remove it, just cap off the place it connects to the air tube, and you get a little sound boost at wide open throttle.

There is really no off the shelf mods available for these cars.  There was a community of owners back then that dabbled quite a bit.   Look for stuff related to the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde, or 300M.   They're all the same car, just different body panels.   Searching for the Dodge Intrepid will get you the most results.",chrysler

"Trying to figure out what

>my can of a shifting hard

means.  
   
I'm guessing your transmission isn't shifting smoothly and you're asking for pointers.  My first question is how many miles are on the car.  Second, when was the last transmission service (fluid and filter change)?  
   
Contrary to bad marketing, the transmissions do need regular service.  Being a 2011, it should be a 62TE transmission.  Roughly, it should be serviced before 100,000 miles, and I would argue every 25,000-30,000 after that.   If it's been WAY longer than that without any service, then you're probably looking at a new transmission pretty soon.  You could try to change the fluid and filter (don't do a full flush) to buy some time, but it's just as likely that a fluid change may accelerate the problems too.",chrysler

A $3500- turbo kit by Turbosmart which isn't a top tier brand but one I've never had issues with is a good bet. You would gain to almost 600hp with 8 boost, almost 700 with 10. 
Don't bump up engines the cost will be at least double. Even the weakest part of the hemi which is the cast heads can handle 600+ easy before any issues or replacement needs.

My wife is from a Toyota family and she had a Corolla when we got married. I called it the Rolls Canardly, rolls down one hill and can hardly get up the next. It was such a turd of a car; would barely go, had to turn off a/c to accelerate, doors were thin, it was noisy, etc. We quickly dumped that and got her the 300. Her mind was blown and she was embarrassed to drive it at first because it was, in her words, ""so luxurious"".  She was like ""I can actually pass people now!"" 

We have had the same 300 for 16 years (which is still under full warranty, btw) while my father-on-law is on his 3rd Prius. At around 50k miles, the maintenance gets too costly, so he gets a new one.

"You can attempt to utilize some form of anti-slip/congealing agent like Lucas or BG, but the 62TE is notorious for burning up. I am not sure the condition of your automobile or driving habits, though I would recommend trying the additive approach after draining the system and replacing the filter on the bottom of the transmission pan. There is a solid chance that, no matter where you go, they‚Äôll try to throw a swap at you instead of a rebuild - the FCA kits for these transmissions are hard to come by, namely because they‚Äôre utilized in commercial/fleet programs like Amazon and or Safelite, so the demand usually goes to the companies for prioritizing asset distribution.

"What vehicle?  Year/model?

P0420/P0430 means the oxygen sensor after the catalytic converter is detecting a higher fluctuation in the exhaust gas concentration than normal.  Typically, exhaust after the catalytic converter should remain a LOT more consistent than the sensors before the Cats (yes plural. Some models have separate Cats for each cylinder bank). If the O2 sensor after the cat detects fluctuations too similar to the one before the Cat, then it throws the corresponding code.  
 
This COULD mean that the O2 sensor needs to be replaced, but likely means that the Catalytic converter is not functioning within expected parameters.  
 
What I would do is just clear the code and see if it comes back (and how long until it comes back). Otherwise could have been that the conditions were just right to trip the code during the last test cycle and it won‚Äôt come back for a long time. If it comes back soon, I‚Äôd change the O2 sensor (hoping it‚Äôs the sensor) as that is WAY cheaper than replacing the Cat.  If the code comes back again, then you might be looking at replacing that Catalytic converter. However, that would really only be a necessity if you‚Äôre in a state with emissions testing/inspections.  If you are in a state without inspections, you could just ignore it as that error will absolutely not affect any part of the operation of your vehicle.  It only indicates the exhaust is a little less ‚Äúclean‚Äù than it should be. 
 
There are some fuel additives that supposedly ‚Äúclean‚Äù the catalytic converter; but generally they are all ‚Äòsnake oil‚Äô so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend wasting money on those. 
 
You could also remove the car and run water through it to try to loosen and remove some of the carbon buildup that is reducing the efficiency. However, depending on the age of the vehicle, the exhaust parts may be rusted on and require WAY more effort to remove than it‚Äôs worth just to clear a code.  You might as well replace the Cat if you‚Äôre going to that much trouble.
 
One last thing that you might try is to take the car to an open road and just floor it a few times.  Getting the RPMs up high will increase the engine‚Äôs airflow, building up exhaust pressures that  MIGHT blow out some of the buildup in the exhaust system.  It might not do anything, but it also might do just enough to buy you some time so the code doesn‚Äôt come back for a while, allowing you to pass inspection (if your state requires it).",chrysler

"u/jon-wade, labor costs, especially on jobs as a radiator replacement, will usually exceed the costs of the part(s) (them)itself.  
  
If your radiator needs replacement, chances are your hoses are at least, if not, as old as your radiator.  
  
Therefor when you are doing such job, especially on a radiator replacement, it is absolutely necessary you also have ALL the hoses on your cooling system replaced as well.  
  
Failure to do so will only ended up costing you more in the long run, as in most cases, if you skip their (hoses) replacement, shortly after you have the new radiator installed, you will be back on the shop when they burst due to their age.  
  
Also, refain from using ANY mechanic/shop that wants to skimp/bypass their replacement to 'save' costs. Such 'savings' will ended up costing you more in the long run.  
  
Last but not least, you can save yourself the installation costs, by installing the radiator yourself. I'm not mechanic and I've replaced the radiator in some of my GM vehicles myself (as well as heater cores, which in some cases require an entire dash removal).

"Then, probably?   It's a 20 year old engine that was notorious for blowing up in the first year.    Plenty of them blew at under 50k miles.   It was almost always a coolant in the oil issue from the timing chain driven water pump.

As for the front, the blower motor is out on your front HVAC unit. These are very easy to change. The reason air still flows in fresh air mode is because of ram aim pressure when the car is moving. I'm not sure if the resistor of the motor is the culprit, but both are easy fixes.",chrysler

You should have no issues at all. The ECM will monitor and make the necessary adjustments by looking at the O2 sensors. Fuel composition sensors are also used on certain vehicles.,chrysler
Your PO123 is for the trouble with the throttle pedal sensor or switch high input your other code is PO420 is emissions from the cat converter o2 sensors are bad there is 1 for upstream and 1 downstream hope this helps you. Good luck,chrysler

"A bad catalytic converter would make for poor emissions from the exhaust as it fails to burn off the pollutants. This will lead to engine codes (p0420 and p0430, I believe), but shouldn't do anything to the actual engine operation.  The engine and everything else should still run perfectly fine, even with the engine codes.

If one of the cats is completely clogged, then the back pressure could cause other issues, but that's not too likely.  Find a clear road, floor it and let the wide open throttle and high RPMs blow out the exhaust system.  It's not a long term solution, but should get enough airflow back to run decent for a while.  Of course, this assumes that any restriction in exhaust airflow is even the problem.

If you're talking about it starting and then turning itself off right away, it's 99.9% not the catalytic converter.  The catalytic converters haven't even had time to heat up at that point.",chrysler

"It took fixing two issues to get our 2012 to stop shaking. 1. Left cylinder head recall repair. 2. Fuel pump switch repair (TIPM).  It‚Äôs been a while so I cannot remember which order these were addressed in. 

Not sure about all you are dealing with but we had a lot of shaking and there was a recall on the even cylinders head by Chrysler.  See below what I googled!  Our dealer was a pain in the rear to get them to do the leak check draw down at no charge because our was not throwing a code or miss firing enough. I had to find the actual letter to show them the recall notices does not require any certain level of miss firing or code and they are supposed to do the test free of charge if there is shaking. It was a whole ordeal with them.   Once they did the test it failed and they had to do the recall. I also paid to have them do spark plugs etc on the other side as well, since we were near 100k miles. 

[‚ÄúThis letter is to inform you that the warranty period (5 years or 100,000 kilometres) on the 3.6L engine left cylinder head on select vehicles has been extended to 10 years or 240,000 kilometres. does not experience this condition, then the left cylinder head is operating correctly and no repair is necessary.‚Äù](https://www.chrysler.com/universal/webselfservice/pdf/ca_en/X56.pdf)

Also we had issues with multiple switches on our TIPM. The fuel pump switch was one. Not sure if there was a recall but back in 2020 our dealer wanted $1200 to replace it. I sent it to one of the TIPM circuit board repair places and they fixed all 6 of the common switches and shipped the TIPM back. It took about a week to ship and get back. 

Have not had any problems with shaking since. 

FYI, I also used E85 and the dealer told me multiple times my problem was E85 not the leaking head gasket or TIPM. I had to fight to get my $ back for the multiple diagnostic fees when regular gas did not fix any shaking issue and once I fixed the tipm and they the head cylinder the vehicle did not shake at all on e85.

Edit: Re-reading yours I am going to bet $$ that your shaking is the head cylinder. Mine never threw a code and my wife complained that it shook more at a stop than while driving. I‚Äôd take it to an actual dealership and make them do the check.

"I feel like we're missing something here. Did you renew your registration when it expired? What about your insurance?

I've never leased a car so I could be wrong, but my understanding is that you still need to renew it (assuming you're in NY do that [here](https://dmv.ny.gov/registration/how-renew-registration)) even if the dealership did it when you first leased it. Also, Chrysler Capital wouldn't provide car insurance, that's on you. So I'm not sure why Chrysler Capital would need to get involved. They keep the title, since they still own the vehicle, you're just renting while you lease it. If you buy it after the lease is up then you get the title.

"u/Inevitable-Might5637, Since I don't know where you are located on eastern europe, my best suggestion for you would be to reach out to the nearest Chrysler dealer/parts center and order the the part your vehicle.  
  
Just keep in mind that Stellantis, who is the owner of Chrysler is pretty bad at getting the parts in stock - but they are still to this date being produced.  
  
Also, repairing the Module is as easy as testing each of the coils.. you test them with a voltimeter, the one that that is dead you replace it with another one ... for that work you need very elementary soldering skills - there are youtube videos of people replacing those coils literally in less time that it will take you to read this reply.

"So I'm going to assume a few things on this, could be wrong but good guesses. The only Chrysler is the Pacifica and 300. The 300 is phased out, with very few sales remaining.

1) UConnect is hot trash. I don't care what they do, what version is an inconsistent piece of junk. This is an area that traditionally hurts Chrysler, but they are not alone. Probably numerous issues with that. (Applies to 300 and Pacifica)

2) Buckets of complaints about the ZF 9spd transmission in the Pacifica. The transmissions just shift weird and can be very harsh, I mean VERY. Nothing is wrong with them, they just are what they are. They are actually decent transmissions, pretty reliable just that goofy shifting. ZFs response was that Americans need to learn how to drive or something. 

Now I'm waiting for the hate about the 9spd transmission, how Chrysler transmissions are junk etc. The funny thing is a boatload of manufacturers use the same Transmission... Including the almighty Honda.",chrysler

"Agree re: 2026ish+. In fact it may be perfect, since EVs are stalling a bit in sales but they are definitely the future so the makers are committed. So the pricing will likely go down.

That said - I would also strongly consider a PHEV with \~50 miles on battery. I'm prepared to go full EV since I have the van and another gas vehicle, but really PHEV is great too since 80% of my driving fits in even the 30 mile range of the Pacifica Hybrid. You just lose some of the other benefits like the lower maintenance and complexity of a pure EV.",chrysler
"Like most modern vehicles, if properly cared for, the Town and Country will give you many trouble free miles. The highest mileage Town and Country I owned was 80k miles. It was in great shape and the only issue we had was the head restrains deployed because my wife yanked on them. This is a common issue in these vans as they age and the plastic gets brittle. We sold it to buy another Town and Country with a wheelchair conversion. The new to us van is just as reliable as the old one. The Town and Country is a great van with a lot of premium features without the premium price.

Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge get a lot of hate on here but the complaints about reliability don't match my personal experience. I currently have 2 Chryslers, a Dodge, and a Jeep of various years and mileage. They are all really good vehicles and are not the maintenance nightmare the internet would have you believe. One of my Chryslers and the Jeep are both over 15 years old and nearing 200k miles. They both drive like new, start right up, and have never left me stranded. They are old and high mileage, so some maintenance is expected. The Jeep was just in the shop to replace the a/c condenser.

It's an older car so depending on how it's been treated keep an eye on rubber seals and hoses. The back brakes are drum brakes so they  could be sealed shut to rust.

I would recommend burping (opening and closing) the filler outlet, the flapper, with a flat head screwdriver (can‚Äôt remember if FCA has a tool for it in the rear compartment) - do this like, ten times, and there should have successfully purged the filler system of any excess fuel vapors.
