"It's actually #2. I wrote a post on this BMW forum a while back while at a company function. I had a few drinks, and it didn't come out right. I took it down ASAP. Someone inboxes me saying if you don't mind being roasted, leave it up. It's funny how missing one word can throw everything off. Go figure. I'll consider proofreading in the future.

The trade number he gave me for the m550 was solid, and I got a chunk off msrp for the 760. Did I get screwed with 30k in depreciation? Yes. But did I get a car that I still love so much, does everything right, and makes me feel extremely special? Yes. It was a very emotion driven decision.",BMW
Very cool! Glad I could have provided value!,BMW
I bet you have a German mechanic in your area that's just as good if not better than a dealer.,BMW
"This is a new kind of delulu lol

&#x200B;

No the truth is BMWs are expensive too maintain and the reason why they drop heavily in price so fast is because as they get to the \*over 50k\* high mileage it must be discounted from the price. Theres so many hoses and rubber things to replace nowadays on them.  The same thing with all luxury cars with expensive parts. The only luxury car that does not depreciate much is **SURPRISE SURPRISE** Lexus because they are basically reliable Toyotas. 

&#x200B;

A BMW that does not depreciate much would be one with the low mileage. As you put mileage or go out of warranty , it plummets due to this\^",BMW

"650i with N62, purportedly one of the least reliable engines in history. I didn‚Äôt have to do any repairs, but my ownership window was narrow, from 38k miles to 49k miles, though about 2 years. It was absolutely trouble free in that period. I changed its oil once.

The plusses, very comfortable, very fast, and with very smooth power delivery.

Minuses, not very engaging to drive and isolated one from the road a bit too much even in sport mode, didn‚Äôt hide its weight well, and finally since I got a coupe, it was very impractical with a tiny trunk and tiny backseat, but still very heavy so no advantage came of it.",BMW

"I‚Äôm buying my 330 bc to lease another car at the current rates would be stupid. They‚Äôre essentially giving me the same car to lease just a newer model for $200 more per month plus $3k down. No fuckin way. I‚Äôd rather buy my lease now bc it has less than 10k miles on it. When the rates go down I plan to sell it and get a new lease at lower than today‚Äôs prices. And probably make some profit off my sale since it‚Äôll still have very low mileage. 

That salesman is just doing their job to get cars off the lot. They don‚Äôt give two shots about helping you make the best decision you can for yourself. They need to sell cars. And their techs and service team are usually morons who don‚Äôt even do the work right. So you‚Äôre better off finding a trustworthy place that works on euro cars that is not bmw dealer.",BMW

"Here's the turbo kit he runs. https://klmrace.com/product/bmw-m3-m4-s58-single-turbo-kit/

One of the cars running the kit ran 8.5xx @137 which is interesting to me. If the car had bad traction and spun a bunch, he wouldn't get the 150mph trap speed that they're getting on a full pass, since the track is shorter after you lose grip and momentum is down. I was actually at the same show yesterday and watched this car run. He picked it all up on the back half of the track. Several cars had traction issues. Just because it wasn't sorted that day, doesn't mean he's lying.",BMW

"Depends on a lot of different factors, how does it look underneath, how is the engine and transmission and so on.  Noticed the GR plates, if it has lived next to sea than you might have quite a bit of corrosion, although I don‚Äôt think it has been put through harsh cold and salty winter conditions, all the much.

"1.5 years ago I bought my (now former) CPO '20 m550i with 24k miles. It was fully loaded minus the -DHP and -ColdWeatherPack. Purchase price was 57k before tax/registration, and they shipped it across the country for me at no charge. So I think they are both fair deals. 

All G30's for the NA market are high quality German builds. I would not worry about ""electrical gremlins."" Your biggest concern would be the engine specifically. The rest of the drivetrain is overbuilt because it's meant to handle the power of the M5 since they are shared. I would buy the car that has a better maintenance history (regular 5k mile oil changes, transmission flush, brakes recently replaced). Not all maintenance is reported on CarFax so I would request any and all documentation from the selling dealers.

I said I wouldn't move from the F10 M5 to the F90 and I did. I did the same with the F85 and F95. Ill prob want to do the same once I drive the G90.

"I‚Äôve driven BMWs, Audis, Porches and Corvettes on track and Audis classically understeer.  I understand at limit dynamics and, while a great street car, the RS5 is not a great track car.  Shit, I own an F82 and it‚Äôs really not that good of a track car without some suspension mods (camber plates at least, but bushings, adjustable tie rods and coils helps a ton and make it damn good).

If you want a stop light racer or like to do pulls on the street the RS5 will edge out the M4.  The opposite is true on track.  Both are very good cars.

"You‚Äôll encounter that shit everywhere. Went to a Mercedes dealership and had them try to scam me essentially. Was emailed an online promotion regarding a vehicle (C43 AMG which is selling awfully anyways) and they tried everything in their power not to honor it. Moreover, when I was requesting a breakdown of the lease terms‚ÄîMF, RV, etc.‚Äîthey had to go to the finance manager at least twice to give me what I originally asked for. Then they tried to gaslight me on what those terms actually meant. Absolutely floored me, and then the salesperson had the audacity to run after me and tell me he would honor the figures I threw out when I walked out after dealing with their nonsense. That was the worst, but Audi felt like a good old fashioned shake down too. 

Point being, look at the car you want and go shopping elsewhere if you aren‚Äôt treated right. Also, the M340i is a reliable model and people are clamoring trying to get it to the point where my service dealer was asking to buy it out from me less than a year into my ownership because allocation is low as well. You‚Äôll be fine if you want to purchase it.",BMW

Buyout was 6k under fair market value and i would probably get more in a trade but my SO wants it and is selling her 10 year old fully paid for Acura so net cost for her is under 20k for a three year old Prestige Plus S Line still under warranty for another year with 4,500 miles on it.

The (X)7/4/m3/IX series has huge grilles, the 2/5 series kept it pretty normal and now a bit modified borrow from the E27? Have you got some spare parts you don‚Äôt want to throw out? At least the lineup had the same ideology, and all models were distinct BMW. Nowadays the only thing that tells you it‚Äôs one that it‚Äôs got kidney grilles.

"I have has the i7 for 6 months now. Love it so much!

If you have the executive lounge option, dealer will tell you that front all weather mats are not available (as the passenger seat folds to get the reclined rear seat). However, you can still buy them and they fit fine. You‚Äôll have to remove passenger seat mat when setting the full lounge position is all. Also set the 1, 2 memory options. I have 1 set as default upright position, 2 for comfort. For passenger seat, I have 1 set to be less room in the front as assistant, personal guard or whoever will occupy that and 2 set as comfort for when I‚Äôm driving with a friend or partner.

Mine doesnt have the theatre screen as 4G isnt as fast and not available on the highways all throughout so I use iPad. They sell its mount designed for its seat. So thats something you can explore.

I got the 22kW home charger for free, and in settings I have set max charge level to 80%. I only charge full capacity when using for inter city travel. PPF coating also recommended if you use it to travel a lot, however may not be necessary. In my country lots of gravel, torn down roads etc so I keep it for protection.

Then uhh, you can download the app and it has some added features like pre route planning, pre conditioning and all. My region isnt supported so I miss out on those but you can avail I imagine. You can set driver profiles as well and set complete colour them accordingly. Additionally assign keys to driver profile if you have 2 keys so it automatically sets the default features.

The speed boost paddle is fun. Gives a full power boost for 10s. Good for quick overtaking or just having fun I guess.

Also the panoramic roof, it doesnt open all the way on default button press. At least it doesnt for me so i gotta hold it or press double. Was hoping that when auto lights turn on at night it should open automatically as it looks nice at night. You can also turn off the kidney glow if you have that at daytime.

Happy driving, and the auto brake function takes some getting used to and can be very aggressive in unorganized traffic situations (my country lol) so just be careful for that. If you want to turn it off, fyi it requires turning off at each restart.",BMW

"Hello, anyone have any idea what this noise could be? My car (2013 335i F30, 102k miles) is making the same exact sound as the car in this video:

https://youtu.be/bACkW0TSVVs?si=rriHnmi_wn6vqbCq

Only happens in sport mode when I'm pressing fairly hard on the gas. If I had to guess I would say it starts to make the noise when the boost starts to build up and continues making the noise for a few seconds then goes away. My car doesn't make the noise for as long as the car in the video does. 

If I let off the gas when I start to hear the noise, it goes away. I usually notice it when driving the car within the first 20-30 minutes of turning it on. It usually goes away altogether after I've been driving it for a while. 

I brought my car into the dealer last week for a different issue and explained the noise to them. They did a full front to back inspection and found other things wrong, but nothing related to the noise.",BMW

I wanted a new car but ended up with a better, slightly used 2021 5 series because he figured that I had a wrong opinion about used vehicles. I wanted a new 3-4 series to avoid maintenance issues, which actually was a compromise because I only love 5 series. He even recommended not to buy an extra warranty right now because the car still has a manufacturer's new-car warranty for another year. If I want, I need to buy it only when the original expires.

Most of that bloat is just attention seeking ""look at me"" badges and spoilers, and other plastics that just weigh down your vehicle. You do understand the irony in that right?

I recently sat down at a BMW dealership and learned that lease vs finance numbers are very close. This states that lease plans are at its worst right now. I believe you possibly overpaid on your current lease and that‚Äôs why they can match it. Unless of course you are returning an X5M and are leasing a regular X5.,BMW

I would look at the following packages on one :

1) premium package 
2) m sport suspension 
3) Harmon kardon sound system 
4) driving assist package 


That should line up with what you want. If you want leather seats and not fake leather you will need to add the vernasca leather option which is around 1500$ more.

Secondly, you say the trade-in value is equal to payoff.

"The exact model is: 520d xdrive 5j51. üëÄ
I can see it was registered for the first time in April 2014, so almost exactly 10 years ago. 
It's been with a leasing company and as i can see in the portal, it's been out twice since they bought it.
So I would assume were talking 3-4 owners?

It comes with a service deal for the first year though and with it being a leasing car previously, I would expect it to have been regularly and probably serviced throughout it's lifetime so far. 
It has also passed the yearly check and service only 7 days ago.
I can do the basics, inc oilchange. 
Plus we'd not be driving every day. Couple of trips during the week, but mainly at the weekends for medium to long trips. From around anywhere between 50 to 300km a trip.

Total cost for the car, all inc. Would be just around 5.200$/‚Ç¨ but that's with the monthly insurance included for the first year. Car alone would be around 4300$/‚Ç¨
Which is why im interested in it. It's cheap for a nice family car.
The state is also very good. Clean, no scratches, dings or dents. And if I need to change it in a year, financially it is not something that will ruin the family.

"Debuting alongside the RS5 DTM in Geneva, the RS5 Coupe comes with a 2.9-liter biturbo engine, also used in the Porsche Panamera 4S. With one little exception ‚Äì it‚Äôs even more powerful now at 450 horsepower (336 kilowatts). What‚Äôs even more impressive, it represents a major improvement in torque over its predecessor ‚Äì rated at 442 pound-feet (600 Newton meters), the new motor has 125 lb-ft (170 Nm) more than before.

https://www.motor1.com/news/138149/audi-rs5-geneva-debut/

From a practical standpoint, it is effectively the same engine. Interestingly, the Panamera has been slightly detuned in terms of power and torque. When examining the power/torque figures, the Panamera produces 440 horsepower/405 lb-ft, while the RS5 possesses 444 horsepower/443 lb-ft. In the Panamera, it is paired with Porsche's dual clutch transmission. Therefore, the lower torque likely results from the transmission. The transmission will impart a unique character to the vehicle, and it is likely that Porsche performed their own throttle mapping and engine mapping. I have never driven a Panamera, but common complaints from current Audis are throttle lag and a sluggish transmission unless you drive in Sport mode constantly. I envisage that the mapping in the Panamera possesses greater responsiveness. Regarding the financial aspect, Porsche possesses substantial margins. This is not an achievement of the least value as they are one of the most profitable car manufacturers. The Panamera represents a larger vehicle, and some may argue that its handling capabilities surpass those of Porsche.",BMW

"2013 3GT owner here - it's an amazing car and so far, my favorite that I've daily driven. Currently sitting at 205k KM. It's EXTREMELY spacious inside, both trunk and leg room. The car does feel rather wide while driving it, but it's something you get used to, otherwise it's on par with the average sedan dimensions, maybe slightly wider. The overall feature set is great and I honestly can't find anything I'd be missing, maybe a rear parking camera, but that really depends on how well you can reverse/park, it's been no issue for me, especially since the car has both front and back sensors. 2014+ models will feel even better as far as the feature set goes. I'm in a similar situation as you, we got this car with my girlfriend mostly to travel and it's been great.

Driving it is great, I enjoy comfort mode in city and sport on anything that goes above 70km/h. The car does include automatic spoiler, which is a neat feature. Fuel consumption is just about what you'd expect (I have diesel) and it's around 6.5l/100km combined. Around 5.5-ish in the city. Feel free to hit me up with any questions about it!

Personally, it's one of my most favorite BMWs as far as visuals go, but from what I understand, most BMW fans generally think that they're ugly. I say fuck them lol. I have the estoril blue and it's gorgeous. I also loathe wagons, so, this car has been a godsent as far as space and looks go.",BMW

It's always good to know as much as possible about a car before putting any kind of money in, definitely. That being said, what were you expecting? Any engine built by any manufacturer will require some kind of servicing and maintenance at some point during its life. You will never buy a car and not spend a dime on it throughout it's existence.

Of course does not have the power of the S58 as its the engine that paved the way for the S58 and sure needs a bit more stuff to make S58 power but saying that it does not make the S58 power is a bit silly, plenty of over 1000hp S55s out there. Its pretty much agreed that the S55 is a very fun engine, more fun than the S58, the S58 makes tons of power ok great, its not all about that. Not to. mention the S55 is paired with a much better auto transmission. S55 power band is actually pretty nice, very little turbo lag, mimics NA very well. As far as sound it sounds fine, blown out of porportion imo, also people act like the S58 sounds like an F40, its fine but its not great if you compare it to BMWs great S65. To be fair non of the other M cars really sounded that great but the E9x, one could argue the E46 sounds good but its raspy just like the S55.  I don't even have a car with a S55 anymore but when I had my M2 (as of just last week), it was one of the greats, great car, great engine.",BMW

"The Audi looks better and is prob a better car overall. But the M4 will undoubtedly be way more fun to drive. The random oil leaks and coolant leaks will prob be neck & neck. So I‚Äôd guess your out of warranty maintenance cost would prob be similar. 

The Audi gets edge because it‚Äôs a bit longer and less round. The M4 should be a bit more flat looking at its length. Or retain its roundness and be a little longer. But that would make it the 8 series. And we know the  8 series is supposed to look better the 4 series. 

I also prefer the longer coupes ie CL500, S class coupe, 650i, DB9. But those are significantly different cars for different market segments, so I don‚Äôt think this comparison is fair.",BMW

M5 will definitely be more lux but I don‚Äôt know if I would want to take such a large heavy beast on a track.  Even the G80 is a porker compared to the F80.  The cost of brakes on these cars is $$$$ and the heavier the car the sooner you need to replace them.",BMW

1. You don't have turn signal lights, don't even try to use them.
2. Take a minimum of two parking spots anywhere you so the poors don't swing their doors open to damage your beautiful paint.
3. Headlights are high beams only.
4. You may not need to go fast, but you should always aim for at least 20mph (32kmh) over any given ""speed limit"" sign.
5. Do not go around people in traffic. It‚Äôs seen as weakness. Simply blind them with rule 3 until they move over. This properly asserts dominance.

"2014 is the LCI, so it should be the B47 engine (rather than the N47). I would reconfirm with the dealer though; the N47 engines were problematic (esp timing chain), while most of the problems were fixed in the B47.

How many owners had this car? If its on the low side (1-2) with the previous owners keeping it for long periods, its a good sign regular maintenance was done. If that is the case, this car has loads of life left.

Its always a risk to buy with that high mileage, especially with a large amount of previous owners. 

If its a very good deal, try to get good warranty from the dealer.

"Yup I am fully aware of the pre refresh models still sitting, which is partly why I want to go for it . The dealers that have the color combo I want don't want to move on their pricing , despite sitting on new models too and having to ""bump"" their new models down to cpo models by trading it between their sister dealerships in order to receive 24 allocations.

I was going to close on a great deal from Paragon Acura for a 23 with only 1.2k miles for 46.5k pre tax but it sold literally the day before I could go in to finalize the deal. Can't find any like that with such good price to milage ratio and maximum warranty length.

Also if you are sure that the specific unit m340i has been sitting for so long , I'd try and make a case for bargaining a few thousand off at least if it meets your requirements, but as I have learned early on , especially with such an expensive purchase , is that you don't settle for missing features / specifications.",BMW

After that you have the floors and and body panels etc. 

You still have to understand what state the engine/gearbox is in and then electrics etc. It's not a complicated electrical system but it's still work.

"The sales person is an idiot.

The m340i is literally one of the most reliable vehicles you can buy in todays selection of luxury sport sedans lol. There‚Äôs a reason why Toyota (we obviously know is known for reliability) worked with them to pretty much make 90% of the Supra from BMW components including the B58. It‚Äôs literally a 2-door m340i. Easy to work on, easy todo your own oil changes and all other maintenance. He‚Äôs just trying to sell you something else that requires you to finance so they get more money.",BMW
"Combination of things. I won't lie and say I've built 1000hp B58/S58's. I've done some  mild work, and gotten them to over 500's. Which is considered mild believe it or not. 

That said, what makes these engines special, is that they can be taken there *with less*, vs a typical turbo charged engine. Keeping it in the BMW family, lets that the previous generation engine: the N55/S55. If you want to get there in power, you're going to have to do significant work. You're going to have to rework the internals, the cylinder head. Upgrade the turbo, fuel system, and injection system. It's Frankenstein work. 

But the B58/S58? They have been taken to those levels with stock internals, stock turbo(s), just mild reworking of the cylinder heads, intake, exhaust, and injection system and remapping of the fuel system. Supposedly, even the stock fuel pumps can handle north of 700hp.

That's why these engines are beloved by the community. It's the MKIV Toyota Supra of this generation.",BMW

Humans have a baggage when they judge aesthetics, it's what we are used to seeing, what is the contemporary aesthetics, their culture and... biology.

Brain loves patterns and when things look like they are there for a reason, lines connecting etc., and doesn't like others. If you look at any single thing or being, you should be able to say if you like it or no, and what specifically is it for you that makes you say so.

New 5 series is a mess of a design, with its lack of harmony, random lines and angles where they have no purpose, funky proportions, where nothing connects. It's just an ugly car for no.

Do you want a manual/DSG and RWD

OR

Standard Auto and AWD.

Performance, looks, luxury, price and reliability are all more or less equal. Decide how you are going to use your vehicle and that should justify your choice.

Personally for me as a car enthusiast growing up in the 90s and 2000's manual transmission and RWD are symbolic to performance sporty vehicles. So I went with the M4 DSG. 

I test drove the DSG and was floored by how aggressive and realistic the transmission felt. I rolled off the throttle while vehicle was in second gear, manual mode at 5000rpm and the engine braking I felt in that instance was intense. My head literally snapped forward. The DSG in the f series Ms is world class, super fast, super aggressive and all the shift parts one can possibly wish for lol.",BMW

"Slanting it that way also allows more room for a large and efficiently designed intake manifold which they definitely took advantage of even in the early days with the M10 M20 & M30, similarly it makes for less severe turns and sharp angles in the exhaust since it‚Äôs already facing slightly downward.

"Would you charge an AGM battery using a low-powered 'dumb' trickle charger designed for flooded batteries? I need to get my battery charge up as the car has given me a warning. However, I only have an old 'dumb' trickle charger that outputs **12V 1.0A** and am also in a bit of a bind as I have to move my car (details below) from winter storage four hours back to its main location; so don't have my typical equipment or retail-access.

I understand the main problem charging AGM batteries with conventional flooded battery chargers is that the charger [can output more volts than the 14.4V](https://ccar-greenlink.org/agm-batteries-never-use-conventional-chargers/#:~:text=Using%20a%20conventional%20battery%20charger%20on%20an,(ever) max for which AGM batteries are rated. However, I think I'll be okay since:

1. The charger I'm using is so low-powered (12V 1.0A shouldn't get above the 14.4V rated max)
2. I'm not looking to fully charge up the battery but just bring it to 'use-able' before taking a 4 hour highway trip (where the battery will hopefully charge up the rest of the way)
3. I'll be watching the voltage on the battery and can disconnect if it goes too high

I would ask for a price if it for some crazy reason wouldn't be covered by warranty so you know what you might be getting into before starting. Explain clearly to the service advisor that the leak ONLY happens after prolonged use of the AC and not any other time, the issue with this is sometimes mold could grow under the carpet which in of itself is expensive, if the case, this must be replaced under warranty and no labor time must be reflected on the customer, make them aware of this.

Leasing new cars every 3-5 years is just a waste of money. Worst case scenario buy the car out first, if you have your eyes on some other cars, trade it in then!",BMW

my dad; who is the most detail orientated pain the ass person on the fabric of this universe, said;

""her engine sounds like a brand new watch""
""tiktiktiktik""

and it has proven itself worthy of all my love.

i plan, to ride her until her engine breaks, and when it does, if it comes to the point that i can't repair her, i will drop a brand new engine in her and do it all over again.

i wouldnt let the dealers grubby, sweaty, gluttunous hands get on my babygirl,

i change her tires, i change her brakes, i change her intake, oil, tranny fluid, i wash her with my hands, and she gets me home safe and sound.

1) keeps your cars away from others, make it easier to keep the car free from door dings.

2) since youre walking further, youre burning more calories and staying healthier by doing exercise that you otherwise wouldnt.

"> I don't understand the point of convertibles on a fundamental level

Feeling the breeze and sun on my face and in the cabin is enjoyable. Being able to get extra light is great. Smelling pine trees and hearing birds chirp on a cold fall morning drive through the forest is calming. 

[Henry Catchpole](https://youtu.be/RqRFEOUufDU?t=72) explains it better than I do.

> Driving with the roof down is something that I've always loved. It just, I dunno, it really does add to the experience. It makes a journey more four-dimensional, somehow. Driving down a beautiful road like this - and it is a beautiful road - you get more in touch with the landscape. For a start, there are all the smells, that sort of warm, heady, heavy smell of all the bracken at this time of year.

To your other point:

BMW‚Äôs instrument panel was really one of their strongest traits. Good looking, but simple enough that the overall design remained consistent from generation to generation.

They could‚Äôve easily brought this design digital if they really wanted to, as evident by how Porsche managed to do it with theirs.

Nobody is gatekeeping.  It‚Äôs not a baby M3.  These cars feel so different.  I‚Äôve driven both.,BMW
"Drive them both. I can tell you from experience, that the m4 is pretty harsh and stiff on the road and the interior quality is shit. I also found it boring to drive on the road because of the speed limits; the car is always pushing you for more beans.

The s55 is hard to make sound good and I feel it's out of place in the m4 like a dinosaur. However, in an m2 comp, it's the best car I've ever driven. I'd much rather be in an m2 comp.

I've only driven an S5 Prestige, and the interior was way nicer! The ride was soft and it was plenty of power, but not overwhelming that you feel the need to speed. Maintenance seems scarier to me on Audis though.

These are just my 2 cents.",BMW

"6 series F06 is one of the best modern BMW designs. Best years for the F06 are 2016+ as they received the interior and iDrive refresh.

I can assure you of that. I purchased my 1990 M20 i6 325i Coupe, late model for $10k like three years ago. I‚Äôve had offers for $20-$25k already. No, I have not sold it. Yes, it‚Äôs mint.",BMW

The answer is mostly that a BMW weighs a lot more than just its engine. The cylinder head being off to the side is some 50-75lbs (effectively) shifted a few inches to the right, but it's not SUCH a big deal that you can't compensate for it by moving ancillaries like the 40-70lb battery that goes either under the rear seats or on one side of the trunk.

You can see in a comparison of I6 and V8 in the same chassis that BMW I6 cars are generally designed around LHD. https://www.m5board.com/threads/m5-corner-weights.485321/",BMW

That‚Äôs it. 4 years and 2 issues that were resolved quickly by my BMW mechanic that my family has gone to for 15 years at this point.

"In addition to the big ones that others have mentioned (e.g. lack of buttons, double widescreen, e-brakes) I lament the ""features"" that truly took away the soul of the ultimate driving machine:

EPAS (these guys just can't get it right, unlike Porsche, neutering the drive feel which is kinda....everything we look for in BMW), turbos everything (NA inline 6 made BMW, speed is not everything, B58 is not the second coming of Jesus), electronic oil monitor/no dipstick, ZF everything instead of DCT and the diminishing manuals, distinctive interior design (Mini's X1, X2, that ridiculous 2GCs, indistinguishable from 5s and 7s?), cast wheels instead of forged (ok i'm nitpicking but I've seen plenty of new BMW cast wheels fails on youtube)

Here's another increasingly common feature: M on everything.",BMW

"I would buy it out unless you are planing on downgrading, keep in mind that you know the history and how its been taken care of, that car will be the bestchoise if considering all other cars that are similar year and mileage and such.

""They're reliable cars but I wouldn't be caught dead without an extended warranty"" even though I work for the dealership. Extended warranties & maintenance plans are the keys to owning the cars in a cost efficient way. Even if you don't have a maintenance plan.. you don't have an M car so the service isn't crazy expensive.

Im the past I had a F11 535d touring with a very sweet 6cylinder. Very good car that was, but a G31 540 was an additional 16k on the price of the 520 hence pushing it to ‚Ç¨92k.. I found that a bit to much",BMW

"These are also good points as well.

This should have been obvious to be but, I had the broader picture in mind. The intake being more complex has more room on the upside slant for the parts/hardware needed.

"I bought a 22 LCI M40 used as my goodbye to ICE automobiles. The 22 MY is a great place to stop and hold. Anything newer is not better, just different. In 5 years time the electric vehicle landscape will have evolved to be more compelling than just Tesla or unproven competition.  It will make sense to switch then. Buying a 24 or 25 MY now cuts you off from what‚Äôs maturing now.",BMW
"It's salvageable. It's a lot of trouble potentially because likely there is a lot of rust and in many places.

And then there is the interior to worry about. A BMW 2002 isn't a very valuable car but if properly restored, it can be around \~20k EUR. As you're in Greece, if you have friends/relatives who can do a lot of the work, or you can do a lot yourself then it can make sense if you want to sell it. 

If you want to own it, drive it and not sell it, then the value is whatever you decide it is for you. As a Cypriot BMW-man myself, I'd pick a different BMW to restore unless this BMW had sentimental value.",BMW
