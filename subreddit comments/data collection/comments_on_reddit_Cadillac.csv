"Hey... I am that regard. But yes, a whole lot of the luxury car market is centered around people trading in cars every 2 years for the new model. I would actually say more than half of all new luxury cars will not be owned by the original purchaser within 3 years",Cadillac

Trifecta tune. They ship you the cable and you download the file and install on your car. Takes 10 minutes and it's a big difference.,Cadillac
"Replace switches, if still broken, remove inner door panel and poke around.",Cadillac
"Tint, chamge the chrome mirrors and personally, do something with the grille. Whether you black ir out or tey and colour match it (I have an 07 CTS sport with the paint matched slotted grille and chrome mesh underneath, I like it gar more than any other grille/front end setup on the first and second gen CTS). Oh yeah and get rid of the black gas cover, it just seems out of place for a daily driver.",Cadillac
I don't care what gm recommends. I follow science. Oil test at first 500 miles vs subsequent oil changes shows much higher wear metals. You can check yourself next time you buy a new car.,Cadillac

"It's a TBI 5.7, not the LT1. 

LT1 didn't start until 1994, beautiful car though, it should sell pretty quickly.",Cadillac
Agreed,Cadillac
"People want the cars behind the Buick name.  People just don‚Äôt want the Buick name.  GM should fire everyone in their Name department.  Shit, Ford renamed the Escape to Bronco and look at the sales on that this.  Rename the Malibu to just ‚ÄúM‚Äù and sales would increase",Cadillac
Boring,Cadillac

"I get them from Amazon.  This is the 4th set.  I got my grill from Savage Cadillac! The puddle lights are $29.  You get 2, so if you have a four-door and want them on all doors, you will have to buy two sets.",Cadillac

I had a 2018 I believe and I loved it. ATS are great.,Cadillac
"Check the motor mounts. They are a common issue on these cars. I replaced both motor mounts and the transmission mount to cure my vibrations at idle. My 2011 CTS only has 55,000 miles, but they were shot.",Cadillac
Yup,Cadillac
"Nice, got my 2015 ATS 2.0T recently and have been thoroughly enjoying it. It‚Äôs my first luxury car so it‚Äôs an experience. Everything from materials used to how solid it feels is so much better than a basic car.",Cadillac

"Something tells me you haven‚Äôt even bothered looking at both engine bays.

"Explain please, how being a higher risk driver through verifiable data leading to you paying more, and drivers with less risk paying less is ""the downfall of nations""?

"While it is something I would never purchase, it is reminiscent of the super luxurious stage coaches and train cars of times past. Everything was completely bespoke, and everything used to feel extremely special because of it.  If Cadillac can capture \*that\* feeling in the Celestiq experience, maybe it would help to justify the price tag.  But if it's going to be the usual GM and Cadillac treatment, this is guaranteed to be another dud.  A glorified replacement to the ELR, unless they do something drastic and new",Cadillac
My 2.0 turbo 2015 is getting 10.3 liters per 100 km thats roughly 27.7 miles to the gallon. Ill take that all day long.,Cadillac

Hahaha the 3.6 doesn‚Äôt have 310 dumbass. It‚Äôs 302 and it only has 272 ft lbs tq vs the v8 315. You don‚Äôt know what you are talking about. Keeping trying to convince yourself your shitty 3.6 poverty spec is good. You beat a guy in a race that wasn‚Äôt even trying‚Ä¶. Good job‚Ä¶,Cadillac
"Yes they should :/ , going to do more research on hydrogen hybrid swap for better fuel efficiency",Cadillac
"I agree with /u/Admirable_Nothing about the proximity sensors.  My prior '18 WRX STI cost $35k less and had that feature.  The door buttons seem cheesy. 

I also wish they would do adaptive cruise with the manual.  I get that it could not be as flexible as with an auto,  but they could just program it to disengage if the RPMs got too low or high. I don't need to do a morning commute with it,  but it would be nice out on the open highway.

I'd also like a less ""blingy"" display option for the digital dash.  Still,  it's way better than some of the horrendous stuff I see on other cars.

For the money I wish the interior had a more premium look.  I saw a CT4 trim at my dealer with a two-tone dashboard that I think looked great. I would love that color scheme - but with the sports seats. 

But those are quibbles.  The car is fantastic.  The purchase was a legit bucket list item for me.",Cadillac
Caddy porn approved.,Cadillac
"CarsAndBids.com

"All the bearing hub assemblies are the same ‚Äî w/ the tone ring embedded on the inner side, in order to communicate w/ the speed sensor. The speed sensor sets into a cowling surrounding the axle boot and operates independently of the tone ring.",Cadillac

They're Cadillac wheels from the GM store. Came in chrome only 2014-2019. Re-released as black wheel in 2021 as individual purchase only. Something like that.

It‚Äôs an EV. No interest whatsoever.,Cadillac

"003 isn't a check engine  light code.
It's usually a P√ó√ó√ó√ó code..

If it were A P0003 code points to a fuel pressure regulator., could be as simple as a vac leak.


Did they clear the code? Has it come back on?",Cadillac
"I stopped at the dealer.  My car was in the service lot.  I talked to the service people, and they had a surprise look on their face.  The car was parked by the service exit and they got many comments on it.  They wanted to know who called but I couldn't remember.  They also said the car was never in the body shop and hasn't moved.  It's scheduled to be checked tomorrow for the leak down.  The brakes are rusty so they are not going to feel the trans not engage.  I have little faith that they will be able to duplicate the problem.

I went to sales and asked if they had a V for sale.  They said they will check.  Not at the moment sir but we can find one.  I told them mine is in service and I'm not trading it in.  It only has 29k miles so I bet people were asking if it was for sale.  

I guess it was a case of a salesman trying to sell two cars and not knowing where the car was.  

If they don't fix it I'll fix it myself.  The parts are around $450. I'm going to cam, tune, and meth soon anyway.",Cadillac

"You also have to be ASE master certified to become World Class Tech for GM and it takes years to complete all the GM training for this achievement.

 In Michigan you have to have State Certifications which grants you your Mechanic license and your only legally allowed to perform work on the categories your certified in. I am a master certified tech. I work in the shop and run Roadsides. Why do I think roadside techs should be certified? Because if someone comes out to your vehicle and hooks up a jumpbox but that doesn't start the vehicle they have no idea where to go from there and more than likely submit for service failure, needs a tow.  Because I'm a seasoned tech. I can go a few steps further and 9 out of 10 I'm getting your car running again. 
Also those are just the basic minimum requirements for a Cadillac roadside tech. I swap out batteries pretty often, Perform global resets,  do quite a bit of electrical diag. And much more. 
 I just had an xt4 with a inop. brake position sensor and car wouldn't start, I was able to get enough contact inside of it clamping it together so that i could get it started and driving so she could get to the shop and get in a loaner right away.
 I Keep an MDI2 with me and a Windows Surface to pull codes to see whats going on and if there's something I can fix on the road to atleast get you driving home or to the shop so you don't have to wait another 2 hours for a tow truck to show up. There's so much more a Roadside tech. can do.",Cadillac

"I had a 2011 STS. Loved it. I couldn't keep it because it was too low to the ground. Suspension was shot, too. Couldn't afford to fix it and keep it.  But I loved it. My favorite car.

I love my DTS, too. But it's a different kind of love. The STS was the wild girlfriend that you had as a young man. The DTS is the girl you brought home to Mom.",Cadillac

"The old school way of breaking in a car was to drive the hell out of it.   I bought a 98 1LE Camaro with the new LS1 engine early and actually took delivery on Sept 5th of 97.   As the differential is relatively soft metal and one thing that definitely needs breaking in I made three separate 10 mile drives that evening separated by an hour of cool down time each.   The next morning I drove 100 miles to an autocross, where I worked and ran early making 5 runs in the 90 second range, winning my class.   Finishing about noon, I headed home and stopped at a local drag strip and made four 1/4 mile passes running in the high 12s at 106 mph each time.   After that I drove back home and stopped again on the way at a Dynojet facility and did some Dyno pulls, showing 314.6 rwhp on a car that was rated at 305 hp at the crank.   That car was great for its entire life.

Drive your car like you stole it and enjoy it.",Cadillac

I say get the vertical wings/wreth of the 1941 model it‚Äôs the most unique and least used Cadillac emblem I wish I had gotten that tattooed vs the traditional 1960‚Äôs-2000 emblem but I still like it but the other design is more unique than run of the mill designs üçª,Cadillac
Had a 77 CDV and then had a 79 SDV. Both great cars. Both had the 472BB Caddie. 77 blew head gaskets and then spun a bearing after the gaskets were replaced and was donated. The 79 blew the transmission and was also donated. I miss those old monsters.,Cadillac
You should be able to drive it for a while just not too long could make things even worse is you drive it for a couple thousand miles I have a 2013 and same thing happened took it to dealer for a trans flush and prob went away it‚Äôs been about 7 thousand miles and still running great,Cadillac
Worst car name ever. What were they thinking.,Cadillac
That backend is just trash. Not a fan of that design at all and I hope we don‚Äôt see that trend follow to their electric sedans. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the lyriqs backend either but it grew on me but this one is just awful.,Cadillac
100% what I was thinking,Cadillac

".Long story be short, I bought the car with a 175 point inspection from findlay cadillac in Henderson. I was treated like garbage by the whole staff during the whole purchase. Worst customer service I‚Äôve ever received. All dealerships in Nevada are required to come with a 30 day anything goes wrong warranty. Right when I DROVE off on the FIRST day the whole nav and ac buttons and everything else stopped working. Told them about it. They said it was the control module. They ordered one and said it didn‚Äôt fix the issue and they put in a custom Apple car play radio in it, which I love , and took out the old system and nav screen. They had it for 3 and a half weeks. Got the car back drove it for about 8 days maybe 150 miles, and then the check engine light came on. Took it to auto-zone got a purge valve code. Told Findlay Cadillac about it , they were very rude during the whole process and fixed it and said it was a loose fuel line. They were nice to my face only because they have to be, but I can sense the smirks on their face and the dirty looks. Now I‚Äôm outside of that 30 day warranty, as they took their time. After driving the car about 25 miles and having it back for a night and a day, took it to auto zone and it‚Äôs showing the p0003 code small evap leak per auto-zone. Findlay Cadillac in Henderson Nevada told me  that there was a gas line that was loose.  They said they fixed it. Called after going to auto-zone today , due to my suspicions, and it popped up with the p0003 code small evap system leak. Minutes after, I called the rude people at Findlay Cadillac, who have been unfriendly and rude throughout this whole process. Findlay Cadillac said that the system takes 100-300 miles to reset.  Autozone said there tool will pick up anything even before the car resets to 100-300 miles. Should I drive it 100-300 miles and see if the car has no lights on and ‚Äúresets‚Äù like cadillac told me and then take it back if there‚Äôs an issue?  I don‚Äôt know who to believe or trust anymore. I‚Äôve never had such a bad customer service experience in my life before purchasing this car from a dealership who is ‚Äúsupposed to be a reputable dealership.‚Äù I‚Äôm sick of all the back and forth with them. I just want to know what I should do at this time, and if I should get it checked elsewhere and file a BBB complaint against them due to this, or hold off and remain nice and see what they have to say. I‚Äôm sick of having to bring this car back possibly for the 3rd time, especially when the first issue took them 3 and a half weeks to fix, the second issue took two days which was fast , but a day and a night later having the same issue per autozone. Thanks",Cadillac
"I gotta comment again. The colorways of this car work so damn perfectly (perfect?). The gold rims with the red and black. Not just that they're gold, but the wheel style is perfect too. One word for this car- HARD. Love to see it, every time I do.",Cadillac

"I would start with the basic things. Change your intake filter. Clean your MAF and throttle body. Consider changing spark plugs and ignition coils. Depending on millage I would consider looking at o2 sensors becoming lazy. These are all just general tuneup items. 

When changing parts on these cars always go with oem. This doesn‚Äôt always mean GM Genuine or AC Delco as a lot of those parts are made by Bosch or Denso depending on the year as their suppliers flip flop a lot. 

Poor gas mileage can also point to vacuum leaks after the MAF. 

Get yourself a decent scan tool and learn o2 sensor patterns and what they mean. When you know what your looking at it provides so much insight into what your fuel and air is doing and will point you in the right direction for a proper diagnosis. 

Good luck my friend. Gen 2 CTS are great cars when you figure out their quirks",Cadillac

Wow.  I went through a similar thought process.

Before buying my 4BW,  the most I had spent on a car was $39k on an WRX STI.  I was always thinking I would buy a world class performance sedan in retirement.

In 2021 a friend a few years older than me died - about a year before he had planned to retire.  6 months later I ordered my Blackwing.  I don't recall thinking about it at the time,  but that friend's death was surely a factor in the YOLO attitude I had when I placed my order.",Cadillac

I have a CT4-V BW with the carbon fiber splitters and the manual calls for it to be towed on a flatbed and put on the flatbed by dollies.   Neither Cadillac nor AAA sent a flatbed but a normal hook.   The Cadillac tech was simply lost.   I did find a AAA shop that was willing to send his top guy and when he arrived he knew enough to have me grab the spring snubbers (I never knew what they were for but had kept them) and that got us an extra 5/8ths inch ground clearance up front so he could lift the back up a bit to get it out of the garage and he kept it to 35 mph all the way to the dealership so he didn't drag the CF splitter on the ground and destroy it.

"Can't go wrong with each other choice. My dad has had an XT5 for a few years and he takes small to medium boxes everyday to the UPS store. I recently got an XT4, upgrade from a Nissan. Apple CarPlay is my only complaint, it never works right, so I just Bluetooth my audio and phone old school - and no issues. Both my dad and I drive very low miles, so can't really report on any high mileage issues.   


XT5 feels a little wider in the inside than the XT4. When I first test drove an XT4 it felt smaller, but that went away quickly and it felt fine pretty quickly. XT4 is slightly noisier than the XT5, but that could be because of my 4 cylinder and my dad's 6 cylinder. Still quieter and smoother than the Nissan Altima I had before, so it doesn't bother me at all.

"Very great that your family had sense enough to keep it.  With the war situation it was a very great thing to have a brand new car of any brand going into the war.  I wish I knew what my grandfather saw leading him to know what kind of shortages were coming. In the fall of '41 he bought himself and my grandmother a new Oldsmobile and Buick the same day, and the most important thing they got was 10 new tires, as you weren't getting any more until the war ended.  The Buick had compound carburetion, which ultimately proved to be a huge albatross.  To even use the car they had to change the intake manifold, and downgrade the engine to a single-carb model because it would not start.  During the war, less fuel consumption was extremely attractive, not to mention not fouling the plugs the way the original setup did.  I've read where everyone who bought compound carburetion wished they hadn't, because the fault was in the manifold, and GM didn't do anything about it until the war ended.",Cadillac

"I've owned a 91 Deville with the 4.9, and two different Northstars, and was satisfied with all of them.  The 4.9 developed a leak that was covered under warranty, but I had no trouble with either of the Northstars.  I'm aware of others' having expensive troubles with the Northstar engine, and I sold mine before they got old and cranky.  I loved driving all of them, as they have enough power for the assigned work, and much of nothing anywhere had enough power during the 80's.  I would never have looked at a Cadillac if GM hadn't wrecked Oldsmobile by shrinking it, and taking it's power from under the hood.

When my 6-month insurance renewal paperwork would arrive, it would list the exact mileage of my 2014 Jeep Cherokee.  Jeep/Chrysler/Stellantis was obviously sending that mileage data, and probably other driving statistics, to Travelers.

"Actually now that I think of it...the lowest Cadillac has gone was to replace the CTS with the CT6 and then after three (4?) model years, discontinue it in NA, but continue to assemble and sell it in China.

Build it, and they will come, even for Cadillac isn't a strategy that sells in this day and age.",Cadillac

Stealerships are always hard up for trade ins. they will straight up cold call phone numbers from sales 2 years ago (new or used) and try to start a conversation about trade in. they even try to keep the payment the same (never mind the zillion extra months of payments!),Cadillac
Better question to ask is would it make a difference. Lots of posts over in the Cadillac forums about the modern GM intakes already being optimized for the setup. Couple guys were swapping CAI just to hear more turbo noise but I think anyone saw any gains with just a CAI and most still left the stock intake after a tune,Cadillac

"Very Cadillac. Long, low, ostentatious. I'm surprised (but shouldn't be) that fans of ""the old stuff"" hate it so much, it's the logical progression of old Cadillac overkill at a time when luxury buyers, at least, want electrics. Yeah, of course it looks unusual, it's a flagship design study that will be handbuilt for people with tons of cash who want something different, and choose Cadillac. Anyone hating on this is missing the point, and should be excited that the brand is even choosing to put out a vehicle like this. How is this not at least interesting?",Cadillac

If you want to chat with people about it, maybe check out /r/AskOldPeople/ .  A lot of people there willing to share their experiences.

From my perspective:  yeah,  we absolutely only live once.  But that doesn't mean beef your financial future by buying a $70k car.  

One of the best experiences of my life was a canoe trip through one of the most remote places in the The Lower 48.  

More car-related:  I'd long wanted a 4x4 vehicle,  but could not fit one into the budget until 5 years ago.  But two decades before being able to buy my own, I rented a Suzuki Samurai for a day in a beach town and explored a deserted part of the island.  It scratched the itch,  and for years afterwards the friend I had with me and I both recalled that trip fondly.  In fact,  on the 25th anniversary we went back to the same place in my own 4x4 truck.",Cadillac
I have blue on mine but could definitely see myself going yellow if I upgrade.,Cadillac

I have a CT6 with the 3.0TT as well. What I'm about to say will probably be very controversial on here but cold air intakes only make a difference on normally aspirated vehicles you will not notice any difference at all on a twin turbo. I went down the same rabbit hole when I first got mine. Truth is it's not a very mod friendly car but still awesome and fun to drive. I wanted to level the car out a little bit and lower the rear end but that causes issues with adaptive cruise control among other things. There's also a manufacturer that makes downpipes with cat delete these make the car sound pretty wicked but you're going to get an error code and a check engine light every couple hundred miles not worth it in my opinion. Then there's the option of tuning the factory computer you can get a little bit of gane doing this but I don't believe it's worth it in my opinion,Cadillac

You just have to be prompt with it, because the crankcase ventilation system isn't under as much vacuum as previous models, so it tends to accumulate blow-by byproducts more readily. Which isn't a major issue so long as you change the oil promptly.

When they found out it's a cash sale they were more than happy to find a tow truck to come get my mother.  I can remember being in my '95 Fleetwood that day, years after warranty over, and the IVR system was far more concerned with who's going to pay for this than getting me some help.  But, I must admit, I don't discriminate.   I hate all IVR systems equally.",Cadillac
"Did you check multi-car insurance? I‚Äôm 24 and pay $220 full coverage for a 2012 CTS V and ‚Äú4cyl‚Äù foxbody LX. Not sure about living situation but I would try my absolute best to workout a way to have both. If that‚Äôs not possible then I would pass for the next deal

I‚Äôm bias because the V2 is my sentimental dream car, with just injectors a 2.4 pulley/LTs/e50 blend got me 625whp in a supercharged Cadillac. It‚Äôs a fun daily for me",Cadillac

Did you not get a tune?,Cadillac
"Poor choice of words on my part. I meant failure as in why buy the V for 95k and go slower than the vette priced at 70k? 

So the performance marketing was a failure and very short sighted by Cadillac. 

MSRP for a Z06 at 505hp was like 65k and the XLR V with 443hp was almost 100k. 

It didn‚Äôt make sense. The only reason it sold at all was because the car was just bad ass in its own right, in my opinion.

The reason it didn‚Äôt sell much at all is because the performance aspects made less than zero sense. 

The base XLR with 300hp cost more than a Z06 LOL",Cadillac

"Then also, for shits and giggles, get under the car and check the carrier bearing. Unless the front wheel bearings are shot, that thumping noise shouldn't be coming from the brakes. Also consider engine mounts and trans mount. To check carrier bearing, get underneath it, push up and pull down.

"If you are turning 19, I would buy a cheap good running camry or something like that, that runs forever and is cheap to fix. At this state in your life, the last thing you want is an expensive car, especially at $5k a month income. Yes, I know, there is nothing sexy about that. But if I had a shot to go back in time, I would def change my car buying habits. I maybe have blown over $500k in cars. The WORST time to that is at your age or when you are just starting a family.

Is the 5K a month net or gross. Big difference. But as for buying cars like this, at your age, my biggest regret is spending too much on flashy cars. I finally learned my lesson in my 30's. 

My advice, by a car and pay for it in cash. NO payments is the game. Save. Save. Save. Maybe even put a bit away for light investing, and max out your IRA. 

Trust me, when you hit 40 and all your friends are in debt in cheap homes, you will quickly realize that cash is king and capitol is the name of the game.",Cadillac

"3rd gens have more complexity to them, so naturally they are more susceptible to problems, specifically in regards to electronics and software which can be such a pain to diagnose. 

3rd gens may be slightly more modern mechanically, but when mechanical issues arise, they are easier and more straightforward to diagnose in the 2nd gens. Plus, the interchangeability of the GMT800 models was greater than that of the GMT900 models, so parts are generally easier and cheaper to find for the 2nd gens.

"it partly depends on the vehicle.

if the model of Cadillac you're interested in has a Chevy/GMC counterpart, then its not bad at all.

example, my 05 Escalade EXT is a ""GMT800"" and shares parts with Suburban, Tahoe, Silverado, Sierra, Yukon Denali, etc...

random stuff like evap system is the same GM part numbers. 

the escalade came with a nice, but expensive suspension system that rides on bags of air filled from a small compressor. it works nice, but is light duty, and wears out fast for the cost. maintaining that would be expensive. however, it can simply be deleted and swapped out for conventional shocks from one of the other trucks. all the bolt holes are in the same spots and its rated for the same weight, etc. 

the biggest thing is just dont buy parts at all from the Cadillac Stealership. get parts from Rock Auto, or just Oreilly's, Advance Auto, Autozone, etc. the Stealership will straight up add a zero to the price, for the same OEM part (which are often just AC Delco parts).",Cadillac

"I don't care about mileage.  I wasn't lying to Traveler's about the mileage that I claimed to drive, and the data from GM would only back me up.

I don't like that they send other data on driving style, because I don't think necessarily is an accurate picture of the sort of driver someone is.  But what choice do we really have?

The story that I read about this said that GM (and others I'm sure) was sending data about how fast people drive.  Hard braking.  Hard acceleration.  If you live somewhere where there's a lot of traffic, you might brake hard more often than other people.  I suppose if you drive well over the speed limit much of the time, that is something that your insurance company could penalize you for; I don't want to pay for the reckless habits of others.  

But the one that bothered me was the ""hard acceleration"" data.  Cadillac used to compile monthly reports of my ""driving style.""  Probably still do, but I stopped checking a long time ago.   One area that they recommended improvement to me in was on ""hard acceleration.""  Maybe that's true to them, but it's just my driving style.  I really don't drive particularly fast anymore (I did as a young man), but I have always accelerated briskly away from stoplights.  I'm not pinning anyone to the back of their seats, but I do take off quickly.  Not speeding, but I usually do find myself well ahead of other drivers if I'm first in line when the light turns green.  It's just the way I drive, and it's not unsafe.  One thing I believe in as a driver is to spread out.  It always has bugged me when people seem to want to group together on a highway.  I shoot for the open road where there's more open space.  To me, that's the safest way to drive; you can't hit another car, and they can't hit you, if you're not close together.

So I would be concerned about how exactly insurance companies interpret the data they are receiving. But again, what can you do?",Cadillac

Your existing intake will get cold air by being routed to the lower fender.

Usually you don't need a tune for an intake because all it's doing is changing air temperature pre-turbo and the existing ecu will already adjust for it.

"So a little more of the story to help explain. The original owners wife was friends of my aunts. I first saw this car in 2019 at my uncles funeral and talked with the owner, Al after commenting on how well kept and its shape. Fast forward, they got a ridiculous repair estimate in 2020 after it wouldn't pass inspection with the CEL on. So it was parked back in the garage it lived its entire life in. In 2021 Al had a stroke and devolped Parkinsons thus losing his license. Well it came out of the garage and was parked in the driveway under a tree a little and mostly in direct sunlight. They decided to junk it but didn't want it going to the crusher, so they were going to give it to me, when their daughter mentioned scrap prices so Al and his wife gave me the price of $400 over the phone and we arranged a pickup with me believing the trans was out so was going to do a 5.3/4L60E swap. But decided to see how drivable I could make it after some TLC. Well the CEL was a TPS and she's needed an O2 sensor but other than a tuneup and idle adjustment she's run great! Definitely the score of a lifetime! Also it was so sweet when after handing me the keys and factory service manual bought with the car. They kept apologizing that they no longer had the original Gold Keys to give me.",Cadillac

"Both good options. Many folks will advise you to go ‚Äò19 and up on the CT6 for 10 speed transmission, but that would price you well above the 15K suggested budget. 

Thats a pretty good price point for a 60k used CTS. The only additional thought I‚Äôd offer is to save up a few more thousand and try to stretch for 20K. Educate yourself on the market in those months, and keep eyes open for a lower mileage buy. The warranty offered by GM will be much more affordable on a lower mileage CTS. Patience while building a few extra thousand in buying power to get a lower mileage car and cheaper extended warranty will serve you better in the long run maintenance conversation.

The CT6 is still fairly sporty - but you can save money and go smaller with an ATS, CT4, CTS, CT5 etc.


They're also more common so more suspension and powertrain parts are available.


That 2 ton rule is kinda outdated considering a lot of cars are pushing above 3500 right now unless it's a Miata - besides, the CT6 is probably one of the lightest full size cars due to the mostly aluminum construction. It kinda speaks to a lack of knowledge on modern crumple zones and the fact that low production cars like the CT6 never got IIHS testing for that reason.

If you do buy a battery from the dealership it has a 3 year warranty. AAA actually charges more for a battery than my dealer does.  So idk what your trying to prove here or have such a vendetta against.

Your comparison of the burger is a horrible example which I see what you were trying to get at with it, however your ignorance to how and what the Factory warranty covers is the issue.

about these types of make/model specific shops in general (not necessarily this one), many of them are just re-selling/drop shipping shit from ali-express with 30% markup, and often with unnecessary ship times so they can hold money and make interest.

boom, they go out of business. give zero fucks because they started the business as a $12 LLC. they make a new store based on next years new model. rinse repeat. ive seen it with plenty of cars/shops. reputations vary.

"With a new paint job and new taillights, I'd be cautious. Why? Was it rear ended?  Also, who painted it? Take a good look at the paint. I'd suggest taking it to a  mechanic to have a pre purchase inspection done as well.  

Also, ask for the dyno sheet. Another tune related question is did the tuner lock out the ecm, or can it be re tuned if needed, by a different tuner? 

It sounds like a decent car and a good deal, if it looks  good in person.  What area are you in?",Cadillac

"if the battery from the AAA guy is bad from the factory, and the customer paid for it, the customer can get it warrantied through AAA. theres no reason to expect GM to warranty a AAA battery, regardless whether factory defect or not, so this is a stupid premise to begin with. do you pull in to a burger king and try to get a refund when you dont like your Big Mac?

if the GM battery was defective, and they want it warrantied (i dont see the point, its more hassle to try that than just buying one from oreilly's but whatever), the customer can just tell the AAA to put the GM battery in the seat or trunk. 

if the customer thinks the stealership will try and weasel out of it, because you put a different battery in (they probably will), just drive the car to the stealership, put the bad battery back in, and submit a ticket for 'no start, car is in the lot' with no further explanation and let the tech figure it out.",Cadillac

Yes!!! Why are sedans fading away?? I just bought a 2017 CT6 and I‚Äôm LOVING it!! Have had Caddies for the past 15 years - except for my last vehicle which was a 2013 Jaguar XJL - the ‚ÄúL‚Äù stood for long body & I loved the size.  Was a nightmare once it passed 100k miles.  The universe saved me by having some idiot crash into me in line at the car wash.  Jolene the Jag was a total loss & I was able to get back into a Cadillac!! I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do when the last sedan is more than 8 years old!!!!

"Actually, allot of places have a much ""softer"" definition of hard acceleration.

When I was a driver I was regularly dinged for ""hard acceleration"" in our work trucks. I never ever even used half throttle in our 2500s or our f350s. Never once ever spun the tires. 
(Except for when they wanted the 2wd trucks to deliver in snow and we literally couldn't leave the yard because we were spinning)

I did however floor our extremely slow f750s because you couldn't get them up to speed. (They also never dinged for hard acceleration) Did dinged for hard braking though....but that's typically because morons think they can cut off a 20ft+ long flatbed truck with cargo in a busy city.

So it depends on the sensitivity of the GPS equipment used id think. Allot of the telemetry tech is used on company vehicles for insurance reasons. Even at my current job they have hidden the tech and call us if we ""speed"" or whatever",Cadillac

"I would start with the basic things. Change your intake filter. Clean your MAF and throttle body. Consider changing spark plugs and ignition coils. Depending on millage I would consider looking at o2 sensors becoming lazy. These are all just general tuneup items. 

When changing parts on these cars always go with oem. This doesn‚Äôt always mean GM Genuine or AC Delco as a lot of those parts are made by Bosch or Denso depending on the year as their suppliers flip flop a lot. 

Poor gas mileage can also point to vacuum leaks after the MAF. 

Get yourself a decent scan tool and learn o2 sensor patterns and what they mean. When you know what your looking at it provides so much insight into what your fuel and air is doing and will point you in the right direction for a proper diagnosis.

"I could be mistaken, but I thought the Cadillac Park Ave only appears in 1963, and was a marketplace flop, making them very rare and collectible.  To see the profile of the car looks like a customs shop has  been hacking on it, yet it was manufactured that way.  The customers didn't want them (obviously,) and parallel parking it was not leading people away from the brand.

"Because you don‚Äôt have a lot of black trim on the vehicle it might clash a bit with all the chrome/silver trim. 

My suggestion would be to look at getting black rims that have a machined face, that will give you the black rims and the silver/machined finish that will tie it back to the rest of the silver trim on the vehicle. I had a white Escalade with this type of finish and it looked good, always got compliments on them. 

You can also get some rims where the machine face has a tinted finish which tones down the silver and makes them look slightly darker but can still see the metal finish.

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs up to you and what you like. Don‚Äôt let other here deter you since everyone has their own style preference.",Cadillac

"My '21 XT4 PL was an amazing car. It's reliable and definitely loved it from the moment I got on it. It's one of GM's cars that I've not found on any unreliable ""list"". As expected, when things are working as expected, you dont hear anything about it. But when things go south, that's where the noise come from.

It's not expensive to maintain, it's pretty easy to take on long trips, it's comfortable and infotainment (CUE) is responsive enough. I think i had issues with my apple carplay once when I couldn't get it connected for maps. Only complain I had on mine was the interior cabin noise. It starts getting a little noisy as soon as I hit 65mph. I test drove the 24 XT4 and it wasn't any different interior noise wise. Just more modern dashboard from the 21. But very similar all in all. 

When I brought it in for service, the service manager I talked to said she had the same car and loved it very much. Only reason she lost it was to exchange it for a truck.",Cadillac

"Mine, and I can only assume every V3 out there kind of does this.  They hug the road and I mean they hug the fuck out of the road!  So while you'll drive and not feel anything on the road in, let's say an XTS, the V3 transfers every bit of the road to the driver.  These aren't even the same breed of cars.  They're performance first followed by whatever luxury they could splash on it without preventing them from hitting 201mph with two grown men in inside.

It's a five-seater C7 Z06 with a higher factory top speed (by 5mph).  Not exactly the choice for a long distance touring car.  You feel every defect on the road, but I love driving it!  Makes my heart happy listening to it.

If you're really considering one of these, I'd definitely second it, but if you're a not a skinny guy, get normal seats.  The Recaro's are nice, but you lose the cooling option and the bolsters dig a bit into my legs and back.",Cadillac

she rides on a cloud. maybe not a *magical* cloud, but its still a cloud. big/fast bumps can be a little bouncy, but its a soft, gentle and slow bounce, not jarring. i have no idea how well my dampening is working or if it needs replaced. 

i priced out the components from RockAuto, and its not too bad, but i just dont know often those components last, nor how long they'll even be available. i might restore it for shits and giggles if/when i got money to burn, but its a low priority...this ~20 year old gal got bigger issues at the moment im workin on.",Cadillac

"No lights or messages on the dash?  They had to remove the entire front end in order to swap the engine, including the transmission cooler mounted up front.  If it had a leak after reinstalling then it could eventually get low enough on transmission fluid to start slipping, essentially making every gear neutral.  You would surely notice puddles in your garage if this were the case though.

If it was your alternator then the battery light would be on, there would be a message on the display that says Service Charging System, and your interior electronics would start to go out as the battery got low.  Then it would just shutoff and not restart.  Service advisors aren‚Äôt techs and 90% of them don‚Äôt know dick.  Whatever the problem is, it will have a code set that a technician can use to pinpoint the problem.  

It‚Äôs under warranty and the repair will be free but it‚Äôs still inconvenient.  Lemon laws vary by state but you definitely bought a vehicle that is well known to be problematic.",Cadillac

"The ATS was initially slated to be a sedan, coupe, and convertible.

I forget why the coupe was delayed.  But I think there was an external reason, perhaps a strike.  The sedan launched in 2013 with decent sales, but the coupe didn't arrive until 2015.  By then, the buzz around the sedan was long gone.  The coupe, a great car (I have one), didn't sell well at all.  I think by then, the convertible didn't seem at all viable.

Cadillac portrays itself as a competitor to Audi, Mercedes, Lexus, and BMW.  But all of those makes offer full lineups of vehicles.  Cadillac no longer even offers a full-size sedan.  If you don't even bother to compete in the segments that your competition is in, you're not much of a competitor to them.",Cadillac

There is a dash app that shows how close you are but I don't trust it.  If you are careful you will be fine.  If you get impatient and haphazard about your parking you will be sorry.
