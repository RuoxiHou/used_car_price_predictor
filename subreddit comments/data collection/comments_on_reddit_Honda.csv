"Interesting I did not have that problem at Serra Honda in Akron, OH. However they did also tell me that this was the first time they've installed on a new civic (at least these workers).

If you go into my profile I have a landcruiser. The oldest post is right after I did my own paint correction on it. The paint was very dull before. You can tell how shiny it was after. I used all the chemical guys compounds to bring it back to life. Same with my civic I have. It was also dull before. Both original 35 year old paint.,Honda

I said im good and have been driving it for over 3 months now with no issue. The screw thing is still in my back right tire. Could that possibly cause it or no?

"hitch mounts are so much better IMO.  they're easily removable, so you don't really have to drive around with them all the time.  i would guess they have to at least affect your gas mileage a little bit.

>1) Just found this out the hard way - I turned my car off with the push button start/stop, but I forgot to move it into park. The car turned off successfully but rolled forward as I was getting out of it. 

>I feel like there should be a safety that doesn‚Äôt let you do this?

It is a safety feature to be able to shut off the car even though the select lever is not in park. 

For example, when Toyota vehicles would keep accelerating even though the driver was pressing the brake pedal. Shutting off the engine would stop the car from going faster and causing a wreck.

"You should follow the maintenance minder for the majority of things.

My 07 TSX while only has 125k miles, has the original transmission and original brake components. I just started replacing coolant items not because they failed but because they are getting around the mileage where they do.

"If it's clean, doesn't need a paint job, or body repair, runs, a/c works and lows hot and cold, and drives without anything to fix, it will give you many miles of service before you need to do anything to it other than regular maintenance.

It's a car from an era where cars were actually easy to fix in your driveway or garage without expensive specialized tools. You don't even need a scan tool to pull the codes. Just a piece of wire to jump the service terminal will allow you to get the car into diagnosis mode, and flash the codes to you.I'd pick one up(preferably manual) in that price range if it was clean enough.  


P.S. From the photos, it's a car I would go take a look at if I was in the market for an affordable car that won't give me issues for a while. At 160kmi the timing belt would've been changed at least once, preferably already 2x. Check the service records for it.",Honda
"Congrats!  I feel the Passport is the best SUV.  So roomy, but not too big and very maneuverable.  We take it on lots of ski trips, and have done some moderate off-roading on it.

"The GS 350 has been fantastic. My 2013 is old now and has over 226,xxx miles and overall great. Had a problem with the ac servo motors which burned out and had to be replaced, but that was the only problem with the car I‚Äôve experienced. I bought this car brand new and in the 11 years that‚Äôs the only problem we had. The car has some creaks now and the analog clock in the dash doesn‚Äôt work, but if I had to buy another 4 gen GS I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate. Honestly been eyeing a GSF lol. 

Bought the 2016 CT in 2019 and it‚Äôs been great also for what it is. My parents had Lexus RX for a long time and they‚Äôve never had problems with them. A first gen and third gen RX. I personally don‚Äôt like ES that much, perhaps since I come from a GS lol, but overall Lexus has been great. Fancy Toyotas, just change your fluids and go.",Honda

"Agree to disagree there my friend, I think the CRZ missed the mark all around.  2nd gen Fits are freaking sweet looking, also perfect daily's and super fun to drive around, can't help but smile driving a Fit around.

"Off the top of my head. Id say about 8 years give or take. For the fluids, we always used honda fluid. Oil filter was honda as well. Changed the coolant once a year. I did the transmission fluid twice a year. Oil was done based upon oil life hitting 20 percent. Sometimes he would drive more than other months.  (He was a courier). So it wasnt uncommon to change the oil once a month if not slightly more frequent. I put spark plugs in it every 100k. Outside of that, struts and shocks done on it about 3 or 4 times (i did not do those). And ya know. Surprisingly. I only had to put one ac compressor in it. That's all i can think of right now.

Edit: we never flushed the fluids. It was always just drain and fill.",Honda
"Honestly, it blows my mind. If you YouTube 'Million Mile Joe Honda Accord' you would clearly see that they through a fucking parade for that guy hitting a million miles with the original engine.

"4 cyl cvt? There is a very specific procedure to make sure the level is correct, and you must use the correct Honda fluid‚Ä¶. I would still have it done since going 100k miles on the original fluid is time to have it replaced",Honda

"That‚Äôs a load of BS from that shop. I have a 16 Accord and on the gauge cluster screen there is a Maintenance Minder code for it that comes up (I think it‚Äôs 3). The vehicle itself literally tells you to service the transmission fluid.

On CVT equipped models, you can even see the transmission dipstick tube with the HCF2 fluid label on it right from the front of the engine bay so it‚Äôs definitely meant to be serviced and not a ‚Äúsealed‚Äù unit. 

Depending on driving conditions I believe it‚Äôs supposed to be changed every 50k miles roughly but if you drive it harder then it‚Äôs safer to go down to 30k intervals.",Honda

The extra knock resistance will help the head gasket stay in one piece too.

I've said it before and I'll say it again. These engines will have a short life on 87 octane, and I'm being proven right all the time. I know for a fact those motors don't hit their target timing value due to knock. Knock breaks things, specifically head gaskets and pistons.

Is it the H5 automatic transmission they put in everything? Those units when paired with the smaller cars like Civics and Fit are bulletproof.

"So lucky for you, I own a 2017 Pilot EXL and a 2023 Odyssey Touring.   

So granted it isn‚Äôt the newer Pilots but I figure it will be similar enough. It is much easier to get kids in the odyssey obviously. The lower ride height and larger opening of the sliding door makes a difference. The odyssey is similar sized but about a foot longer. 

If I had to strap a kid into the third row with car seats in the second row of the pilot, it would be darn near impossible and even without a car seat not comfortable. Much easier to do in the odyssey. The additional cargo area of the odyssey is also great when traveling. We had a hitch platform for the pilot and I can fit all the same stuff on the inside of the odyssey.",Honda

If the knuckle was in such a state after just making a turn, it makes me wonder how did it become so weak?  What did it hit?  Did that weaken or damage other things down there?

It‚Äôs driven by the electric motor up to a certain speed (~50km/h iirc), then a clutch connects the engine directly to the wheels at a 1:1 drive ratio, with the electric motor intermittently engaging to assist with passing/acceleration. 

You‚Äôre right about the fuel mileage though. My parents just bought a CR-V Hybrid Touring, with the majority of their driving being on the highway. They say the fuel mileage is on par if not slightly better than their ‚Äò21 Ridgeline. I suspect you would see the most savings if you did mostly city driving at low traffic speeds.",Honda

"If you replaced battery in december, then it could be the fuel injector or the painted surface where the ground connection is. That was on my friends crv, after some sanding it's fine again. But test the battery first, because that is the easiest. If you want to test it yourself, you can buy a cheap battery tester on amazon or in the shop. (shhht, I always return it after testing, because I only need to use it once.)

The fuel injectors aren't easy to access. You will need to remove the plastic cover and place the tip of a long screwdriver on each fuel injector (below the manifold on the back of the engine). Put your ear on the end of the screwdriver. If you hear a clicking sound on each injector while the engine is running, then it works. Could also be carbon buildup, you can try some fuel injector cleaners.

Some shops will test batteries for free.  I have no idea where, because I live in The Netherlands.
  
Condensation is fine in exhausts, but usually found at the tips. You might have a hole there, or its from somewhere above? Check where it is coming from.

"They're technically right, at least for many cars. Not 100% sure about OP's specifically. He's referring to many cars transmissions/fluid being designed to last the lifetime of the vehicle without being changed.

The question with this wording is simply ""Whats the designed lifetime of the vehicle?""

Some of my friends who are engineers in the auto industry, they design cars to for sure last longer than 100k miles but literally nothing (at least for their companies) is designed to reach 200k or above. Many cars may do this anyways, but it wasn't part of the design consideration.

Personally I'd flush or at least do a drain and fill every 60k miles",Honda

Cause no joke, even stock odyssey has some get up and go most the time. That 3.5V6 is actually no joke when it comes to out of the box factory engines.

In the dunes of Arabia, those crazy bastards rip those out of old Honda pilots. Slam them into a honky sand slapper. Twin turbs with stock cranks, and pistons, head and all.

Sure it only last them the weekend, before it's a smoldering red hot mess. But next Friday, what are they doing? Ripping the heart put of another Honda Pilot!

I have a theory about minivans and why people think they are slow. Anyone who has ever driven an odyssey will tell you the accelerator has a ""Yes and no"" setting. So it's either turtle mode, or spin till you win mode.

NGK changed their plugs and started plating the threads with something that is corrosion resistant and acts like anti seize. Using anti seize can cause you to over torque the plugs by 20-30% and change the heat range of the plug. And always check the plug gap before installing.

If it were my own vehicle, I would replace basically every other wear part as well. So add inner and outer tie rod, upper control arm (comes with new bushings and ball joint), lower control arm, sway bar links, and maybe the axle too.

Also times that by two, if one side gave out like that, the other side is probably thinking about it.

They had a couple of the ADV160s at the dealer I went to, and honestly I kinda like them. I like the Ruckus a bit more in terms of design but the ADV160s seem like pretty capable bikes.

Those things and all Hondas from that era are tanks! Continue taking care of it like it deserves to be taken care of and you will get another 200K out of it. If you buy a new car depending on the manufacturer you would be lucky to get 150K out of it without it needing some sort of serious repair.

"It depends on your situation, for me here is where I am coming from. The non-hybrids use a turbo. IMO I don't like them simply because they put excessive wear on the engine, are not fuel efficient unless you drive like an old person and make it more difficult to do repairs (having to take the turbo and exhaust off to replace the water pump is asinine). This is from what I have been seeing with the last gen Accord, did they fix this on the current gen, I hope but I wouldn't think so.

The hybrid doesn't use the turbo but is not ideal for me. I don't drive over 7000 miles on my car a year and do keep my cars for over 10 years (currently have a 07 TSX with 125k miles). So battery replacement just because of age doesn't make sense to me.",Honda

"It's not shifting. If it's a CVT it's only doing a sort of mockery of shifting. In fact Nissan started doing it as a way to make it a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for certain customers. (Source: told to me by a corporate Nissan representative back when I sold cars at the leading dealership in my state)

A CVT or continuously variable transmission does not have gears like an old automatic, but rather a belt running on two cones. The smaller side of the cone can be sort of (in a manner of speaking) considered like the small sprocket on a 10 speed bicycle. Harder to pedal and easier acceleration. Then when you shift the bicycle, to a larger sprocket it's easier to pedal and you can go faster at top speed, that would be in a manner of speaking similar to the larger side of the cone (That's the only way I can explain it in layman's terms, I am not an engineer but it gets the point across) When Nissan first came out with CVTs, if you pinned the gas it would go up to a high rev spot and stay there the entire time. From 0 mph all the way up to the maximum speed etc. Some people didn't like it. So they changed it, it now simulates an experience that feels similar to an automatic transmission. It could also be better for the engine that way as well. That way it's not constantly up at redline or close to Red Line. But they are nothing alike. You find that you do not like it then I suggest maybe you try to learn manual shift and get one for your next car. I hate to say it but for the people who do not like CVTs, there's a good chance there will be nothing else other than CVTs once we hit a certain point. Though I could be wrong as certain manufacturers may never make the switch ü§∑ (unless they have already? I haven't been keeping track)",Honda

"A lot of times it depends on the country you are in and what the company can get away with.  The United States is much more customer service focused than many other countries.  A large reason is that here, customers have more rights against companies along with resolution options.  

Even our Canadian neighbors seem to have less available recourses than we do in the US.  I have family there and one member has had significant issues with their new vehicle for the same issue repeatedly.  Their are no lemon laws in his region or anything like that so he has been at the mercy of the manufacturer.  This same situation would never have made it this far in the US.  

Other countries are even less accommodating with a ""you take what you can get"" attitude and companies act like you are lucky they are even letting you buy from them.  

Again, this is very dependent on your country's laws in regards to these things.  If dealers and manufacturers don't need to accommodate after-sales support...you better believe they won't because if they do it means it costs them money for nothing.  You are one customer out of millions.  

And with that...good luck trying to reach Honda's CEO.  The best you can expect is someone from Honda's local corporate presence to reach out to you.  I highly doubt your situation will warrant the CEO's attention.  If every Honda customer that wasn't satisfied with their purchase could complain directly to the CEO, and assuming ALL he did was listen to customer complaints, he would have a queue that is years out. 

Again if you can't get help from the dealer you bought it from, you can perhaps try another dealer to honor the warranty (if you have one) otherwise research your local laws with how to handle a situation like this.  Also, if you purchased the car with these issues, often they will say the responsibility is on you to inspect the vehicle you are purchasing prior to committing to it.",Honda

"No OCD here. It's why my other car lasted twenty years, and sold for top dollar...because food in a car deposits baceria that festers into coonies that evolve into a biome within the car, creating that ""smell"".

The ""used car smell"" is a complex olfactory experience arising from the interaction of organic materials with the car's internal microbial ecosystem. This presentation will explore the scientific underpinnings of this phenomenon, highlighting its impact on vehicle value.
Phase 1: Deposition and Colonization
Ingress of organic matter into the car's interior occurs via various routes:
Food and beverages: Spills, crumbs, and sugary residues become a readily available carbon source for microbes.
Fragrances: Artificial scents and body odor comprise a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that some microbes can metabolize.
Body Odors: Human sweat harbors a diverse microbial community. Bacteria on skin break down sweat components like proteins and lipids, generating characteristic odors.
Moisture: Condensation from breath and humidity provides a crucial element for microbial growth.
These organic materials adhere to car surfaces (carpets, upholstery, plastics) due to:
Porous fabrics: Fibers trap food particles and offer a high surface area for microbial colonization.
Hydrophobic surfaces: Fabrics and plastics repel water, allowing organic matter to concentrate.
Phase 2: Microbial Proliferation and Biodegradation
The deposited organic material serves as a substrate for various microbial communities. These communities are dominated by:
Bacteria: Particularly proteolytic and lipolytic species that break down proteins and fats from food, sweat, and skin flakes.
Fungi: Molds thrive in humid environments, contributing to musty odors and potential allergens.
Microbial activity leads to the biodegradation of organic matter, generating a range of volatile metabolites:
Short-chain fatty acids: Products of protein and fat breakdown, responsible for pungent ""cheesy"" or ""sour"" smells.
Aldehydes and ketones: Breakdown products of VOCs and other organic matter, often contributing to a sharp or acrid odor.
Microbial byproducts: Ammonia, thiols (sulfur-containing compounds), and other volatile products with unpleasant odors.
Phase 3: Olfactory Assault and Value Depreciation
The volatile metabolites produced by microbial activity collectively define the ""used car smell."" This odor is perceived as unpleasant for several reasons:
Evolutionary aversion: Humans have an innate aversion to foul odors, which can signal potential health hazards.
Association with neglect: A strong used car smell suggests a lack of prior cleaning and maintenance, potentially indicating underlying mechanical issues.
The presence of this odor significantly reduces a car's perceived value. Potential buyers associate the smell with uncleanliness, past ownership habits, and potential health risks. This can translate to a lower selling price or difficulty finding a buyer altogether.",Honda

"Before Covid, many manufacturers ran leasing deals. They would offer deeper lease discounts to try and move cars. So a couple times a year you could get a lease that was 20-30% lower than the norm. Sometimes they would offer something like the OPs price with no money down. And as long as you didn‚Äôt go over the mileage your 3 year cost of ownership was quite low. Then Covid hit. With vehicle shortages there is absolutely no reason to offer a good discount on leases. They were never designed for people that keep a vehicle ten years.",Honda

"There is no such thing as lifetime fluids. Lifetime generally means up to a certain milage/kilometer or amount of years for example, lifetime = when your warranty is over. So they won't change the fluids when it's them covering the cost but once that's over and it breaks because you didn't get the fluids changed, it's up to you to pay for it. 

To be safe, if you have over 40,000 miles on your car, take it somewhere they'll change your transmission fluid. I thought by now this shit would be illegal.",Honda
"I paid 4250 for a 93 wagon with 217k. He had just put 5k of maintenance into it and was sad to see it go.

Consider doing the maintenance on it and listing it on bring a trailer, a few years ago one sold for around 15k with sub 100k miles.",Honda
"If you really wanna sell it, I would consider fixing those issues first, they‚Äôre pretty easy fixes and it takes away anything for someone to pick at when looking at it.

But with today‚Äôs market and how rarely I see these nowadays, I would say you could probably at least go for 5-7k if you find an enthusiast, probably more if you cleaned it up enough for bringatrailer.

"As already stated either you have a warped rotor, a rotor with a build up of pad material, or a bent hub assembly.

Warped rotors happen from thermal shock. If you're on the interstate and you slam on the brakes suddenly, congratulations you just ruined your front rotors. If you come off the interstate, brake hard, and come to a stop with your foot holding the brake you will burn the face of the pad into the rotor. Then every time you're on the brakes and the pads hit that spot in the rotor it's going to grab harder since like materials have greater cohesion than the adhesion of two dissimilar items. Notice how the sticky side of tape sticks to itself better than anything else? Same concept. You could also have a bent hub assembly, which can happen as the result of a collision with another vehicle or a curb. If your hub is bent, replacing the rotors will do nothing.",Honda

The limit they will allow on the front and rear brake pads is 2/32.  Same with tires.  Everytime I go in for service, they give me numbers and any areas of concern.

I always change my air and cabin filter myself.  I keep track of what was done on which date and the mileage on excel.

The oil change specials are long gone.  My dealership always has specials on wiper blade replacement, battery, front and rear brakes.

In order to take advantage of high octane fuel the car would have to be tuned. A car requiring a minimum of 87 octane will make its full power on that fuel, with the exception of modern turbocharged vehicles running on 87. They are running at reduced timing to mitigate knock which reduces power output and will make full power with better fuel.

The only way to tell is to know what the target ignition value is and see if it's hitting that value while datalogging. If it's hitting it you will not gain anything with premium fuel. You can also 'over octane' an engine, at a certain point you'll actually lose power.",Honda

Said people always called and vistited because they had a 2.0T for sale but saw it and never called him again.  Just takes a little TLC to make the car yours in my opinion

Some makes like Nissan claim their CVTs are sealed lifetime units but then they‚Äôre also failure prone and people that do end up changing the fluids on them by dropping the pan or whatever end up getting more life out of them. 

Page 511 of the owners manual shows you the Maintenance Minder code 3 showing that transmission fluid is indeed a regular service item. 

Page 525 and 526 of the owners manual shows you what fluid each type of transmission takes along with saying to check and replace if necessary.

"Hey and welcome. First, my background, my family has had 3 CRVs. A 2015 that my daughter bought used at 19k miles, currently has 80k. A 2020 hybrid that we loved but traded in to get a Nissan Leaf. And my 2018 we bought new that has 158k on it.

The CRVs are popular for good reason. They are comfortable, spacious enough for 4 and will fit 5 in a squeeze, plenty of power, quick enough to not embarrass itself, and has great tech. The infotainment is starting to show its age but is good enough to not be a concern for most people.

My honest opinion and suggestion is to make the sacrifice and step up to the EX, don't get the LX. There are a couple of features that you don't think are a big deal, but once you live with them, you'll wonder how you lived without them. The main one is keyless entry and auto lock when you walk away. Not having to fumble for keys and just opening the door is soooo nice. But the auto lock is great. I can't tell you how many times I've left my wife's Leaf unlocked because I forget it doesn't have that feature.

You also get a bigger screen on the dash. I had a 2019 Insight LX and hated the radio due to the screen size. I think the safety tech is the same, but make sure you get lane keep assist and adaptive cruise. They make road trips so much safer and easier. The sunroof is take it or leave it for me but is nice to have. Seat warmers come in very handy on cold mornings.

The move to the EX is a couple grand, but really is worth it. Either way, you won't be disappointed. They are great cars.",Honda

You set one off, leave the car closed up with the fan on full for 10-15 minutes, then let it air out.  The car will have an intense swimming pool smell for a week or two but any mustyness will be gone.  Probably best to have a professional do it but its an option.",Honda

Then again I wouldn't put anti-seize on a spark plug that I wasn't supposed to put it on. There are spark plugs that have the shiny coating that are already treated to not need it. However there are other spark plugs with regular Black oxide for example. It's okay to put it on the plugs that are not already coated however I wouldn't recommend putting it on the plugs that are already coated.

I dont think its too much if it runs well. That actually looks nice. I would buy it. You're not gonna find a running Honda any cheaper than that price. Unless its completely beat up. That one actually looks in good shape. Put some seat covers on it. Apply a good clay bar treatment to the paint followed by a paste wax and then its gonna look much better.

"If it's an automatic, that's the version. Honda has an above average automatic transmission reputation, but not perfect. However, the H5 combined with the smaller engines compared to all the other contemporary small cars is probably the most durable combination from that era. The Nissan and Ford small cars sold that same year with automatic transmissions.would have needed five transmissions each to reach those miles. Ha! As much as I love a Honda with a stick shift, this combination is probably even more rugged or at least needing fewer dollars to maintain. Just a little fluid here and there.

"I've seen plenty of salvage accords that were repaired as cheaply as possible to maximize profit. Depending on the level of damage a lot of these cars are either now less structurally sound, develop annoying noises that are hard to track down or have suspension/frame damage that was never properly addressed and results in uneven tire wear or pulls that don't go away. Furthermore the issues used cars have still remain and it all depends on how well the car was maintained in the years before it was written off.

If you can get a pre-purchase inspection done and the damage repair is satisfactory and an alignment check comes back good, sure. I personally think 7500 is a bit on the high end for a '12, and if you ever plan on getting rid of it you can kiss resale value goodbye. Aside from that a salvage repair can be excellent bang for the buck and I've had a few friends of mine buy salvage Hondas that got them around with no issue.",Honda

"Your vehicle's [Maintenance Minder](https://mygarage.honda.com/s/honda-maintenance-minder) will notify you when to change certain fluids and when to perform other tasks. Your car's computer uses data from the engine and the climate to notify you when the optimal time is to perform maintenance. With the exception that, if a Maintenance Minder indicator does not appear more than 12 months after the display is reset, change the engine oil every year. Or if a Maintenance Minder message does not appear more than 36 months after the display for item 7 is reset, change the brake fluid every 3 years.

Follow the Maintenance Minder. There are sub items, such as, inspections that should be done to catch small problems before they become big problems. There is no set guide on how to maintain a car for thousands of miles because every car is driven and maintened differently. Vehicles are also in different climates, a car that spends most of its time in a desert will have different needs than a car that is driven in snow for half a year.

I originally planned to keep her in tip top shape but have had a rough few years with little money and low motivation to keep up with maintenance. I really would like to get another 169,000 miles out of her. I know I need to get her seen by a repair facility quick if I don't want her to breakdown on me.

It could be that the bank info entered might have been a number off. You should get a letter in a couple days letting you know the reason. It should also say online something like unable to locate account. It won't hurt your credit unless it goes 30 days past due. It might be best to delete the bank info you input and reenter it again. Then you'd have to make a 1 time manual payment for this month and it should take effect going forward.

Sometimes you can build up pad material from improperly bedded pads and/or lots of light braking.  This manifests like warped rotors but is an easier fix.  One way to check is to do several hard stops from 50 or 60 (in a safe place to do so).  If the pulsing gets better its likely the cause.  You can pull the rotors and scuff them in circles with a scouring pad and clear things up a lot of times.,Honda

"**Title:** Dissatisfied with my Honda Jazz Purchase - Complaint

Hello Reddit community,

My name is Ergun KUTLU, and I purchased a Honda Jazz from the ILICAK HONDA dealership in Malatya on March 7, 2024. However, the experience I had after purchasing the car left me extremely disappointed.

Upon receiving the car, I noticed significant flaws such as stains on the body and damages to the antenna. Despite purchasing a new vehicle, we never expected to encounter such issues. I reported the situation to the dealership authorities, but the response I received did not provide any satisfaction in resolving the problems.

What's saddening is that the suggestion from HONDA customer service was presented as if it were a favor, which greatly bothered me. It surprised me how a reputable company like Honda approached such customer dissatisfaction in this manner.

I wanted to share my experience with your community and voice the problems I faced. I am considering issuing a media statement along with evidence and pictures depicting the issues.

Therefore, I request for this matter to be resolved, and an appropriate solution to be provided to me. Otherwise, I regret to inform you that I will have to share this matter with a broader audience.

Thank you.

"Leave it NA. With solid bolt on and some minor work you can get 250 crank. Personally I would go ITB and cams, a nice 4-1 header, a solid tune - it would rev and sound wicked.
