"That makes sense, they offer spring upgrade packages for Ironman 4x4 springs.

Currently living in S.korea so getting parts and getting things fixed are very easy. But it doesn't mean it got brake much.  AS me and many people experienced About the brand(Had Kyrons and 1st gen Rextons), they don't have major issues if it is not a lemon. One of Mine had ran 230,000km(euro 4 2.0 CRDI diesel, with DPF. My older friend who took it changed DPF for about 300usd and changed transmission to MB 5 tronic from older models because euro 4 model of my 4x4-2009 kyron have bad transmission that have really bad shifting) before i bought a new one. It had some design problem that is hard(risky. It can broke in to pieces and could fell into the engine) to replace glow plug but it is fixed when they updated their engine to Euro6 2.2. i heard early models that have SCR system have some related issues but it also got fixed when they updated their engine(again) to euro6d, 202hp(200bhp) engine...and If dealerships have parts, it can be fixed by almost any mechanics. Design have No nonsense (weird things like german luxury cars). And Koreans only get 2 year warranty and they are fine with that... (5 years on engine and transmission) so i guess it is not that bad of choice if you get new ones because warranty will cover most of the things and it's cheaper than other trucks. It's cheap but Not ""cheap-cheap"". Just good value since they are minor brand. Test drive one if you can. What i experienced and experiencing is this is better than a hyundai/kia at least...",SsangYong
Damn.. So empty,SsangYong

"The car needs a key with a frequency of 433mhz and this key sends out 315mhz. The original key also sends out 433mhz and of course functions with the car. The car doesn’t recognize this new key because it can’t read its frequency output. So I need an other key that sends out 433mhz. The wierd thing is if I look up the part number of this particular key it says it that it should send out 433mhz.

Just be aware that if you're using Apple CarPlay/Android Auto to play music or whatever at the same time, it acts more like a wireless charger and just trickle charges the phone. Sometimes, if you're streaming music via the app it will only just 'float the load' or put in what it is taking out so appears that it isn't actually charging the phone.

"Honestly this car is an absolute steal in terms of value for money. Bought mine with 10k kms on it, done another 40k km in space of 8 months. I have ELX auto, probably carrying 200-300kg at all times in the back and the diesel consumption comes to about 8l on freeways and about 9,5-10l in city driving. Plenty of grunt, good seating space at the back, good speakers and audio system (navigation via Android Auto/ Apple play)

I have absolutely nothing to complain about in terms of build quality or features, but the options fitted in Australia by Ssangyong dealer are somewhat disappointing:

\- 3rd party Canopy, leaked, one lock doesn't close, loose screws inside the locking mechanism, light cable connector loose. My canopy only have back window that fully opens which makes it difficult to utilise all the space in the back.

\- 3rd party roof racks (pro rack) Although there are factory fitted mounting points, dealer decided to go with bracket type roof mounts (metal plate that fits under your door rubber). This makes the door bit hard to close - you have to somewhat slam it to close. 9 out of 10 people who were my passengers had to try couple of times.

\- Dual battery system was installed on the back of the ute tray, I would rather have it mounted to the side next to wheel arc. Because of it shorter draws were fitted leaving awful lot of nooks where staff can drop in.

\- With ELX (shorter wheel base) if you planning to add tow bar, spare wheel will have to be removed from underneath the car. Air Suspension Helper Kit for Coil Springs will save your suspension if you planning to carry larger loads.

\-With ladders on the roof rack, i still sit under 2,2m so I can use some of the underground / shopping mall car parks",SsangYong
"2.2 diesel won't fit in this car. It's too big for this boy. especially if it needed to mount in transverse rayout.(and it need DPF and SCR too for Strict Euro6d standard emission control.

It's light and that turbo will take care of torque. And in korea, engines under 1600cc get tax discount

"Those are the same locker that GM uses on everything that move. GM's name is G80 and Eaton's name is Mlocker. They are proven for decades. Don't worry about them. You just need to know how to use them.

And Ssangyong is definitely more reliable than Hyundai/Kia. 

They are really proud of their engine's life expectancy and the transmission is literally same with hilux and D Max. 

It have the best frame for midsize truck(that can make possible max load+max towing at the same time)

They kinda fuqed up Offroad capability for stock vehicle by messing up approach angle and wheelwells but you can go around it by modding. Those trucks are quite reliable and relatively easy to fix/repair thanks to no nonsense design.

(Some model year had problem with SCR but it got solved after they upgraded engine and stuff)

Only thing i concern is, Australia get nerfed version Musso AFAIK...did they changed the engine and stuff for Australia too?

And I recommend to test drive one and have some rear seat experience. 

Oh, and Ssangyong have superior paint quality over Hyundai/kia or even somr Japanese makers .(ssangyong's reputation of high quality paintjob was ruined by rustbox vehicles debuted on 2005. But now their paintjob have high quality...again)

"I have a 2019, bought used last year. Nothing but good things to say. I have had an EGR valve fail, but it was a 4 day ordeal to get parts, installed and back on the road with improved fuel economy, all under warranty.",SsangYong
Does the connector work on other devices?,SsangYong
I might change ECU and watch how it is going. Too much engine related error codes. It maybe the ECU,SsangYong
"Oh no, I'm sick of that on the jimny, in fact it's one of the main things I want to leave behind forever",SsangYong
"I have a 2.2l automatic. I can’t afford to run a 3.2l diesel in the UK! I love it to be honest, there were a few things I am glad I got with the ranger I would not have got with the SsangYong, such as a heated front screen and cruise control.",SsangYong
"Ah, got ya 👍",SsangYong
How you finding it? Considering one,SsangYong
Hey there. Came here with the same questions? Did you buy it? How is it?,SsangYong
Much appreciated for the detailed answer! Might actually buy it now. Really liked the looks of it and what it offers on paper.,SsangYong
Ssangyong did not commercially released straight 6 diesel engine. I think 2.7 xdi engine can be put in in the musso(need to change a lot tho),SsangYong
"On average around 32mpg, so the same. Better on long journeys! I don't think I want to go back to manual gearbox now :-)",SsangYong
CBR?,SsangYong
"Bought one before christmas '23. Classic 1,6 petrol 18"" wheel. Drive good, sound very nice, look good, big trunk and eazy price (Best bang for the buck). Im sceptic in general, so I'm waiting every minute for something to go wrong...",SsangYong
What wheel size?,SsangYong
"I don’t know about the 2017 models but the new ones have some reading signs option so it might be that it reads the signs of speed limit and limits your speed according to them? 
Have you found any other answers by now? Have you had any problems with it? I intend to buy a new one.",SsangYong
"I have almost the same issue, although i have to lock mine 7 times to lock not 5. 

I did start using the drivers door locking button instead though as i wore out one of the key fobs.

Out of interest did you manage to fix the problem? what was the solution?",SsangYong
"Not that I did a lot of soft offroading, but it has a really good ground clearance, no worries hitting anything on the bottom of the car, and it has a locking differential, so a 50-50 split awd if you ever get stuck. About longer trips, I drove for 8 hours in one day not long ago and it was awesome, little back pain but expected after such a long trip. Reliability was good, in 4 years we had it, we only changed the radiator cuz of a leak. And now we need to change the brake callipers and front brakes, but thats just wear and tear parts. You also need to check when/if timing chain was replaced, it needs to be every ~120k km. And its not costly to maintain, regular yearly services dont cost any different than any other car of that class. Car is awesome and it has a lot of room and Im 195 cm tall, boot space is big as hell too. Only downside is that there isnt a lot of Ssangyongs in my country so you need to wait for parts on order little longer than other mainstream cars.",SsangYong
~1993 Korando Have almost same Frame of CJ7  as far as i know,SsangYong
Thx for answering! I've done that but nothing seems to be missed,SsangYong
"Yeah da fuq with all those mobility stuff that haunting land vehicle industry???? All those Great Corpo Heads and Shareholdes have really bad taste(as they always did) I really don't like the name ""Mobility"" neither!! And I was a ssangyong fan since I don't have my license. My father had couple of their 4x4 and their van was one of my school bus. And my first car was ssangyong. 

I even personally purchased Ssangyong letterings from ssangyong parts shop(for export mussos. some parts shops have those) for my truck since they don't got any name on the truck. Only one emblem in front shows this is a ssangyong 4x4. 

anything is better than ""Mobility"". Those rental electric Scooter companies and taxi companies using the exact same term.... something something Mobility.... What's wrong with Motors?? Even just KG Land vehicle Division will sound far better than KG Mobility. the only Saving grace is they will keep the emblems for now(KDM one that Opel sued.. because circles are so similar to their Z.... , and one with wing on it for exports.)


those pavement princess owners that have Jeep Ford, Chevy .. Even Hyundai and Kia owners(Kia have one Pseudo 4x4 and Hyundai don't have any 4x4 except 4x4 version of their commercial vehicles...koreans are infamous for don't know any s**t about cars and trucks) 
Because Ssangyong very small for legit automaker(that actually makes their own vehicle chassis and engines) and was in very bad financial situation in past 10+ years.... 

and i don't think they shoud brag about they bought a Hyundai or kia FFS...their engine and transmission... just like all hyundai's fwd transmission, exploding everywhere on earth right after warrenty ends (some of the lucky customers get their engine or transmission broken so quick so they can be covered with Warrenty...)",SsangYong
"It seems like there are some in europe via Ebay. But if it is just scratch, isn't it better to just re paint it or use scratch remover?

And if you need it brand new, dealerships or any costumer service will be better than find it online if there are official dealerships in your area.",SsangYong
Relatably small automobile manufacturer Purchased by even more smaller EV company. Rare sight to see.,SsangYong
"It depends on the type of AIR CONDITIONER and manufacturer. There are several aircon types for this vehicle.  
I can look for matches if there is a number from the compressor tag or the last 6 digits of the VIN.",SsangYong
"Dealerships are always useless ! 😂 Never buy a Manual Musso. They are terrible. they are made by hyundai(known for not that great manual T)so terrible they stopped sell them in domestic market. Everyone who bought Manual got disappointed.  Always Get Automatic. Aisin AC60 6 speed . The most durable light truck automatic transmission! Oh and get smallest rims you can get if you want the truck to be stock as possible. 

And you need to remove front mudguard to put decent tires.... (It really seems like They were in hurry when they are making the cabin.. so many minor oversights can be seen when you modding your vehicle.they made great frame tho)",SsangYong
"what type of wheel drive?  
part time or TOD?",SsangYong
Our Korando does similar. Passenger door wont lock. Need to lock it manualy to lock doors,SsangYong
put back the stock lamp,SsangYong
"I have it too, ithink it's just a filler plug for some accessories that you don't have",SsangYong
You can check the software version in AV setup mode. If I understood you correctly.,SsangYong
Maybe in korea. In pyungtaek(Ssangyong's Office and Factory are there),SsangYong
"Automatic transaxle fluid  Change every 100000 km under severe condition

  
If vehicle is operated under severe condition: Shorten the service interval. 

- Towing a trailer or off-road driving (Inspect the leak of fluid at any time, occasionally) 

- Taxi, patrol service or delivery service (extended idling and excessive driving with low speed) 

- Frequent stop-and-go traffic, extended idling, short driving distance 

- Driving in a hilly or mountainous terrain, sandy, or dusty area 

- Driving frequently at high speed over 170 km/hour 

- Driving frequently in area where heavy traffic under the ambient temperature above 32°C",SsangYong
"Only 160hp? It is more than enough output for cars that ligh

Look at thise diesel engine equipped vehicle's horsepower!

And it's not about max power you know... especially on economic car like korando1.5. 

Ssangyong usually focus on low rpm performance. And don't cranking up the max Horsepower like Hyundai/kia. 

And turbo works well too.

So it will perform really good on street . 

I bet you 'll have no problem.

And previous gen Korando was a complete mess Mostly Thanks to transmission. they chaged transmission to aisin 6 speed and gave 2.2 diesel, it became OK. 

(09 to 15 Ssangyongs have bad transmission if it is not MB transmission Thanks to Troubled financial situation of Ssangyong. that DSI 6speeds were only thing that they can afford. And i experienced rear whell drive version of that transmission. Yeah worst of that generation)",SsangYong
"CJ7’S fit nicely 

some people use YJ's too",SsangYong
"This car has the worst automatic transmission Ssangyong has ever used.  
DSI M11 6A/T  
Dont mess with it.",SsangYong
"yeah most stock 4x4s look goofy because they are lowered for safety test and regulations. 

lift up and give some larger tires makes far better looking 4x4s",SsangYong
"Nice, I also just read that pressing the power button for 10+ seconds may reset it. But I'm not going to try that :D",SsangYong
"Nice one mate. Sorry, late to this thread. 

Gatton Auto?

I got my 2022 Musso Ultimate with luxury pack from there as I'm just up the road about 80km. Great team, nothing was or is too much hassle. 

Mine is Indian Red and after a wash it just glows. Goes like a bought one too. Great work.",SsangYong
"Your door lock relay might be faulty. 

Fyi the door lock relay is in the door lock actuator. 

I will try and get my car to the mechanic now, I gave up trying to fix it myself hahaha.
I can't seem to source for a cheap second hand part around where I live",SsangYong
That bumper looks Really nice. steel bumbers are illegal in S.Korea...,SsangYong
"Ah seems like Australia is not following mandatory Euro6d Regulations. Well the spare tire rack is small ASF( this is tradition... da fuq Ssangyong. And korean models did not came with a spare even ,before the tank got installed.... wtf Ssangyong!l)",SsangYong
Why would the transmission have anything to do with it? Surely it’s a camera bulb or wiring fault? Do you know where I can get a free electrical schematic?,SsangYong
Have you tried changing the sound to a more pleasant one?,SsangYong
"I have the same.  
I'm not sure, but maybe it's something for the wireless charging package.",SsangYong
"I would it would depend on WHICH merc alternator you’re thinking of, but you would want to make sure the specs match up so you don’t fry anything 

I’d probs get a mechanic’s opinion tbh, the electrics are pretty important",SsangYong
I don't know much about ssangyongs bit i reckon it's just a little system glitch so take it to your dealer,SsangYong
