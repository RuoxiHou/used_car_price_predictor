"I can do when I‚Äôm in my car, I can‚Äôt get to it atm. I have a screenshot from Google if that helps?",Renault
I swear I‚Äôve seen this car somewhere before,Renault
Life is boring. Why not,Renault

"They should be automatically adjusted by the rear calipers. That's why you have to turn them back into the caliper, unlike pressing them back like the front calipers.",Renault
"If it's been taken past it's service interval, that will significantly lower a future part exchange price, with dealerships refusing to accept the car in part exchange altogether.",Renault
"The F4R(t) is a bulletproof engine.   
  
Same 2.0 F4R in the Renaultsport Clio MK1, 2 etc?",Renault
I did not have any cable and I won't see the car anymore before buying because it is too far away.,Renault
It looks like it could have been done by a fox!,Renault
It‚Äôs sort‚Äôve a Schr√∂dingers value situation,Renault
Try going 110 instead. You lose less time than you think and will do wonders for you fuel economy.,Renault
"Btw.

We found out that mine and his had more HP than original.

His did 251 with a bigger Intercooler and the rest stock

Mine did 246 HP fully Stock. 

It‚Äôs a fun wagon even from the factory!",Renault
"I hate after first few photos, but then i saw headlining. And it was good.",Renault
"Loved my coupe, sadly had to say goodbye a few years ago but still my fav of all my Renaults",Renault
Oh maybe not sure how i check that,Renault
I think a Renault dealer can program it in. I know the Irish postal service used to get the Renault Kangoo set to always have dipped lights on. Might be worth giving your local dealer a call.,Renault
Have you tried off the roof and using it like a convertible?,Renault
Yeah,Renault
"Ok.
What does it say when you activate it manually with the button?",Renault
I want a duster pickup now,Renault
"It‚Äôs awesome, where did you get the seat covers? They are mega!",Renault
"If I would see that listed for sale, I would show up with extra cash and buy some weed off you.

Clearly, you got the good shit.",Renault
"I'm not trying to offend anyone. Just show something unusual to European people, that's all",Renault
"If you have an r-link head unit on your captur, you can modify it to run android auto with a bit of work.  https://www.gps-rlink.com/r-link-1/activate-android-auto-waze-on-r-link-1/
If you have a media nav, you'll need to replace the head unit.",Renault
Surely dropping the headliner and running down the pillar would‚Äôve been better?,Renault
"They're stock wheels with a reputable tyre brand using normal caps.

They all lose pressure (checked with 2 different gauges) but 2 of them lose air a lot faster than the others, my VW Transporter with 50psi all round loses nothing ever and I check them every couple of months.

We're going to get Renault to have the tyres off at the next service.",Renault
"Type D is in a shortage. type E should be ok to use.or your local Renault may have Motrio coolant. We use that in most cars out of warranty and it's fine in older car, used it my old 2001 Megane. Renault Type E 5L: 7711947051. motrio 5L 8671017367.",Renault
Fair,Renault
"Ah crap, maybe i should've done that. If i remember correctly Dialogys wanted me to do it with the engine in :/",Renault
"Aye the front/back seat footwells and the roof are all damp like, fantastic cars but very cheap especially in the interior department",Renault
"Amazing. 

I've got a series land rover that this is absolutely going to ruin the interior of! 

Thanks!",Renault
"That's even cooler, it looks like an official Goose sticker, really good job, making me wanna doodle now but I can't doodle for shiz",Renault
" The Medianav head units have it built into the standard connectors but you need to tap into it with an adapter.

This kit comes with the adapter so the RCA input everyone is talking about will just go straight into the loom.

You will also need to tap into the reverse light wire which I will have to go and find at the weekend if you're still interested. It does require a bit of work.

Here's a listing for a camera with the adapter.

Edit. It works on every touchscreen panel the Clio came with. I originally did it on my 2014 MediaNav panel but changed to a 2018 Android Auto/Carplay panel and it still works the same with the adapter",Renault
"My Clio 2 didn‚Äôt have power steering, mine was absolute base spec 1.2",Renault
The Megane is more comfortable and quieter of course. Fuel economy should be higher due to it being heavier and have wider tires. The Clio is a car that‚Äôs ‚Äúmore fun‚Äù in the sense that it‚Äôs a smaller car and more enjoyable to have a spirited drive.,Renault
Was it not 1.2tce with cracking head?,Renault
"He maintains the vending machine in the reception, visits once a week?",Renault
Can I jump on this and ask how to do that? I didn‚Äôt know you should do that / that it was even an option.,Renault
"Montana White Brazil Yellow graffiti paint for the yellow backing! Previous owner sprayed the car, but included a couple cans with it so I know what it needs for touch ups!",Renault
Wanna know how I got these cars?,Renault
Ye those must be a blast if this little engine feels good here with no handling modifications too,Renault
Does that say CROTCH?,Renault
"And for the gears, yeah it‚Äôs an interesting one. It has electric gears also or something like that it‚Äôs a complex system that I don‚Äôt really understand that well, I‚Äôm used to regular stickshift or DSG lol",Renault
"It's not that difficult. You just need to push the connector inwards. Here's a good demonstration:

"3.0dci is not very popular, probably for a good reason. If you want to go with big diesel Audi /BMW is the only way. 3.0tdi or 3.0d are brilliant, with tons of tuning capacity. Where are you from?",Renault
Second this I have the megane 1.5 dci and my wife the 1.5 dci kadjar very frugal and a much better drive than the 1.3 we test drove. Roomy comfortable car great spec shame that the Renault network is a shambles and service/repair is a nightmare!,Renault
....why?  It's a well known brand of duct tape.,Renault
Best comment so far.,Renault
"I have the same kind of car, Clio IV GTline 0.9 TCe, but I‚Äôve paid 165¬£ road tax when I bought it last year..",Renault
Have you tried pressing and holding the power button for about 15 - 30 seconds?.this is the usual way of doing a reboot.,Renault
"Yeah, fair enough. We‚Äôre all kinda tall though, so extra (leg) room is definitely appreciated. And a sizeable trunk always comes in handy for the rare occasions we take the car to go on holidays. Although the megane estate would get that covered as well.",Renault
Yo car broken homey,Renault
Nope,Renault
No one said it. At least for diesels turbo good for over 500k km.,Renault
Good news?,Renault
Thank you very much for the kind words. I was not into cars until now that I have one and I don‚Äôt really know much about them. Why are people hating on Renault? Even more in a Renault Reddit. ü§î,Renault
"I‚Äôve had that light on, it doesn‚Äôt throw up a code, doesn‚Äôt go into limp mode, no ill effects, just popped up for an hour and went away and never came back. Petrol Clio 1.2 campus",Renault
Be at 2500 rpm and inflate your tires 2psi more than what it says on the manual.,Renault
"Ouch. The British market went up by a fair amount as well. Still, a 2011 Laguna with around 160.000km / Megane around 160.000 is about ¬£2-3k. Basically about 5-600 less of what it was in 2017. 

Coming to that engine, I wouldn't know much about it. The reasoning behind my car being a Renault, and being the ""Expression"", naturally aspirated, was that the least things it's got, the least it could go wrong. At the time I paid the 3k for the Renault, I found a full service history, all receipts included, everything ever done only in official dealerships, similar milage, auto 2.3 kompressor C class, from 2005 going for ¬£1.5k. went Renault as less things could go wrong, newer car and obviously cheaper to maintain.",Renault
You don‚Äôt suffer from migraines and it shows,Renault
"Good engines. Worth noting there's both a 75hp and a 90hp variant. In the UK anyway the 75hp ones don't have TCE badging on the back, but the 90hp ones generally do.",Renault
Congratulations! Lovely car.,Renault
"If you can't find the code you can remove the radio and use the serial number printed on top to decode the security code. If you do go down this route I should be able to decode it for you, no charge.",Renault
"They come on both at the same time, but it‚Äôs a petrol so no glow plugs, but thank you I‚Äôll investigate.",Renault
Free?? Is that in the UK?,Renault
Id recommend taking it to a rolling road rather than just getting the ecu flashed,Renault
"Astonishingly, it's brilliant. 

It should be shit. Absolute shit. But by some witchcraft it isn't.

I need to lie down.",Renault
"Im not confused, its a Dacia Duster pickup, rebadged as Renault for the south american market.",Renault
Loved the Renault M√©gane as a kid. It was my favourite. I liked the little booty the previous generation to this one had,Renault
HONK,Renault
I think the same when I see cool cars we can't have being released in Europe.,Renault
"Yes, it's the 1.4 TCe. I come from a Peugeot 206 CC 2.0-16v with the 136 bhp GTi engine, and the power-to-weight ratio is similar so for that reason, I think it's plenty fast to be fun.

I did look at the 2.0 TCe which is a lot quicker, but I was looking for a specific trim level and this was the only one on the market at the time. I'm very happy with it, though the shocks are due to be renewed and I think that's affecting the drive more than the engine is. It could be a bit more tight in corners.

Though, in all fairness, I wouldn't consider it a very sporty car in the trim and motorisation that it has. That's why when I upgraded to 18-inch alloys on this car I went for Laguna III ones, instead of the M√©gane III GT ones. I can imagine the 2.0 TCe is definitely sportier.",Renault
"Try gently playing a hair dryer or warm air gun gently over the bumper or door handles. 
This releases the chemicals in the thermo plastic items.  But don‚Äôt do it for too long or you could damage the item .  See YouTube for more how too‚Äôs.",Renault
Sounds bad ass,Renault
"Thankfully that crowd is about to die thanks to a rule change the government just announced. Double cab pick ups are no longer going to be classed as a ""works van"". If I remember correctly the end date is 2028 but that's for people already in leases.

Rejoice!",Renault
I tried to find that prior to asking here but for some reason the diagram i find dont line up. If you know where i can find a good one send me the link just circle the fuse you think is the one for the multimedia system i know its a 15a one but dont know which one,Renault
Is that sound continuous or does it appear/disappear?,Renault
Its so strange thatvI like it very much,Renault
"probably the case on a cold engine, especially diesels dont rev hugely.",Renault
"im a fan of modest but underated cars, that's why the 3.0dci brought my attention, in comparison with more expensive but reputable brands. the 3.0 dci in Laguna is the same as in Nissan Pathfinder so I thought it gotta be good. I'm from eastern EU¬†",Renault
Thanks for this. The buttons making it difficult and I can‚Äôt lift it through because the handbrake is so far up.,Renault
op have you done any performance mods to your clio?,Renault
He probably hasn't. I doubt that even crossed his mind. This idea is so genius it's literally thinking out of the box.,Renault
"Speathed pretty much covered everything but to add to the rust‚Ä¶ take the side skirts off for a good look at the sills and the rear quarter inner trims to see the inside of the sills. 

Mine looked fine just a little scabby around the jacking points but ended up needing a pair of inner and outer sills. 

Rest is all just consumables but make sure cambelt is done properly with the tool rather than bodged with tipex etc",Renault
"If I am not mistaken, this car was the most luxurious in Renault range back in the day",Renault
"I see, thank you",Renault
"Good anti-theft measures, and it adds  character",Renault
Because it‚Äôs from a car manufacturer that normally drives from the opposite side I assume,Renault
"2016, bose edition",Renault
Sweet!,Renault
Is steering realignment needed? Unsure if you can get it back in exactly the same position where it meets the wheel hub. ü§î,Renault
I'll try the clutch trick and check hoses. After that comes a new turbo. Thanks for the help!,Renault
It could depend on the camera or head unit you use but either way it's only shown for a couple of seconds after leaving reverse if you can live with that,Renault
Avoid bumps,Renault
Are you from wigan,Renault
That would actually be brilliant,Renault
"aight I'll check it out , thx for sharing¬†",Renault
"Maybe 1.2 tce had this problem as well, but I'm 100% sure that this happens in 1.4 tce engines.",Renault
"Mum, can we have a Nissan Navara?

No, we have a Nissan Navara at home

The Nissan Navara at home:",Renault
"We‚Äôre from the Netherlands. Car prices might have increased due to covid chip shortages? Or our country is just expensive‚Ä¶ We bought the Laguna 2 at 168.000km for ‚Ç¨3.500 back in 2017, and it was a 2006 model. Now a 2010 Laguna or megane costs more, even though it‚Äôs relatively older‚Ä¶

As for the 1.4 TCE: it‚Äôs been around for quite some time as well, right? I think models from 2010 were already equipped with it. Our garage says turbo‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt negatively impact longevity‚Ä¶ Even choosing the engine in a single car model is hard, haha",Renault
"All Clio II had power steering, but on the 1.2 it was electric, so that might be the issue if you've been looking for the reservoir.

Maybe your gramps pulled the fuse for it?  Or its broken.",Renault
This is the mild hybrid so it has a 1.3 tce which is a good engine,Renault
I know the Fuzzy dice are marmite but so is the car lol,Renault
The difference isn‚Äôt going to massive. Just be aware that the ride will be a bit harsher no matter what option.,Renault
The Duster pickup that we are waiting in Europe for so long for it,Renault
"Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have a link for the screen as my mechanic put it in for me but here‚Äôs the lights: Govee RGB Car LED Strip Light,... https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07QBMRQST?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share but all I‚Äôll say is to use your own double sided sticky tape",Renault
"Yeah! Ordered some tapestries off of Shein, took both front seats out and me and my girlfriend sewed them onto the seats it was actually loads of fun!",Renault
"That looks pretty smart, actually",Renault
This is a European car lol,Renault
Amazing!,Renault
"This looks awesome and I don't care if im a Brit and will literally never have a use for it, bring them over here!",Renault
"Yup same boat, same colour too but lower trim",Renault
"FEBI GLACEOL TYP D READY MIX -30 5L 26581
A local chain of shops has one with this title. Do you think its the right one?
They only have a symbolic picture so im not sure about the actual colour but its greenish yellow in the pic.",Renault
"You should ""rat"" the exterior too.  I have a little clio too and I love the stupid little thing.  They all suffer from water ingress but they're pretty reliable.",Renault
It's a good start but there's so much left in it,Renault
"It should be cheaper and have more power, i like the car (have a scenic 3 my self) but still think Tesla is overall a better car (Price + Power + Equipment + Quality)",Renault
"Last page in big manual, if that doesnt work radios been changed and dealer will need number of back of unit",Renault
EDC is double clutch maybe if you are under 150k kms or car is brand new but if you rack up the miles that thing will eat the clutches faster than a manual and its like 2k euro to get it fixed. Dont get me wrong EDC is faster shifting more comfortable but if you will comute and get to 200k I believe the manual will be cheaper to run,Renault
"Couple of years ago I bought a 2009 Laguna MK3 GT Bose edition that I've spent a fortune fixing, the first Renault approved dealer I got the work done in did a shit job that didn't fix the problem and it happened again about 13 or 14 months later and I do not regret a thing, I love how the car looks and it's so nice to drive",Renault
"Depends on the size of the tyre but for something decent maybe ¬£50-80 a tyre. Track rod end and an alignment I'd say ¬£100 max if not less. Really easy fix and you could do it yourself.

I'd just keep an eye on the support.

Edit. I know the MOT says one tyre but really id change them in pairs across the axle if you can afford it. In all likelihood the other tyres will be in similar condition if one is cracking. Used cars nearly always need new tyres from experience.",Renault
"No, there was also a 1.2 turbo version. It's essentially just a Twingo GT with Gordini plastered all over it. Very rare in the UK.",Renault
this idea is genius! why didn‚Äôt i think of this sooner?!,Renault
You had me at MF DOOM.,Renault
"Do replace the cover eventually though. It stops dirt getting into the threads, which will turn getting recovered during a breakdown into more of a faff than it needs to be right when you could use minimal faffage.",Renault
This is a fucking masterpiece,Renault
"Only alternative with more power would be a Ford Puma with 155hp for 29.000 euro, price in germany or the new dacia duster which is just a reskinned renault that will probably cost 25000 and have full hybrid tech.",Renault
" I had these randomly ligthing up for almost 2 year, and then more and more, and when it's up I can't fully accelerate.",Renault
"Nice.

275 trophy owner here. If you value driving experience these cars are fantastic, good steering feel, great handling and solid engine (remap it though).

Even with uprated sound system from the factory the stereo system is WOEFUL. If I didn‚Äôt have the fancy recaps I‚Äôd be getting an under the seat sub and amp set up for starters.",Renault
"Grab a battery charger as well - halfords do fairly cheap ones but I'd always advocate for a CTEK one who are the market leader. Plug red to positive, black to a highlighted (in manual) piece of the body in the engine bay and it'll charge (do it at the weekend). 

Do it every 3 weeks or so just to keep the battery maintained if you're doing short journeys. Super important to have a nice healthy battery and keeping it charged it'll last you!",Renault
I am not from the uk but yes,Renault
I‚Äôve got Hercules on the ceiling of my downstairs John so I can‚Äôt comment.,Renault
"Thank you! And just phone pics, the posh pic was taken at its first outing since I got enough lines on to pass it off as finished üòÇ every time I look at it I see more I want to do lmao",Renault
Push the foot brake hard,Renault
I love it! Long may you reing,Renault
"If there good access its a complete rip off.
To clean dpf you just spray ¬£30 can of foam after removing the hose which also needs replacing in your case and then go for a drive preferably after requesting regen with diagnostic software.

Someone mentioned that you need to buy pressure sensor together with the hose, but i would attempt to just replace the hose if possible, braided rubber hose wouldn't cost more than ¬£10.

¬£600 is a lot of money for couple hours of work doubt it would take more then that even if few things need to come of for access.

Cleaned dpf using foam spray on my bmw recently and there wasn't much space to work with still only took me about an hour.

The foam dpf cleaner is very effective tho might need done twice if dpf heavily clogged, but it works most of the time if there is no issues with the engine that causes dpf to clog fast in that case replacing dpf would be waste of money as it would end up clogged again.

Possible reasons for dpf to clog: faulty injectors, faulty thermostat, egr not closing properly due to soot build-up, boost leak, burning engine oil due to faulty turbo seals or piston rings.",Renault

Red carpet could be a good move... Also maybe slam it and put it on white steelies,Renault
"Make sure that the engine has been serviced regularly. These 1.5 dci have a not so uncommon connecting rod bearing failure and it can blow the engine. More than anything, look for a service record that has replaced the bearings and/or regular oil changes with the correct oil viscosity.

Other than that, electrics are a common failure point in these Renaults, see if all the windows work and door sensors",Renault
"Yeah it‚Äôs a petrol I did forget to mention that, but i‚Äôll plug into the obd and see what comes up.",Renault

I have a megane with same issue in fact mine keep falling off. Obvs poor design.,Renault
I think that‚Äôs fantastic!!!,Renault
"Milky crap under the cap is nothing to really worry about. I just used an old rag to wipe it away. I do a lot of short journeys in winter and mine has done that.

Is it doing the same thing this morning? 

I think the codes are related and there's *potentially* nothing at fault with either the throttle body or O2 sensor. Obviously there may be a fault with one of the parts but I doubt *both* are at fault.

The O2 sensor is either down the back of the engine if you look down where you removed the throttle body, or it's under the car before the cat. If it's just behind the engine, it's easy enough to check and then trace wiring to see if anything is frayed or unplugged, same with the throtttle body wiring. Clean any plugs on the wiring to and from these.

The butterfly in the throttle body should be quite stiff, it's normal. It's then actuated by cogs within the plastic covered housing. These can wear out but it's not necessarily what's happened here.

This is what I'd do before throwing parts at it:

Check the wiring and clean the connectors at the ECU and on the part. They may have some corrosion or there moisture around them. 

Put some new and fresh fuel in then clear the codes and take it for a run, if you're able. There's a process for resetting the throttle body adaptations which I can't remember exactly but you should be able to Google. Leaving the battery disconnected for half an hour might do it.

I'd also check the battery connections are clean and secure. 

If you've got a multimeter you should be able to test the throttle body and O2 sensor wiring, Youtube will be helpful - doesn't really need to be model specific to give you an idea of what to do.",Renault
I'm not even mad. That's absolute class.,Renault
"The way that the start/stop works is that it will be deactivated if the battery is on low charge or the engine is still not up to operating temperature (Which seems the case for you) 

  
I personally deactivate the feature as the majority of my trips are very short and I prefer maximising battery recharge.",Renault
She‚Äôs pretty,Renault
I do occasionally take the highway and have a short entrance ramp to it so I do have to accelerate a bit tho,Renault
Same tyres all round yes.,Renault
Fuck yeah,Renault
"Do you see the ""tel"" button? Then it has Bluetooth, different face, same internals",Renault
"Great car! Reliable and quick. Haven driven a lot of hot hatches from VAG in the past, I just love the Megane RS. Especially when one understands the Renault sport spirit. You just have to drive them on a track to understand. Its a true drivers car. 

When the Megane 3 RS came out, its competitors were arguably the Golf 6 GTI, Opel Astra OPC, Ford Focus ST, etc all understeery, opened diff, safe hot hatches. Fast and comfortable but nothing like the megane.

The Megane RS had an Independent steering axis, locking diff, 4 pot brembo brakes, a neutral setup, fully deactivatable ESP, etc. It was ahead of its time imo. Also, the 250 revs beautifully for a turbo charged engine til the hard rev limiter. 

The - electric - steering feel of the Megane is one of the best modern steerings feels that i have driven, and I have driven also modern Porsches. 

Downsides:
Its not comfortable as other hot haches of course. Cabin is noisy and even the upgraded hifi sucks hilariously.",Renault
"It was without power steering from the beginning, as /u/SpecialNose9325/ mentioned it could be option for eastern Europe market. It does not have ABS too.",Renault
"It's hard to properly test a battery. It can read a good voltage but still not produce the correct ampage. I agree with u/apworker37 that this is the most likely cause. If the battery is over 5 years old, it probably needs replacement.

That said, the best way to diagnose this issue is to get a diagnostic done at a garage (not just a yearly test).",Renault
"I will only need it for the first little bit of the journey, and the last little bit (to and from the airport about 40 mins away)",Renault

I think it's really cool mate. You've made it individual to you.,Renault
Ohh right okay thanks so it‚Äôs like resetting the current trip (mileage etc)! So I‚Äôm guessing I need to do that before I fill up the tyres? Because once they‚Äôre filled up the message goes away?,Renault

"I have a 2009 Laguna GT and the oy way the audio shop could get my Pioneer head unit to work and still power the amps was by splicing the connection from the existing head unit to the new one and relocating the original unit to my glove box, you might be a bit luckir with a slightly newer car and be able to find a wiring harness that keeps the amps alive",Renault
"You have to drive like a hooligan every once in a while. Don‚Äôt break any laws, but get a DPF cleaner, put it in the tank, keep revs high in 3rd, 4th gear for a drive on a motorway and it should do the trick.

The problem is probably the same as I had, which was a worn plastic part in the handle at the back of the button. Unfortunately the plastic parts aren't available separately from the lever, so I had to get a new lever, which was a lot for the leather covered version.

"I've got one of these as a courtesy car at the moment, and honestly I'm shocked at how good it is.

I owned a 2020 Clio 100TCE for awhile, this think is leaps and bounds above it.

The EV mode is super comfy to drive around town in, and has some decent pickup to about 30mph.

The engine is still lacking, so there's no power over 30mph. But it's a Clio, it's not built for power.

I love the new dash setup, although I find it only to be useful in the ""sport"" mode with the navigation on the left side, although it might be a configuration option I've not found.

The battery also seems to last forever. We did some blasts in it just to see what it felt like, coming from driving a Meg RS280. We drained the battery to about 1/2 after probably 10 miles of <50mph. But it very quickly was charged back to full and only used about 5 miles of fuel. I'm not sure if it uses the engine to recharge the battery whilst it's running.",Renault
You just make us envy you.,Renault
for real? so the larger 1.2 kangoo had hydraulic power steering (there is a reservoir) while the clio had electric? or was it different between the 1.2 and 1.2 16v engine options?,Renault

Megane will offer a little bit more comfort due to larger wheel base, tires also play huge role, but other than that I wouldn't expect big difference, a lot of new Renault models are built the same way, in the past Clio used to use most of the parts of the previous version of the Megane which is not the case anymore.

In the end the best way to check it yourself though, go to a dealer that is closer to the highway or some open road and test it yourself.",Renault
Dusters are branded as Renaults in South America and IIRC are assembled somewhere on that continent.

"Not sure where the text went for the post, but here it is again:

  
I took my leased car to a local car wash (drive through thing) last weekend. They failed to tell me the antennae for the radio on top of the car ""fell off"", claiming it had previously been glued on. Luckily they found it and left it in the driver's side compartment (again without telling me). They might be telling the truth about the glue, I can see there is some super glue smeared on the antennae and the bit on the car that it attaches to, I also suspect the car wash people tried to super glue it back on themselves. I just thought these things usually screw on? 

I took a look and there's no way to reattach it right now without some glue as there's nothing for it to screw into. 

Should this antennae be able to screw on? Or are Renault provided ones glued on as the car wash people tell me? 

Would it cause any damage to the car if I leave it off for now? I was thinking of leaving it off and glue it back on in 4 years when I return the car 

If I wanted to replace the antennae with something a bit smaller that is less likely to fall off what should I buy? I have no clue about these things so links would be handy.

The radio and DAB still work fine without it attached, but I don't care anyway as I never use the radio.",Renault

"Well, 2k rpm is where it‚Äôs the best economy/emission wise. It‚Äôs up to you to anticipate the need of power/torque. Don‚Äôt underrevs to the point your near stalling just because the dash says it so, it‚Äôs not good for the transmission, crankshaft nor for engine supports and annex parts fixed on the block as more vibration lower their lifespan. 
Now there‚Äôs a secret to know best where you should keep your rpm for the overall best torque-low consumption/emission (who gives a fuck about this?). Follow the max delivering torque rpm, meaning for a turboed petrol engine it‚Äôs between 1k and 2,5k (modern turbos aren‚Äôt laggy anymore as pro-ev like to say except for small engines). The HR10 90hp have a peak torque at 2750rpm. So when cruising, try to be at 2500rpm (3 cylinders often have max torque available on the higher end for a turboed engine, while 4 pots are at lower end (like mine, 1600rpm) which means they deliver faster and without having to rev high). This way, you‚Äôll have the punch when needed with little to no lag and with no higher consumption. 

Now remember, a higher rpm running engine is wearing faster than a lower rpm running one. Be it cylinders themselves and more importantly piston rings. But this only happen on highly loaded engines with people running it at 100% everytime and on long periods. Also respect engine water temperature, you should be good to attack when at the middle of your gauge (~90¬∞c), it‚Äôs a good indicator even if oil isn‚Äôt on any gauge. Always wait for the engine to be hot enough to make it roar to the sky, and wait for the turbo to be well oiled. 

For my 1.3, during regular trips, I always try to have a moment with a good straight road to play some stainless melody between 4000-6000rpm at max pedal‚Ä¶it‚Äôs enough for the engine to ""breath"" and eliminate carbon.",Renault

"If it's the same as my Megane the indicator for changing gear is pretty much going to trigger at 3k revs to go up and \~1.5 to go down, that's just standard ""eco"" shifting to be honest. 

Good to get into the habit for eco driving but it doesn't always result in the smoothest of drives.

But as I said Renaults are no different than other cars, my 2.0 Megane I used to flat foot shift, not a feature of the car but when you took it to the red line the limiter would kick in long enough for a quick gear change. Probably absolutely brutal on the clutch and gear box but the thing never skipped a beat.

My 2021 1.3 TCE Megane I have started to abuse a bit more as well and it seems to be taking it no problem. Quite like the fact that using the whole gear ratio I can get up to about 90mph by top end of 3rd. It craps out after 3rd but feels really quick in backroads and town driving.",Renault

"For improving fuel economy make sure you have a good quality oil for your engine, not only helps with better fuel economy but also with better power( i use liqui moly). check you air intake filter make sure its good and not dirty, replace it if it needs replacing, better airflow means better fuel economy( do not clean the air filter with air compressor because you will expand the filter holes and make it worse so just get a new one). Put good quality fuel in your car, it might be more expensive but it will give your car better fuel economy. These are some of the simple things you can do, you can also check your fuel injectors and spark plugs to see if they are still good if you want to take it up a step.",Renault

"No worries. Basically, the former owner fitted the wrong type of sparks. One cylinder had a spark fitted too low, so the top of it was getting knocked by the piston very slightly every time it moved up and down. This resulted in two things, firstly it bent the tip of the spark right over. Secondly it pushed the spark up the cylinder a few mm resulting in the cylinder being threaded. I had a couple of options, I could have replaced the whole top section of the engine (expensive and it's a 20 year old engine, so is it worth it etc), or I could fit a timesert (there's another similar option, helicoil I think it's called but that wasn't recommended). The original garage that fitted the TS didn't do as good as a job as they could have, so the specialist did some work to correct it.",Renault

"Parts are correct, exact match for 1.5 dci scenic. Engine mount and the central one are exact same in design with everything else. Even the color mark is same on new one (main engine mount). The transmission mount was different in design, this is one more reason why i put back the old one. Old one is without cracks btw.

I suspect i may have tighten the main engine mount while engine was supported too high with the jack. I'll try resting it on chassis with piece of wood.

It makes no sense to me why whole engine now vibrates a lot more, even if it doesn't transfer those vibrations to chassis fully, but only does it for pedals and produces the weird metal on metal knocking sounds sometimes.

I guess I'll just redo whole lot with engine less supported by jack...",Renault

In general, most non-direct injection engines do benefit somewhat from a proper run every so often, especially if they only get short, low temperature runs most of the time.

This is because you get carbon build-up on stuff.

You want to warm the oil up first. 5-10 minutes after the temp gauge shows normal working temperature (the gauge is usually coolant).

I think the H4Dt is MPI, so I'd imagine yes, winding it out every so often would be good for it.

If it were DI, my answer might be slightly different.

This vid kinda covers it:

[https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/buying-maintenance/a23778262/italian-tune-up-explained/](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/buying-maintenance/a23778262/italian-tune-up-explained/)

Engines get run at redline for extended periods during testing so redline every so often won't break it. Again, you want to get the oil warm first.

As per this, redline is around 6k:

[https://www.automobile-catalog.com/curve/2020/2984255/renault\_clio\_tce\_100\_x-tronic.html#gsc.tab=0](https://www.automobile-catalog.com/curve/2020/2984255/renault_clio_tce_100_x-tronic.html#gsc.tab=0)

Note how peak torque is around where it tells you to change up. This is worth noting for cars without the shift light.

Also of note, oil hates lots of short trips. Getting it properly up to temperature for a longer trip burns the impurities out of it.",Renault

"I have an april 2023 Dacia Duster 1.5 blue dci 115. I don‚Äôt know what the original oil in the vehicle was, but many oil selectors suggested the RN17 FE spec and it was listed on the service bulletin that a nice guy from british daciaforums extracted for me since this seems to be nowdays a top secret info (service regimen, fluids). 

So after about good 6-7 months from new, when I reached the ~10k km I decided I‚Äôd replace the first-fill oil and filter and I got original Renault branded Castrol in RN17 FE version, as per service bulletin first choice and a Purflux filter. 

It is extremely hard to read the dipstick in this engine. Something I have never experienced. But as far as I can read it I saw after some 500+ km trip and ~6k kilometers total after the oil change, that the level was under the mnimum mark on the dipstick. The original filling did not show any oil consumption after a bit more than 10k km. 

So I gues the original filling was 5w-30 RN17 spec? And the watery 0W-20 that I‚Äôve put in after oil&filter change is getting burnt(?).",Renault

The mirrors are meant to do what you describe for reversing.

To set it, you put it in reverse and set the mirror to what you want, then put it in drive and adjust again to what you want for going forward. Then press the mirror button again to deselect the mirror and the light should go out. Then repeat for the other mirror. At least that‚Äôs what they do on mine. 

If that doesn‚Äôt work, or it‚Äôs doing this behaviour when in park, it may be the setting system is faulty. Ask your dealership if that‚Äôs the case.",Renault

"The dash is programmed to maximise fuel economy at the expense of everything else.
Driving along in a lower gear isn't going to damage anything, but will use more fuel. 
Ofcourse sometimes that is desirable as it gives more throttle response, more torque at the wheels and thus better acceleration, more engine braking etc etc.

If your just cruising along at a constant speed, it makes sense to be in the highest gear it's happy in. If your accelerating up to speed or anticipating that you might need to speed up or slow down shortly, selecting a lower gear is probably a good idea.",Renault
"The 3.0 and 3.5 are only with automatic gearboxes, do you want that ? I heard that the automatic gearboxes are not so reliable. The 3.5 is the one used in nissan 350z but with some modifications to fit in the Laguna Coupe resulting in smaller power. It has the potential to be modified to output the 350z's power and with a manual gearbox.

My Laguna Coupe has the 2.0dci 180 hp and it's preety fast, the 2.0T petrol is nicer with the 205 hp, personally i would recommend you to stick to the 2.0 engines and look for a model with 4control, it's really fun and stable on fun roads.",Renault

For removing it, it's pretty simple - it's pretty much plug and play. But you'll need to get under the car I think to access. It's worth checking the voltage of it just to be sure. You might find some joy [here](https://cliosport.net/threads/intermittent-p0130.790663/)",Renault

Go around to other reputable mechanics in Renaults or ask around your friend circle on where they go for a good mechanic - good ones rely on word-of-mouth. 

There is possibly a better fix than paying more than half what the car is worth for a new gearbox. 
Renault is a good brand but you‚Äôre often better off relying on those that have experience working on them. People around me trusted the 30.000km oil change intervals recommended for my Clio mk4 and ended up with a fried DPF, bad engine wear and a harsh running engine.

"Two come to mind...

1. Fuel range is basically useless in ours. I've relied on it two times and got stuck because I ran out of fuel while the range showed 200km left. The third time it was intentional, I drove it around to prove a point to the service centre and it dies with 180km of range left... They still haven't fixed it six months later.
2. When it rains, side mirrors get stuck and refuse to open when you unlock the car. Service centre proved useless and so what I do is just double tap the button to open and close them. Works every time...

"With regular maintenance, they are a good car!

What mileage is it?

Take it on a test drive and ensure that there are no knocks etc...

If you do decide to go ahead with the purchase here are some things that I have found:

&#x200B;

1. Check the drains near the bulkhead. (Remove the plastic cowling and remove the wipers.) These clog very easily and then proceed to kill the wiper motors + rot the top of the struts and cause electrical issues. If you do decide to get one this is a **MUST**.  (4/4  that I have needed this) I can't say how important this is!
2. While you're in with the wiper motors ensure that the wiper mechanism is greased as these also seize. (2/4 of mine had this issue)
3. Check all the springs. Renaults seem to like snapping them. + Tie Rod Ends...
4. Depending on the mileage the EGR will be a mess, anything over 70k miles is going to need to be done.  3/4 of mine have needed this. (Remove it and then clean it..)
5. Rear door handles can break. Had 1/4 stopped working, thankfully the parts are cheap to fix.
6. DPF is also going to need to be done +100k for any that I've done!

The K9K is solid IF well looked after, never had any issues with injectors touch wood!

Hope this helps! :)",Renault

Usually when it has a 3/4 or full battery. I know I‚Äôve done a couple miles in deliberate EV mode but it‚Äôs done hundreds of miles in EV mode when the engine switches to it automatically.,Renault
"He's right, to a certain degree. The dash says what is the most economical and sometimes when you need to shift down (dunno for the clio, my parents' X-trail does and they both use similar tech).
The optimal RPM depends on the current situation, if you're accelerating with warm engine then 3-5K is recommended, if you're just cruising then 1.2-2K is the best.
Now the part where your father is right, you indeed need to let the engine rev out from time to time but definitely not on cold engine and avoid it when the car doesn't have at least 1K km. This will warm the engine more and the extra pressure of the fuel will help clean it a bit. Maybe for 10-15 minutes every 2-3 months is enough, preferably a bit more if it's mostly driven in town. This applies for every petrol engine but it's especially true for direct injection ones (nearly every new is). But with the turbo ones it's very important to warm it before that and do not turn off the engine immediately after sporty driving.

I think this explains it, do ask if you have questions",Renault
"It's the 'electrical problem, take it to an expert' light on the petrol models.

- Renault Oroch (at least one car imported from Brazil).

"I can only speak for the MK2. MK3 probably won't be that far off though - I just had a quick look and it does look similar. You'll need to remove the window wipers so you can remove the plastic drain cover that goes all the way along the bottom of the front window, and you might need to remove the window wiper motor to get into the centre one. As for cleaning them, I use one of [these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Flexible-Feeding-Cleaning-Brush-Drain/dp/B09Q62PLB2/ref=asc_df_B09Q62PLB2/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=570452079962&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4719336313471982456&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007383&hvtargid=pla-1653757462753&psc=1&mcid=f5ae96715054310ebf839066028d9b67), make sure it goes right to the bottom and opens the plastic flap. The flap can get sealed sometimes so even if you clear the top section of the drain, the issue still occurs towards the bottom. If there's a build up of water, you should hear and see it once you pop the device right through.   
  
Just had a thought actually, do you have a sunroof? I don't, but I believe they can cause some bad water ingress also. And it's worth checking the boot, particularly around the back window. Look for any signs of water. In the MK2 that water can flow to the passenger side footwell. There's one other place I need to check for water, which is behind any plastic on the doors. On the MK2 that's where it has the 16V badge etc. Sometimes they get loose and water can build up in the door behind them.",Renault

I inspected all 3 mounts, none are transferring vibrations to chassis, the rubber is absorbing it all.

"I know these have all been written already but no harm in telling them again;

(Also keep in mind that mine is a MK3 Estate but since it was produced towards the later half of 2012, it has the same engine as 2012 Euro 5 DPF MK4 engine, albeit having 20 less nm of torque \[88-90hp, 200nm mk3, 220nm mk4\])

1- Water drains as mentioned, regularly clean or check if they have been cleaned, really a piece of cake job you can look it up on YouTube, if you cannot find guides, I can provide one.

2- As long as you take good care of these engines, they will provide you insane amounts of mileage and fuel efficiency whilst having enough power for highway journeys and overtakes. 

3- Get GOOD tyres if you're planning on going fast on B-roads or faster than usual on the highway.

4- On my unit though, DPF and EGR has never been done or cleaned (156.xxx kms at the moment) but I'm thinking about getting the EGR cleaned or maintained the next time I service the car.

5- I've been using Motul for all the liquids (engine oil, transmission oil \[mine is a 5speed manual, its probably the same as 2012-2013 5 speed mk4 clios, coolant and brake fluid\].

6- Now I'm not 100% sure about this, but the injectors may be from Siemens or Bosch, I haven't heard about them being faulty from the factory or in high mileages, but again, could be some bad luck on your end. (Someone with the right information can correct me if I'm wrong about the injector brand)

4th was had loads more room, you could fit a regular sized bicyle upright in it. To do the same in 5th you have to remove the front wheel.

On the other hand 5th gen is way better to drive than 4th. Eventhough it's a long car, back wheels steering makes it as manoeuvrable as clio. Uprgaded lights are extremely bright and sound system is also superb.

Automatic transmission (EDC) is smooth, but it does hold you back if your drive is more spirited, there is a sport mode though, which helps with sluggishness.

1.6 dCi is enough for everyday driving, but I would recommend 2.0 if you load the whole trunk with cargo frequently (including the storage space beneath the trunk you can fit quite some cargo in it).

Consumption with 1.6 dCi (160 HP) is 6.7-7l/100 km.

"Renaults as a rule of thumb are just fine cars, they won‚Äôt set your world on fire and they will occasionally break down on you. However they are cheap and cheerful to buy, run & fix!

There are hundreds of thousands of people happily driving their Renaults around. Just enjoy it!",Renault

Looked at one for my Renault Master for a single side was ¬£84. Your best bet is to remove one and get the part number and contact your local rental service centre as these are almost impossible to find second hand or online.

"115k miles on mine and the chassis is solid. Engine shows little sign of age and averaging 65mpg in mostly town driving and 75+mpg with motorway use. Never had issues with the DPF. Suspension on mine was cactus but was in part previous owners fault and previous garages fault. Aircon needed doing but according to my local Renault dealer my issue was extremely rare. Gearbox is smooth apart from the syncros on first gear that aren't amazing but again could be previous owners driving habits and the age. No electrical issues but the fuel flap solenoid has failed. Never bothered to fix mine but it's a ¬£100 part so not expensive.

It's a mostly basic vehicle but comes with the bits you'd want. On the upside it means less goes wrong. Mine is a Dynamique version which has keyless entry (I believe it came with all models) and heated mirrors all round (including rear view which is very nice to have). Also has stop start and auto locking doors. Electric rear windows are fairly rare if that's a problem. Passenger window isn't auto close either but some guy in Europe sells a module for about ¬£50 if you want that.

With the diesel 1.5 in town I'd describe it as a relaxing car to drive because it doesn't feel like it wants to be driven fast but it can be fun on a b road. Plenty of grip and compliant there but some nice torque. Suspension is a tad firm for the current state of the roads in the UK which means plastics do creak here and there but it's not that nasty faux leather stuff (depending on spec) so I give it a pass. I'd say that the plastics do feel higher quality than other cars of similar ages that I've been in as well. I didn't like the piano black steering wheel or the seats so I replaced them with the GT line versions which are much nicer and comfier in the case of the seats. 

Decent boot space and okay rear passenger space but it is a relatively small car. There is really only one or two proper cup holders though which is the only annoyance regarding storage.

Infotainment is as expected for the age but an OEM android auto/carplay unit can be had for around ¬£300 if you can find one. You can even add a reverse camera for as little as ¬£10 and a little time changing some back end settings in the radio.

All in all a solid car and cheap to run. I'd buy another.

Edit: I will add and say that the previous owner has the wiper motor fixed and my EGR solenoid was pretty clogged when I cleaned it at around 90k miles just to echo what ComputerLord98 is saying. 

Forgot to mention that mine also has auto headlights and auto wipers too which are nice to haves. Auto wipers are sometimes slow to react and replace intermittent wiper modes so you may or may find it annoying.",Renault

no they just add horsepower because the flames propell your cad just that little bit more. to max put this horsepower make sure to spray your car red as thst adds 20hp and then add tonnes of tiny little 2 inch spoilers all over the car as you will have a lot of downtorce and every tiny spoiler adds 1hp.,Renault

"Interesting topic

It may depends oil change interval

On my older 1.5dCi 110 with oil RN720 spec I see dependency of consumption on oil age. I.e. I have deepstick on the max right after oil change, in 5k and in 8k, but on 9k I see few mm less and in 10..11k I have a half between max and min. And this is reproducible with different oil, Elf, Castrol, Motul, Orlen (all of them RN720 spec)",Renault

It should probably last more than two weeks anyway, but something might continously connect/disconnect from the key, draining the battery.",Renault

"They (the institutions you mention) are a separate entity nevertheless and are set up *for Dacia* regardless the name they bear. Of course in a way Dacias are all Renaults: Renault invested and saved the failed socialist crap company. Enabled them access to enrich their existing know-how with Renaults years of experience in normal free market economy. They set up the fascilities from the old socialist conglomerate they bought and named them as ‚Äúrenault‚Äù. But the do Dacia. 

The dynamics with the parent company isn‚Äôt always symbiotic, Dacia does their own thing within constraints of what from common bucket of parts they can use and what they can afford to create themselves. There is inner competition between the brands under the same roof and in the alliance Dacia was proud to be best performing brand regarding revenue. Others latched on Dacia. If Renault is the directing factor - why didn‚Äôt the core brand make money in the past few years? Yes, you could say that it was Renault‚Äôs strategic decision to ‚Äúcover all bases‚Äù, so in this view it is Renaults providence that they made a successful brand. But still - why was Reanault brand performing so badly in these years? Because it *was* smart they created a well functioning group and modernised the production pland and let the Dacia and its satelites (the design and engineering center) do their own thing. But as it was smart they did this it is Dacia‚Äôs own i delendent achievement they performed well. Renault had even better starting position, Dacia was a hated brand, Renault wasn‚Äôt. Renault had well established marketing and network. Dacia had to fight their way in. Yes again with Rebaults help and infrastructure. But belittling their achievement is just wrong. All their models are their own work, they are masters of frugal and functional machines and they do exceedingly well in this. Nobody is cutting Renault out of the picture, but saying Dacia is just a brand and Renault brand is behind it all is just false.",Renault
"I wish Alpine would pick up the ball and continue the brilliant line of record setting Hot hatches.
