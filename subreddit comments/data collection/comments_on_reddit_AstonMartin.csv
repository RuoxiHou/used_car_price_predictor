We were in the same situation. Ended up buying a 2019 DB11 V8 with ~10k miles with timeless warranty for 2 years. I initially wanted the V12 - but after driving them both - the V8 version felt more agile & refined. Test drive a few of them & see what you like. CPO warranty is a must imo. :),AstonMartin
If the 48v battery is low/dead the car will light up like a Xmas tree.,AstonMartin
I love the way the current vantage looks. I‚Äôm guessing you aren‚Äôt as fond of it?,AstonMartin
not sure if this helps but even some of the brand new v12 models missfire slightly at idle. once warmed up they are good so it seems to be a normal thing.,AstonMartin
Honestly it‚Äôs not even something I even noticed/paid attention to on my dbx,AstonMartin
Brilliant,AstonMartin
"In terms of cylinders per dollar, the DB9 wins. The V12 is something very special, especially these days. 

I‚Äôd take the ZF over a tiptronic any day. 

Maintenance costs lower on a DB9 and many parts can be sourced cheaply.

R8 will provide more sporty handling.",AstonMartin
"new vantage is great, safe until you can afford ;)",AstonMartin
Damn I just got quoted $380 a month for my used Lexus es350 lmao,AstonMartin
How dare you say this about such a lovely car disrespectful,AstonMartin
Also planning to reach out to Aston Martin as well.,AstonMartin
"Sorry I lumped in the DBS with the DB11, those will hit 300 to 350 new. (USD)",AstonMartin
"Haha thanks so much, really glad to hear you appreciate it :-)",AstonMartin
"The 7L Cosworth V12 makes it just as crazy as it is beautiful, too. It‚Äôs not only the best looking car, but it‚Äôs one of the most well-rounded",AstonMartin
"The answer is RAPIDE AMR, the ultimate dad car plus limited to 210 in the world and naturally aspirated V12 and arguably the best built Aston ever conceived.",AstonMartin
Mean,AstonMartin
"Why, yes, actually. It celebrates 110 years of Aston so there's only 110 of them, and they are all made of carbon fibre. It's a V12 TT with a manual. 700 horsepower. Pretty awesome, actually. It's worth every penny if you ever get to sit in or drive one.",AstonMartin
"> Under the hood should be a more powerful version of the twin-turbocharged 5.2-liter V-12 used in the DBS

Didn‚Äôt Aston say that no cars will have a V12 anymore? (Except perhaps extremely limited models like Valour)",AstonMartin
"Mechanically they can handle it fine.

Cost of operation is very expensive though, between gas and maintenance.",AstonMartin
Absolutely! I told the dealer that if they get it back in on trade in a few years I‚Äôll buy it after it‚Äôs depreciated a bit. I‚Äôd seriously consider trading in my Vanquish for this one.,AstonMartin
Are you ready to shell out at least $200k? The 2025 Vantage should be in the states by the beginning of next year,AstonMartin
Thank you. I'm supposedly on an allocation waitlist for 992.1 C4GTS but the ADM games P dealers and customers play is seriously turning me off the brand. Also not sure which direction P is going with hybridization on the 992.,AstonMartin
"Dang, never knew that.  Will try this weekend!  Thank you!",AstonMartin
Thank you for your super relevant opinion there bud.,AstonMartin
"Thank you! Of course, I'll drop you a message shortly :-)",AstonMartin
Buy a SVR F-Type,AstonMartin
Lol. On launch I thought the bright colours were garish but they've grown on me over the years and I really like this one now.,AstonMartin
"If it‚Äôs not yet the full 10 years, you could possibly extend the warranty. Mine was 4 months past the 10 years and they said if I had even been a month out they would have extended.",AstonMartin
Yes - but the rise in pulse rate every time you drive her will outweigh it all.,AstonMartin

"The previous owner had full PPF installed, so it's pretty easy to wash.  But yeah, keeping it looking clean is a challenge.",AstonMartin

You make a good points as the intake would cause the car to run lean if the ecu isn‚Äôt tuned to accommodate it,AstonMartin
Thnxx you're a hero! I'm gonna watch it right away and maybe Il go search online if there's an old cd or something anywhere. Thankyou kind stranger :),AstonMartin
EXACTLY! I‚Äôm getting down voted and belittled and told to shut up for talking the truth.,AstonMartin
There is a beautiful manual DBS for sale on Bring a Trailer:  https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2009-aston-martin-dbs-37/,AstonMartin
"The 1913 Spec is nothing to pay attention to. All it means is that this is one of the first 500 cars to be produced so it got special plaques with that logo and an extra fit and finish inspection. I don't feel like there are many items you would be losing as this vehicle is a great spec to start with. However, the 2022 models got the wireless charging pad for a phone below the center console and 2023 got extra Luxuries such as soft closing doors and Android Auto (yes, Android Auto came later than the Apple Carplay ability). I don't feel like any of those are deal breakers, it depends on if you like the car.",AstonMartin
I think it's the best looking Valkyrie I've seen so far,AstonMartin
"Yes, one of my closest friends has a 911 and I have a DB9. We both have young children (6 and under) and both fit car seats in the back seats.

Similar legroom in the cars, but the DB9 has slightly less width to fit a standard car seat. I use a WayB pico.",AstonMartin
Old School Cool,AstonMartin
The interior is mangled too. Not a nice looking example.,AstonMartin
Some might say that.   Other might say you are some one who thinks outside the box.   Is willing to try something new regardless of the cost or consequences.     Some might say you are a legend.,AstonMartin
It sure is! I was picking my car up from service and this one was in the showroom.,AstonMartin
"2009+ are exceptionally reliable (for an exotic) but you tend to pay a premium on them over the earliest models, which have a little more early run jank to them.",AstonMartin
Had the same issue with my 17 v12.. Disappeared as soon as it appeared and no issues since.,AstonMartin
"Just saw Kris Singhs story about that, was wondering the same thing",AstonMartin
"Will suggest everyone to read this Article about Valkyrie Saga.

(https://karenable.com/the-saga-of-the-aston-martin-valkyrie/)

Hope it sheds some light for those who Question about Allocations and Customers Dissatisfaction between Aston Martin. 

Imo, I think it generates loss for AM to develop a Single Valkyrie. Reminds me of LFA story how Lexus didn't profit from the Sales and Development on the LFA, Just my thoughts.",AstonMartin
"Definitely going to be swapping out the tires this spring, but I still think it‚Äôs going to be at that point of not being able to add any more power, even with great tires. Eventually I‚Äôd love to upgrade the turbos and get it up there, but I think that‚Äôs not doable without AWD if I still want to be able to drive it on normal roads. 

Why do you think the trans would be up in the cabin if the engine doesn‚Äôt get shifted forward? The torque tube is huge, looks about the same size as the trans when it comes to diameter. You don‚Äôt think the trans could fit in that same space?",AstonMartin
"The 707 literally just looks like all other crossovers at this point. None of them have any design language, but automakers just stick their grill on them and call it an Aston/Maserati/Alfa/etc. if they cost the same, I‚Äôd still go for the Range Rover yet the 707 cost three times as much lol. No off-road pedigree for Aston Martin either, compared to Range Rover. No-brainer.",AstonMartin
Very true. I've seen a few here in Ontario for the $55-$65K range. Not bad for what you get,AstonMartin
"Electrical is $$$ with AM, due to the low production numbers and the relatively low number of qualified people that know the wiring layout & idiosynchrasies - with the shrinkage of leather it could indicate being left in the sun‚Ä¶sun, temp variations between day & night, and outside humidity all lead to the component connections and associated plugs/switches/terminations all going bad. 

If you know of a really good auto electrician then they could do you a deal for time & materials or something like that but you‚Äôll be going up against it for sure. 

Just got my 10 vantage back and was handed a bull for 28k - mostly due to electrical bits and pieces (and a 10k mike service), but take one example - the drivers side window control switch - the actual switch had corroded and the only option was to rebuild (AM has a 12 month backlog of this part new), this alone was 2.5k.

I LOVE this car but you have to be prepared to part with $$$‚Äôs in the pursuit of that love.",AstonMartin
"I have owned a 2005 DB9 for 8 years and have put on 10,000 miles (35k total). For me it's a weekend / good weather car only. We have an owners club with dozens of Astons in N. Calif. and the consensus is Astons are well engineered and durable. There's no dealer in town and I have done my own oil changes using OEM filter and full synthetic. The filter on left hand drive is a PIA to get to but doable. High performance tires are expensive as you'd expect. The only actual breakage I've had is a trans oil cooling line sprung a leak which was fixed by a local hydrolics shop for about $100. Though the special trans fluid is pretty pricey ($10/qt) and putting it in isn't easy. Insurance is a bit higher than a regular car as you'd expect, but not outrageous.

All that said, it's a joy to drive, the sound and acceleration are intoxicating. And it's so beautiful. For me, nothing else quite compares.",AstonMartin
Yep. Basically paying cost for parts and fluids and having a trusted indie at $160/hr is working great for me. One of these two years of annual service was the trans and diff services and it was still this low.,AstonMartin
"As someone who wants to know more about Aston‚Äôs, could someone explain this to me?",AstonMartin
Sadly not an option at the moment ‚Äì only one unit in stock and the spec is too far from what I would like,AstonMartin
"Avoid cars with VINs @ D/C17xxx to D/C 19000. They have a tendency to throw rods, make loud knocking noises. In 1 year alone we replaced  @ 8 engines. AM does not say what the causes are but I suspect that loss of oil pressure as the oil pump drive is not keyed to the crankshaft ü´£

Also as someone incorrectly stated above, ALL AM V8s leak oil from the timing cover/cam covers. The only ones which do not are cars with VINs below D/Cx5000. Reason: the tools for the timing cover was designed only for 5000 engines. AM couldn't be stuffed to buy new tools. Also it is NOT an engine removal to repair it, can be done in situ.

Avoid the Sportshift I and II at all costs, it is shit, parts are eye watering expensive and it chews clutches. 

Things to look out for: leaking A/C condensers, leaking shocks, water entry to headlights 4000‚Ç¨ a pop, water entry to taillights, 1500‚Ç¨ a pop. Rebuilt engines from AM cost 43000‚Ç¨",AstonMartin
That‚Äôs not at all the same car.,AstonMartin
"CCB's do not provide any increase in braking or stopping power, they offer greater fade resistance.",AstonMartin
Ya lose all the green and it looks pretty dam good,AstonMartin
I own a V8 DB11 and I have owned many AMGs and the way Aston tunes its engine makes it completely a different driving experience. I love their AMG V8s and prefer them over anything Mercedes sells. Aston also makes them sound much better.,AstonMartin
Very hot.,AstonMartin
This looks beautiful to be honest.,AstonMartin
There are some things that are legit 10x.,AstonMartin
"What in the Doug Demuro is that plate hahahaha

Also hell yeah OP nice going!!",AstonMartin
So why does the Vantage have a quad exhaust but the DB12 have twin?,AstonMartin
DB12 has much more rear seat room. Here‚Äôs a hot take: a late model Rapide. It has a ZF 8HP trans and almost 600hp V12,AstonMartin
Don‚Äôt get the Sportshift. Get a manual. They are terrific cars. Set aside $5k/year for maintenance and you‚Äôll be fine.,AstonMartin
"That‚Äôs fantastic! So gorgeous!!

 I‚Äôve actually been eyeing these. 

Just worried about having them as a daily driver in Boston, given the weather and potholes.",AstonMartin
VelocityAP is popular for Aston aftermarket stuff although they seem to be more focused on the previous generation cars especially when it comes to brakes. Have you considered that generation? They‚Äôd probably be a better fit for what it sounds like you‚Äôre looking for.,AstonMartin

Personally I think the older one looks the best. More like a classic Aston. The updated version has a huge gaping grille and doesn‚Äôt quite look right in my opinion,AstonMartin
"It's fucking stupid, I'd drive it if I got a really good deal.",AstonMartin
Cheapest R8 no doubt. Those v8‚Äôs are everywhere and will be far easier to maintain.,AstonMartin
"I‚Äôve had my 2019 for a year in march, if you want a cheap supercar I personally think it‚Äôs the best car for the value, not to mention everyone thinks it‚Äôs worth way more so if your trying to ‚Äúball on a budget‚Äù it‚Äôs absolutely the best car out there. only complaint is it‚Äôs a bit quiet which can easily be fixed for a few grand by getting an aftermarket exhaust (id recommend quicksilver). I pretty much have nothing but good things to about the car",AstonMartin
"IANAL, but personally I would just ask them to take the car back and refund my money.",AstonMartin
Amazing work,AstonMartin
"That‚Äôs a V600 Roadster. Aren‚Äôt there only like 12 of those? 


(I also think it‚Äôs kinda ugly)",AstonMartin
It‚Äôs just not full production spec yet. It will just be doing some final tests and then will get rebuilt for sale at some point.,AstonMartin
No curbing for you?,AstonMartin
"Yeah, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a One 77. Looks way more like the DB11 or 12.",AstonMartin
"Yeah, you can check the clutch wear index using a good two-way scan tool like a ThinkDiag, Autel, Launch, etc. (no need for an AMDS!) but the index itself isn't necessarily easy to understand since I've seen the ranges all over the place.
A practical way is to get up to cruising speed in 5th or 6th gear (manual mode) around 1,500 RPM then put your foot down and see if the RPM increases too fast for the increase in speed.",AstonMartin
It‚Äôs Silver Blonde.,AstonMartin
"fuse burnt ,  check them",AstonMartin
"From what I gatheredt he best daily driver would be S63, technology is up to date, really comfy and extreme luxary - but in the end it would be Merc coupe for by passer.

DB11 will be definitelya looker and something that You don't see everyday, having more sporty characteristic. The ride is also well judge, atleast reviews says so. One thing that could put off is servicing cost, for good maintenance you are forced to go to the offcial dealers, Bamford's Rose (one of the best independent specialist of VH platform have a good video about it).

M8 from what I've seen is really stiff to the point, which makes it unenjoyable as a GT, on BMW formus M850i is a better choice of a GT, but then, You have to face the hardships of N63.

Continetal GT is a real piece of art, more elegant than DB11, with interior not to match- but also stiffer ride and less sporty ,as of it's 400 kg perimum over Aston.

As other comments metion, one more contedner to look at is Lexus LC, amazing car, unique and have that Lexus reliability which will not bring You headaches of smaller manufacturers + half the price of the other here.

I am at the same boat You are just ahead couple of miles, as the prices have not droped low enough for me. I am torn apart between Lexus and Aston, but DB11 looks have my heart.",AstonMartin

"I ordered a volante in Jan of 24 and was told May June delivery, I did test drive a coupe mid Jan here on the East coast of US and they also had a volante but not for test driving.

"Call Aston before you talk to a lawyer. Things get immediately adversarial when lawyers are involved.

It may be as simple as explaining it, and them gladly replacing the car. I bought a CPO Mercedes E Class a few years back and it developed an issue with the ignition electronics about a month later. I didn‚Äôt want a car with an electrical issue. Mercedes took it back immediately, no hassle.

"Might be an odd question, do you keep the vehicle on a battery maintainer? Do you see the ‚Äústart engine‚Äù message with a battery icon when you start it? I ask this because the vehicle is fitted with EARC (electronic active roll control) it uses a 48v lithium ion battery in trunk that powers electric motors on the roll bars, if the battery has ever gone low for an extended period of time and the lithium battery reached a low enough voltage it may be functioning incorrectly. This can cause a shudder type feeing while driving it can be especially felt/ heard at low speed maneuvering going over bumps. I‚Äôd suggest going back to the dealership with this information, if you can bear them again, and ask to speak to the technician and have them ride with you to point out the exact concern. 
Being a tech I can tell you the game of telephone between what you are trying to describe and what we are trying to decipher can be frustrating for both sides, if you can get it to happen in a manner that can be easily replicated to clearly show the concern it will lead to a more satisfactory outcome.

"Can‚Äôt comment on the era side of your question, but what I will say is if it‚Äôs had a hard life they aren‚Äôt difficult to repair, just costly. If there is no mechanical damage, and the repairs only need be electrical and cosmetic then you might just be able to get away with 30 k. But it would need a THOROUGH investigation and to make sure all lights, switches and functions work. 

Ask for detailed pictures of the centre console screen, video of the sat nav screen working up and down, and the dash cluster lcd all working and without damage. If these all come back ok then that‚Äôs a lot of the major electrical issues taken care of.

Also check the bladder bags from each seats lumbar support - a new bag is 1100 pounds five or take, plus the tear down and r√©installation of each seat in LABOR hours. 

Check when the brakes were last drained and fluid changed/serviced - thickened brake fluid behaves like fluid sandpaper.

FWIW, I cross-shopped 911s and AMG GTs before settling on my DB11. A lot of my decision came down to looks and rarity, to be honest. And compared to a 911 (and especially the AMG), I could justify taking the Aston‚Äôs cramped rear seats.",AstonMartin

"I have a MK7 GTI intake/downpipe/tune and 07 Vantage manual.  


There is lots of great reading out there that covers owning the car and common problems, I'd google through that but the part I want to highlight is the 07 that I have isn't really any more exciting to drive (From a sheer horsepower POV) than the GTI mine makes just over 315 which if your R is stock should be similar. The drivetrain being RWD vs AWD is going to be different, and getting the Vantage a little sideways around a corner is addicting, the sound and suspension are also phenomenal, but If you're looking for more power I'd try to get one with the 4.7L engine in it at minimum or look elsewhere depending on your goals with the car.  


The Vantage is an infinitely better driving experience than my GTI and if you're not looking for just more power I would 100% recommend it, but I kept my GTI so I can take my dogs in it or if I'm going somewhere sketchy I don't have to worry about parking it.  


I got mine inspected before purchasing just to be thorough, but I'm relatively capable of working on cars and wasn't too worried about most things as I can do the work outside major mechanical failure. I'd familiarize yourself with [Redpants.lol](https://Redpants.lol) or your closest AM dealer.",AstonMartin

"I‚Äôve even tried measuring the height of the vehicle front the ground to the arches thinking that maybe the air suspension is off a bit and the car is not on even height. And I‚Äôve tried measuring in P/N & drive with the handbrake on, I‚Äôve got different heights on each wheel, but the surface may have been a bit uneven, later I stopped on a newly paved road the height was the same all around. It‚Äôs a pit peeve of mine, because the car is really great, but the vibration is so irritating takes all the pleasure out of driving this car. With these new cars and all of the electronics in them I imagine it is a challenge to diagnose it, but when you pay significant amount of money for a car you always expect it to be exquisite. Thank you for your feedback very interesting and in-depth insight. I actually was thinking to go for a bentayga because I love my GT, but it had too much roll for my liking",AstonMartin

"Coming from Aston Sales Here. This is what I've learned:

1. Build Quality is great, just watch for the leather dash that may have shrunk due to being under direct sunlight. 
2. for lowering I would recommend springs. we had a client of ours that had his DBS lowered on springs and he loved it. plans to do it to his next dbs as well.
3. For wheels, just like others have said. Go with a reputable brand. 
4. Personally wouldn't recommend any mods that void warranty. 
5. DB11 AMR vs DBS. As much as i like the amr, dbs and its not even close imo. driven both and the DBS is still the better car. looks better too imo.",AstonMartin

"I'm probably going to be the negative one here, PLEASE get a warranty. I bought my 2020 Vantage CPO, it now has 25k miles on it, which I realize is ""high"" but it's 6k miles a year.  I have had all of the following done under warranty in my two years of ownership:

* Fuel pump, lines, filter, fuel rails & injectors all replaced (fuel pump broke and shot plastic into the injectors clogging them causing a misfire)
* Differential replaced (high pitched noise at \~75 mph, replacement is slightly better but it's a ""feature"")
* Some temperature sensor (Was causing a coolant temperate warning on cold starts)
* AC compressor & high pressure line (leaking AC meant no AC multiple times until they had the car for 2 weeks to find the issue)
* Coil packs (Aston only covered 1 as these are ""known"" to get water in them and Aston won't cover it, this part is so bad Mercedes has recalled them on their cars but Aston refuses....)
* Some control module replaced to fix the rear trickle charger port. (this is broken again on my car now I've not been bothered enough to take it in, instead I crawl through the interior to connect to the battery and charge it when it's winter)
* Rear hatch glass rattle (this has been adjusted 4 times now...)
* I'm sure I'm missing something else...

The factory extended warranty (it's not actually the factory warranty despite the branding, a third-party company manages it) can be had for a year from the dealer for $4,000 USD, and in my opinion it's worth EVERY dollar as the warranty is probably close to $50k in in 2 years.

Maintenance isn't bad beyond sh\*t breaking, the annual servicing and consumables aren't that costly.",AstonMartin

Much appreciated. I figured that was the issue,AstonMartin
"I think it sometimes has a lot to do with the model timeline and what it represented to a whole lot of people in that era.

The DB9 is iconic not just for the brand, but the people who saw it for the first time.  I mean, have you seen the way it looks, heard the way it sounded, felt the way it moved you? 

There‚Äôs something special about the DB9 over the DB11 even though by nearly all metrics the DB11 is a better car.

I think it‚Äôs the same with the E39 BMW M5 and the E60 M5. That E39 is mostly everyone‚Äôs favorite because it was unbelievable at the time (looks, sound, etc).  The E60 was outstanding too, but not as special for whatever reason.  

It‚Äôs hard to quantify feelings and emotions- You know what I mean? That‚Äôs what I think at least.",AstonMartin

"I have one. Rock solid.

In fact, I drive it significantly more than I thought I would when I first bought it because it‚Äôs proven so reliable.

I would take the car back to the dealership and ask them for a nice loaner since this is now the second time the car is back for the same issue. In the state of Georgia where I live, if the same issues is serviced 3 times unsuccessfully, and the same problem is still there, the vehicle is considered a lemon and is purchased back by Aston Martin.

If the pre face lift does not bother you from an interior standpoint it is lacking. I kept the original system but updated it with the naviks mod to upgrade the radio to have apple car play which helps the vehicle feel a lot more modern.",AstonMartin

Why it was a failure is another story, right now I am looking one as one of the best opiton for the GT cars and reviews reflect it. I believe the main issue was Mercedes infotaiment, especially the screen, which You couldn't lock away, like in VH platform cars.

"Compared to some of their even more recent designs, that G22 is something of a looker! I swear BMW is just taking the piss now. They ruined the brand when they started making FWD cars.

"I've owned **two**, my experience was different (and clearly much less troublesome) than yours. I also drive mine every day from the time the roads are clear of snow to the time the snow returns in the winter. 

There is nothing wrong with saying to put money aside per year for a rainy day / car fund, but to suggest it's several thousand in maintenance per year, you were clearly going to the dealer for the purposes of keeping a manufacturer's warranty intact and didn't have the option to use a good, qualified independent. I know, I did the brakes on my four-pot calipers in my first V8V at the dealer, and just for pads and rotors the bill came to $5,200 CAD. If I had known I could get the brakes done elsewhere, the cost of parts wouldn't have exceeded $1,000 CAD.

My maintenance bills now are much smaller that I use a good independent for servicing, and procure my own parts much of the time. There's also a good contingent of owners -- now that the cars have moved on to their second, third, fourth owners, etc. -- that are comfortable doing at least some of the maintenance themselves. There's some solid resources for DIY across the web.

As for Porsche and reliability... I mean, yeah? Heh, no shit. What *is* as robust or reliable as a Porsche 911? That said, I found the 911 Carrera S to be kind of 'meh' to drive, and the Aston gave me the fun I was looking for. Porsches are also ubiquitous where I live, so you don't get the feeling that it's something special either, you can't go to the grocery store without seeing one. Interior was miles better in the Brit too, in trim and IMO comfort. It took Porsche far too long to start appointing the 911 interior the way a car commanding a six-figure MSRP should.",AstonMartin

"What do you make of this 

So I haven‚Äôt done a ppi yet but there are a few things that concern me. if there are going to be issues there is a higher likelihood that it would be in one of the first units of a totally new car from a low volume manufacturer. With that said the carfax is odd. First owner only had it 11 months registered in both Arizona and Washington and drove it 2908 miles. First service was at 1625 at Bentley Lamborghini Scottsdale for 

‚Äúbody electrical system checked
Electrical system checked
Trim checked
Battery charging system checked
No-start/hard start condition checked‚Äù

It doesn‚Äôt say what if anything was done then 1300 miles (~3 months) later it was offered for sale in Washington where it was originally sold and was then sold the same day, 12/09/2021. it somehow went from Bellevue Washington which is right outside of Seattle and on 12/27/2021 with only 2958 miles passed emissions at a California Inspection Station. So it was sold on 12/09/2021 in Washington and ended up here in nj being titled on 5/28/2022 to the current ‚Äúowner‚Äù who also owns the dealership. Then on 10/26/23 it was listed for sale with 3730 miles. No services performed, or at least reported, besides the one in AZ.

One pittance for me though is that these designs would lend nicely to clamshell bonnets, especially when they're showing them in colours that are visible from space so the shut line is very visible. I know the prefacelift Vantage didn't have one anyway but for DB11 -> DB12 that was the one major change I thought was just a downgrade, and this does look a tad like a smaller DB12, which I hope won't lead to complaints as it did with the VH models",AstonMartin
"It‚Äôs so beautiful, even in black one of the best colours in my opinion. It‚Äôs literally my absolute dream car. Are the costs of maintenance high?",AstonMartin
"yes, with equal length headers.",AstonMartin
Cheers!,AstonMartin
Thanks! Was definitely hunting for this spec for a while.,AstonMartin
Bro I had a db7. If I could find ford parts that were used on that car it wasn‚Äôt that bad. But if I had to pay full price for Aston parts. It was definitely up to 10x,AstonMartin
You obviously have never seen the car in person.  It is absolutely stunning.,AstonMartin
"The best bet would be to try and replace the dash electronics with those of a Series 4 Lagonda, which are at least based off a C4 Corvette and quite reliable.

Nevertheless this is an absolute basket case and an extraordinarily tall order for even the most competent specialists.

For any normal person it‚Äôs a years-long endeavor with no guarantee of success.

If you‚Äôre serious about properly restoring it, the only real option would be to drop it off at Aston Martin Works with a blank check taped to the roof, and returning when they say it‚Äôs ready.

These will only appreciate and it‚Äôs not impossible to imagine good ones fetching $250k in the next decade. At which point we‚Äôll all look back on this and marvel at what a bargain could have been had.

A rebuild by AMW would guarantee pedigree also.",AstonMartin

"Last time I worked up under there there were a few pathways off to the sides, which is where the driveshaft would need to go anyways since it comes of the left of of the trans and goes forward off center, so I think I may be able to find one, but I‚Äôll check that out here in a few days and post back so pictures

Why would I need to cut the firewall to fit the gearbox? Right now the torque tube which is as large as the trans is fitted up the exact same way to the back of the motor, you don‚Äôt think the new one would sit exactly the same?

I‚Äôll have to check out the steering routing as I didn‚Äôt really think or consider that as an issue, but will look when I‚Äôm under it.",AstonMartin
"Haha loving the lipstick, there's a Conti near me that's got a very similar spec to this DB11. 

It's so aggressive to see in the mirrors, would look even meaner to see this in motion",AstonMartin
"Unfortunately it is not odd for these cars. Many people keep Astons almost as display items rather than cars. It sounds like that original service was because the battery went dead or wasn't holding the charge it should have. It also sounds like the NJ owner has just let it sit for the past year. Aside from PPI, get at least a 20 minute test drive, not just a 5 minute lap like some dealerships.

Again, Carfax might be odd compared to most cars, but for Astons this can happen all too often with limited use and history.",AstonMartin
"One of my staff has a q5 with 70k miles on it. Just spent $3k replacing the calipers and brake lines, driving home from the Audi dealer, hear a high pitch noise which has now resulted in a $5k engine out repair.",AstonMartin

"Yeppp, new era of Astons gonna rock",AstonMartin
"The DB11 is the most beautiful of all those cars. It also is more unique and has the most sense of occasion every time you drive it. Although it depends where you are - they are rarer in the US and more common in the UK. 

It also, however has the worst performance numbers of any of the above cars (except for maybe the Bentley) but you don‚Äôt buy an Aston for numbers. It also has the worst technology. The Mercedes and Bentley are more comfortable, but you sacrifice weight and handling. The DB11 V8 in sport plus is shockingly nimble and drives like 95% of a Vantage. The M8 will be the most capable in terms of driving dynamics but it also is more disconnected from a driver standpoint. It has dead steering while the DB11 has incredible chassis and steering feedback. The M8 is also a bit stiff on rough roads. 

But in terms of build quality, gorgeous leather, engine and exhaust sounds, you can‚Äôt go wrong with a DB11. It is a head turner and a great car to get into. I have a Volante, for the record. Cross shopped against all of those except the Continental because I don‚Äôt like boat cars.",AstonMartin
The rapide was not a success,AstonMartin
They aren't! An no dynamic cruise available either on this MY,AstonMartin
"Aston may have fallen to the de-cylindrification of the car business. All the makers save rolls, have removed cylinders from mainline cars and reserved the v12 for their most special models. Case in point is the BMW 760 which does not perform better than it's v8 alpina counterpart, or v8 amg 63 that is actually faster than the v12 65. It's for those who prefer 12 vs 8 cylinders.

I would think the v12 will become a collector preference vs the v8.",AstonMartin
Can you share the name of the color on the Vantage?  Stunning.,AstonMartin
Beautiful car- beautiful choice.  You‚Äôll love it. Congratulations üéâüéàüéäüçæ,AstonMartin
"No, what he means is vehicle reliability. The engine is solid as that comes from Mercedes Benz. Astons get split into two categories after the first owner. One is the winners, and the second is the lemons. An Aston Martin is either solid from the beginning and continues to run as long as it is maintained properly, or if it has electrical problems early on, those tend to continue to show up. What you should do is get as much service history as you can about the car, see if it was anything other than the 10,000 mile or yearly visit for regular maintenance, and make your decision from there.

P.S. I'm not saying all electrical repairs are a dead stop. My Rapide needed a ground wire replaced and routed, and it has been solid aside from that one time. You only need to be concerned once it is multiple visits.",AstonMartin
"I live in Southern California - I drive a Jaguar F-Type - just recently upgraded to the P575 R75 Convertible. I tested a 2020 DB11 Volante (5200 mi) and came very close to getting it - ultimately i chose 'new' vs 'pre owned' - as for the coupe vs roadster - it's the same debate with the F-Type - there are fans of both models. For me - as the driver - with lots of sunny days to enjoy the drop top - I prefer the roadster. When your driving the car you're not really seeing the profile of the car - you're seeing the road and surroundings - the convertible allows even more of a ""view"" plus the open air. Day and night - the experience with the roadster, top down - to me - is much more enjoyable. I respect those that are passionate about their coupes - just a different pov.",AstonMartin

It reminds me of what Porsche did with the 992 Turbo S, even though marketed as a sportscar, its performance and overall package = supercar to most people. Same is true with this new vantage IMO.",AstonMartin
The DB9 is never going to age. This car is perfect.,AstonMartin
"I suppose anything is negotiable, especially for customers with a good relationship with the dealer, but otherwise ‚Ä¶ no. The price is calculated to cover anything that could go wrong during the warranty period and still return some profit. 

Think of it from the dealer‚Äôs perspective: one even slightly major failure on these cars could easily eat away the entire cost of the warranty. And anyway, who are they competing against to justify dropping the price? The dealer in the next major metropolitan area hundreds of miles away?",AstonMartin

Completely agree. A near bankrupt company spending billions on a few hyper cars and a few modern vintage sports cars (whose interior is already outdated before shipping even starts) does not make any sense. Let‚Äôs improve these DBX / DBS / Vantage models first and foremost. Aston doesn‚Äôt have the runway like Bentley does,AstonMartin

are you American by any chance?,AstonMartin
right i did say this was a problem with the car industry as a whole did you not read my comment? this is just the latest iteration of it car companies are more fussed with filling up stat sheets for nerds then creating actually great cars 700 bhp is the definition of a gimmick i just didnt see this coming from Aston Martin who i thought was above all this,AstonMartin

Good call! I would totally consider one of those too but there aren‚Äôt any good examples in my market. Thanks for your reply.,AstonMartin
This is a lovely car it's one of the first editions which only 500 was made though I would go for the dbx 707 but still absolutely lovely car,AstonMartin
"I mean there is a chance these WON'T depreciate as fast as you think.  In the past, from my SEMI LIMITED knowledge of newer astons, the depreciation came from:

1. Poor reliability (has been fixed/is better/bullet proof engine/good electrical)
2. Expensive repairs (everything is expensive and we clearly aren't poor...)
3. Constant car upgrades (i.e. 300hp to 400hp) - you want 1000hp?  who does
4. tech upgrades

We are in the final era of ICE's and V8's.  What more do you want than apple car play?  The HUD that the F35's have?  What more do you want than 600 hp?

This car doesn't have a replacement unless you want self driving and touch screens... (lol)

"Nice! I bought a 992 911 GTS with a manual. 

Things to check:

The early Vantages have an old ignition coil boot design that allows water to get in. So make sure those are updated to the new design. The boots should have ridges on them. 

Early Vantages also had a weird pipe on the passenger side of the engine kinda tucked down a bit that can cause some power loss issues if it gets clogged up. It‚Äôs eliminated in newer years so try to find one that doesn‚Äôt have it. It‚Äôs like a vacuum tube. 

Other than that there are always just little Aston kinks that you‚Äôll have to get used to. Quite often I‚Äôd start the car to some warning that would instantly go away like the car wasn‚Äôt fully awake. I never had any leather issues, but my friends DB11 had leather separating on the dash. So just take a good look around to make sure nothing is pulling. And finally, enjoy it",AstonMartin
"It's all good. 

The reason I asked was, this is where that car was built. The old factory is now a shop that works on classic Aston Martin's and Lagonda's only, and from what I understand, can fabricate pretty much any part the car originally came with, in the way it was originally done. I understand it is pricey though.",AstonMartin
"Hey, can you please tell me more about its reliability and yearly maintenance costs?",AstonMartin
"No, I am not certain. I am aware it still uses the same system, but there were discussions they were supposed to be adding it as it already has the functionality necessary for Apple Carplay.",AstonMartin

"The key with the transmission is it‚Äôs horrible in ‚Äúdrive‚Äù or automatic mode.  I drive it exclusively in paddle/manual mode.   Yes the upshifts are slower than a dual clutch and give you a little kick like generations of built automatics years before.  But at the HP and torque that‚Äôs a little expected.  Sad that that it‚Äôs not a dual clutch but that‚Äôs what keeps them from being $200,000 still.  You won‚Äôt find a car near $100k with more sound, speed, heart, soul, individuality and beauty anywhere from any other brand.  When you add that up, a less than perfect transmission shift is an easy thing to look past.  üòçüòç.  Now that being said save your pennies for the 15-17‚Äô S model with the sportshift 3 as that‚Äôs the best adaptation there was.",AstonMartin

"I just wonder how it got from Washington to California for emissions and only put on 50 miles unless it was put on a transporter but why go to a Cali emissions station. Shouldn‚Äôt there be a service after the break in period? There were multiple TSBs and one major recall, shouldn‚Äôt there be a record of that work?",AstonMartin

"Traded my FT-R for my current Vantage and it‚Äôs very different. The AWD of the FT-R was amazing, and made it incredible off the line. That being said, the AMG in the Vantage and the exhaust tune is also incredible. I had mine custom tuned up to 620 HP, and it‚Äôs insane now. Totally different car.

Aston makes amazing cars. But not better than Ferrari. It seems like Aston is catching up tho and I love that. The only thing Aston has over everyone is looks. But when you look and the tech and get down to it there is no comparison between Aston and Ferrari.

"Launch Edition 2017 DB11 (Aston v12, twin turbo). Not my first Aston, so figured out a lot of stuff for myself prior. They aren't for everyone, and that's okay.

But the thought process in general is Aston Martins are a really good compromise between comfort and driving performance.  They'll get you 90+% of the way to the top tier in each category - at the same time.  They're lower-key than competitors, you can fly under the radar on the road, and most people who know what they are like them, and those who don't will still tend to think they're gorgeous.  They also make really good daily drivers, reliable, decent mileage, etc., which isn't universal among competing brands.  Zero regrets, no buyer's remorse.",AstonMartin

"The only issue I can think of is that in the Vantage, the gearbox sits at the back of the car where the 9spd wet plate clutch that's in the 707 is married to the engine. It would throw off your weight ratio. It could be cool to see it get done, though. Best of luck, friend!",AstonMartin

"Aston tech here, this is not normal. Do you recall if they replaced the 12v battery (normal car battery) or the 48v battery? 
If the 12v battery was dead long enough or never reached a sufficient charge level to charge the 48v battery it could have caused a failure of the 48v lithium ion battery which control the active roll control system with the sway bars. The lithium battery has an internal relay which will cut the battery off permanently to prevent a failure as they can be a little sensitive when reaching critically low voltage levels. If this is the case the 48v battery will need to be replaced. 
There are many other components in the system which can propagate a fault message in the cluster such as the ones you are getting. If you have another dealer that can service the vehicle I‚Äôd suggest going to them instead, otherwise bring it back in and do not accept it back without knowing it‚Äôs fixed. Personally I‚Äôve seen more issues with the 48v battery than other components but it could be the battery, active dampening control module, DC/DC converter, front or rear (or both) electronic active roll control sway bars, air suspension components such as ride height sensors, wiring, amongst other components, it does take a skilled technician usually with the assistance of Aston Martin engineers to pin point the problems on these vehicles.

i mean yeah fair enough but i mean you took the DB9‚Äôs up to 180 and the DB12 to 196 and extra 300bhp only getting you up 16mph? and you have to botch the front end to do that? shit even the 2008 DBS with 510bhp could reach 191 and i mean yeah i guess i do need to find a new brand because Aston Martin is a completely different brand then it used to be lmao,AstonMartin
Sadly it is. Not many fun driving roads around here - I just drive out east from Sarasota until I find some bends.,AstonMartin
"> Some things to have checked are the front cover, clutch life (sportshift) and subframe. 

Clutch *in general*, to be honest. While SportShift is more sensitive to a worn clutch (won't even select a gear past a certain wear point), the manual Graziano 6-speed box also has a really tall reverse gear (it's the same box as the SportShift sans the ASM bits), the engage point of the clutch is quite high in the stroke and results in owners slipping the clutch more than they intend to, and the single-plate clutch's friction material is made of cheese. A car with a clutch driven by a good driver can last a very long time (mine was still going past 50,000 KM before I did the twin-plate clutch upgrade), but one bad driver can burn out a new one before 10,000 KM.",AstonMartin
"I love solar bronze, such a good color.",AstonMartin
I had the same problem with my car. Sent it to the dealer via wheel dollies. It is a horrible problem.,AstonMartin
"The Sportshifts eat clutches for breakfast, esp. the first version. About 5 years ago a clutch & flywheel replacement cost @ 2500‚Ç¨. Now it costs 9500‚Ç¨. AM needs to recover their warranty costs ü§ê",AstonMartin
I'm at 27k and the original clutch is fine.  The aston tech I use says I should have no problem getting another 20k out if it. People ride the clutch too much....,AstonMartin
CCBs should last lifetime of car unless you track it‚Ä¶,AstonMartin
So sexy,AstonMartin
"It wasn‚Äôt a good investment in 2009, and it‚Äôs not a good investment today. Hope that helps.",AstonMartin
"Aftermarket brake pads are easy enough, I swapped ot Porterfield almost immediately because the stock ones are obnoxiously squeaky and dusty.  As for rotors I think you'll have to do some digging.  Aftermarket support just isn't all that grand for the Vantage.  VelocityAP, Quicksilver and a few other places make *some* parts, but there just isn't too much to pick from.  Luckily its a fantastic driving vehicle out of the box.  The infotainment and dealers are awful though.",AstonMartin
Thank you. Also they will last the rest of the car's life and less dust and also lighter.,AstonMartin
"That‚Äôs a ton of car for $70k. 65k miles would mean that I‚Äôd like to see a full maintenance history, and that the plugs and coils have already been done. I‚Äôd expect most other maintenance to be meticulously up to date",AstonMartin
"and find a good ‚ÄòIndy‚Äô dealer ahead of time and a place that you know you can get parts from. Like - brake and rotor at porsche is off the charts. However - Indy shops are typically much cheaper. 

Some people buy new cars to maintain good relationships.  I service all of my cars at the dealership. So / I pay more but still develop that relationship cheaper than I think buying brand new cars with the depreciation and still paying for maintenance. PCA gets me 10% off. 

Aston Martin - vantage and AM11 - 2014+ and even rapide - tend to get solid reviews from the technicians. I actually walk in and talk to the technicians. They know best which cars to avoid. I‚Äôd avoid using internet too much. 

I am definitely leaning toward an Aston ‚Ä¶ and think it‚Äôs a solid sport tourer.  It‚Äôs slower than my cars - but, speed isn‚Äôt everything anymore. It‚Äôs like driving an e36 m3 - super fun unlike my GLS. I hate it. lol.",AstonMartin
So you‚Äôre saying less visibility and less glass is for track purposes?,AstonMartin
"Traditionally, with most Astons that have had a double Tachometer (Speed and Rev counter), the Rev counter has gone counter clockwise. in the case of the DB12, the Rev counter runs clockwise. Its a miniscule change haha",AstonMartin
Looks better but still isn‚Äôt elegant and timeless like they used to be.,AstonMartin
Have you also budgeted for the running and maintenance costs?,AstonMartin
"I have! I actually sold the last brand new AMR in the States and took it to many car shows. It's a fun car. The manual is definitely electronically helped, so you won't mess up the clutch as bad, and the shifts are butter smooth if done correctly. It has the same power as normal Vantage just has some dampening differences and a bit higher torque output. I'd say it's more of a raw drivers experience than a ""dynamic"" car. The new Vantage will be much more dynamic. I can promise that. F1 does have a horsepower boost, but overall, it is still the same platform, just a few tweaks. After spending time in both you about have the same car. F1 just has a bit higher mid range speed.

But as I said, look out for a new Vantage being announced on Feb 12th, and that will have your dynamic answers :)",AstonMartin
Wait a while after they've hit dealerships and go for a used one. The depreciation will be crazy as with all Astons ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,AstonMartin
"If they did it would be an easy buy!

I‚Äôve been really eyeing a fun daily driver but leaning towards something like the Porsche Taycan because ‚Äî well ‚Äî kids. 

If there‚Äôs a variation of DB12 in that color with 4 seater, it would be incredibly popular. I know I‚Äôd happily buy one!",AstonMartin
what a gorgeous thing and great example too. supporting Doug is the cherry on top. congrats!!!,AstonMartin
"Everything I read - it‚Äôs reasonable.  But what I think is reasonable - someone else might say outrageous. At $5k/year - I think that‚Äôs fair to expect about $10k in two years.  

But I don‚Äôt get these questions. It‚Äôs not a BMW. I expect costs to be higher.  My X5 would cost around 3-4k a year on average. Nothing for a couple of years - then big bill.  

You could be surprised too. My Porsches are actually cheaper to maintain than my BMW‚Äôs and less problematic.  But I spend about $1-2k on maintenance every year to keep them in top shape.  I dont buy this whole - change oil every 10K, etc.",AstonMartin
"V600, coupe as pictured please.",AstonMartin
All of them.,AstonMartin
No thanks.,AstonMartin
and thats too far the other way i like grilles but i like REASONABLE grilles like is it too much to ask for for the grille to not take up the whole front of the car? Remember that DB9 that Aston Martin once made? The DB9 everyone universally agrees is one of the prettiest cars ever made? that didn‚Äôt have a humongous grille it had a perfectly sized grille,AstonMartin
"The V8 Vantage will be better for longevity and maintenance.  The DB9's V12 is a bit more finicky.  Overall both are very reliable for high-end sports cars.  I didn't have many issues with my Vantage the whole 4 years I owned it, and my Vanquish is already proving to be similarly robust.

The biggest problem these cars have is when people let them sit, unused, in garages.  They break when they're neglected.  Drive it regularly and do the recommended maintenance, and it'll treat you well.",AstonMartin
"They have to compete in this market, if you were shopping for a super GT part of what you're looking for is effortless power.

The Bentley Continental GT, Ferrari Roma, and Aston Martin DB12 would all be worse if they made 450hp instead of the 600+ they all make.

Don't get me wrong, lower HP cars can be insanely fun, but in a super GT car, what you're looking for is effortless power.

One of my favorite drivers cars ever made is a Lotus / Caterham Super 7 -- most barely make 180hp but will absolutely blow your tits off from a driving experience.

You might find solace looking at the products from Rolls Royce, they often don't publish horsepower or performance stats, those cars are more about the experience of moving from one place to another surrounded by peak quality.",AstonMartin
"Hahaha! That would be pretty funny. I know the folks that bought the supposed ‚Äúlast‚Äù V12 cars will be sad about lost rarity or value. The way I see it though, the more V12 Astons, the better.",AstonMartin
"Yes the relative ease of maintenance definitely makes the S63 appealing‚Ä¶ I wish I lived in a climate that would make a volante a more viable choice, but Canada so üòû.",AstonMartin
"Yep, that's it!",AstonMartin
yes hes literally stated in several episodes that some cars have too much power even though hes associated with POWER hes said that many cars simply have too much power he also said that this car was rubbish in his review of it so i wouldnt really be using him as an example if you want to defend this car,AstonMartin
"Seems like an unpopular opinion around here, but I prefer the simplicity and clean lines of this Vantage over the new one, including the headlights.",AstonMartin
"I did notice the air was cold, but it was also set to low (AC off) and about 60F (15.6C) outside, but even when turned up to 70F (19C) I didn‚Äôt notice much difference. 
City driving did bring up the engine temp though, I assume I‚Äôm revving up a lot more doing that",AstonMartin

Exclusive automotive group?,AstonMartin
"We had a 1913 edition.  The only reason we don't still have it is the dealer made us a deal we couldn't refuse, so now we have a 707.

The DBX is a great car to drive -- good room, good storage, amazing power and handling.

Yes, the infotainment system is slightly dated (meaning you control it with the older Mercedes click-wheel rather than a touch screen).

There is no problem connecting your phone to it via bluetooth for calls/music, despite what someone said below.

The electronics are actually pretty good except for no Android Auto/Car Play and no touch screen.  There are tons of options you can set about all sorts of things, whether climate or sound or even the driving modes of the car.  Getting to set up an individual driving mode where you can, say, pick a super aggressive exhaust note, an aggressive (but not super aggressive) suspension setup, mild shift points for comfort, etc. is pretty awesome.

The one you are looking at has low miles, and assuming your PPI comes out just fine and you know the service history of the car, I suspect you'll love every minute of it.",AstonMartin

Thank you for all of your detailed responses. Pretty much what I wanted to hear. Hopefully I will be posting here with my purchase soon. Happy holidays :),AstonMartin

"The point is it's just a still vantage with a factory body kit, that's why I called it a 400k car. There's basically no other differences than custom panels.

Q will basically do anything you want to a car at those price points, even customize body panels. I saw a superlegera at my local AM dealer that had custom rear panels and completely custom badging, all done at the factory by Q. 

Not one of those cars has sold for anything close to the 1.4m they were sold for (one was listed with just 2000 miles on the clock for 500-700k at auction) and actually the body kit is a problem becuase if you damage say the front bumper, you have to replace the entire front quarter of the car. A fender bender is going to cost $100K+ not least because they don't have parts for these and would have to be custom made.",AstonMartin

"I sold my 2019 vantage with 33k miles on it. I never had a single issue engine wise. Really the only problem I had was a bad window regulator. Dealers and Aston support are a joke and maintenance prices are outrageous. However, it‚Äôs a very easy car to work on yourself. Oil changes take minutes.  The only thing you‚Äôre going to lose with more mileage is value (not that the Aston‚Äôs hold that anyway) but as far as reliability, never a single issue. I tracked, rallied, road tripped and did 1/2 mile drags in my vantage without a single hiccup. 

It is a fantastic car and probably the only car I‚Äôve owned that I miss. If you end up buying one, you won‚Äôt regret it.",AstonMartin

look Aston Martin clearly dont care THAT much about old values because Aston Martin USED to be about refinement and being suave basically James Bond personified this car looks more like Rocky Balboa than Sean Connery Aston‚Äôs arent Ferrari‚Äôs and they arent Lamborghini‚Äôs 700 bhp is a stupid amount of power in any car especially one thats supposedly a grand tourer and not even a supercar if this was the DBS or Vanquish i‚Äôd get it because thats meant to be a proper supercar but its the DB12 meant to take you from London to Monaco not set a lap record im not saying only give it 300 bhp but 700 is ridiculous when in reality you could never or even would want to use all that power the DB9 had 410bhp and no one was calling that slow even today,AstonMartin
Save your money and buy a DBX,AstonMartin
"""radical new look"" then goes on to explain how most components resembles that of previous Astons...

Parts and instructions are hard to come by, but it generally is a very easy car to work on. Nearly every bolt is 10mm. Oil changes take 10 minutes. But parts are expensive. Dealer prices are even more outrageous and aren‚Äôt helpful in the slightest. As long as you understand those going in, I can‚Äôt say enough about how good the car itself is. The brand, the dealers, their poor f1 showing is all just noise.",AstonMartin
"Again, there are no issues with visibility. The mirrors are much bigger to make up for the less glass. Slimming a design down and making it more aerodynamic is fantastic track purposes. Hence why Aston has been so successful in the many series it races in.",AstonMartin
"Aston tech here. I recommend the DBX all the way, if you find one traded in and low mileage you can get one in that price range, they‚Äôre great space wise and still handle well in harsher driving conditions. Those AMG motors are great if you keep up the maintenance on them so 12k miles a year would be no problem for it. Only downside is like all other Astons, you can get some quirky electrical issues. Just make sure you keep it on a battery tender if you‚Äôre not driving it, low voltage on these cars can definitely make it do odd things.",AstonMartin

V8 Vantage with a 3 pedal manual (sportshift is the transmission that eats clutches) or an early DB9 are your best bets for cheap/reliable. Early rapide also probably works but I don't like those personally.,AstonMartin

"Presenting door handles are a convenience that Aston added to the DB12 and is an option carried over to Vantage. When you unlock the car via the key or when you push on the front of the handle, the handle will hold itself out, making it easier to grab and gain access to the car. It's not a necessity but some people have enjoyed it!",AstonMartin
Actually I think it just means it‚Äôs a V12. The V8 has two less vents,AstonMartin
Not in particular but maybe another additional 8-10k,AstonMartin
"Take Demuro's write up with a big grain of salt, his prices are worst-case scenario numbers, and even he admits that a good independent mechanic could have done the work cheaper.

"No, I don‚Äôt think the DB7‚Äôs will recover that much as they weren‚Äôt a great period style wise or performance. 

The DB9 (and that generation of vantages, vanquish, volantes etc) were heralded as a turning point both in terms of design but also Aston Martin‚Äôs fortunes - it literally turned the company around and put Aston back in the map as a serious class contender. They were hailed by critics and backs and instant hit (not so with the db7). 

They sold nearly 17,000 DB9‚Äôs as opposed to a total of just under 7000 db7‚Äôs. Also the DB7‚Äôs most powerful car was around 425bhp (even for v12) and there wasn‚Äôt a single model variant that did 0-60 in under 5.1 seconds. The DB9 generation went as high as 540bhp and were by all accounts much faster cars. 

Another reason for them being coveted is that unlike the DB7, the DB9 (albeit with heavily modified cars) had proven rave success winning various prestigious races. 

Finally the DB9 generation were designed by celebrated names / hall of fame car designers so that adds some prestige. 

There‚Äôs a whole bunch of other detailed technical points but the simple reasons are that the DB7‚Äôs weren‚Äôt popular, nor a timeless classy design or that powerful, what came next hit all those metrics, which has further put downward pressure on DB7‚Äôs prices.",AstonMartin

"Have a PPI done by an indie mechanic if buying locally. If buying from far away, take a cheap flight to check it out in person. From either inspection, If you have any doubts as to the care and condition of the car, then find another. 

While these cars love to be driven, you can also find really low mileage ones that look basically brand new and cost 35-40% of the price they were when new. Bamford Rose rates the engines are good to 150k miles, but naturally other components might wear out sooner. In short, you can find a car that was $200k new for $60k and it still has 120k miles left in it. 

Read the e-book on Gaydon era Aston Martin by Grant Neal. I read it cover to cover which helped me find the perfect car for what I was looking for. Of particular note is the expert opinion that the ZF 6 speed automatic is vastly preferable for the character of the DB9, while still being fast to shift, blipping on downshifts, and smooth as butter. Once you also notice that manual DB9s cost a 20k premium over automatics, this info helps your decision.  

Buy only a color combination that you absolutely love. And once you have it, drive it everywhere - it makes every drive and destination feel like experience. We‚Äôve taken some weekends away at resorts and lodges and there‚Äôs nothing like having the valet pull up and say ‚Äúthe Aston Martin?‚Äù

"Well, I know in a DB11 it's under the back seat. So at least in that generation  of car they try to put it in a similar place. I haven't looked closely at a new Vantage, but I assume you're saying there isn't a parcel shelf like in the precious gen. So is there a panel in the trunk area (probably closer to the passenger compartment) that lifts up to reveal a battery?",AstonMartin

Congrats!,AstonMartin
"Maybe later on someone who had something to do with this cars will get You a better answer, but until then let me get You my piece, as someone who is looking at DB11 right now.

Most often V8 should be more reliable, it Merc unit which was put in multiple Mercedes vehicles and generally is found reliable, but because of it will depreciate more as someone can buy C class with the same engine, on top of this from what I see V8 was more popular option especially later on in the prodcution.   
  
Performance wise V8 balances with V12 as it cuts down nearly 100kg from the car, and fuel economy should be just slightly better (highway 22 to 24).

From V12 suffers from standard V12 issues, and has some minor issues, but not catastrophic. I personally prefer idea of DB11 with V12 espcially that DB12 does not offer one.

Issue with maintenance is that with Merc era the softwear for servicing is allgedly really expensive that independents does not want to touch it. If You want to have proper serivce You are forced to go to AM official service and it will cost You nearly the same.",AstonMartin

"Power Beauty Soul baby

In all seriousness I think AM is trying to hit an intersection of luxury/sportiness/style with a focus on class and taste that other manufacturers don't target. Lambo/McLaren/Ferrari are very flashy and compromised when touring, Porsche is down-market and much more common (even if the engineering is better) and Rolls/Bentley/Maybach aren't drivers cars in the same way an Aston is

If you want an experience that is sporty but not compromised, luxurious but still exciting, exclusive but still classy and tasteful, Astons are for you. At least that's why they are for me :)",AstonMartin
I also do sales but at Aston Beverly Hills and all of our DB12's are at MSRP. Cant imagine anyone doing over sticker on these cars. not enough demand. i believe what he was referring to was the average msrp of these cars after optioned.,AstonMartin

"Given how few Aston dealerships we have in the US (there's one 20 miles from me. The next closest one is 800 miles away) and how unusual they are here and that most of the DB12s are ordered, I don't think there's going to be a lot of ""returns"".

"My guess is to pull this off, you're going to have to spend the equivalent of another Vantage. A few things I can think off is the positioning of the engine. It's basically a front mid, behind the front axles. This alone is going to be a world of pain to resolve. Not impossible but probably a start from scratch, custom-everything redo. Just take a look at the DBX engine bay vs yours. Then you're going to have to account for the fit of the transmission once the engine is placed. Honestly, it's all probably not worth it, by a Huracan for the money.",AstonMartin

S63: Yawn. Yeah, it runs, it works, it‚Äôs quiet and comfy. Yawn. 

Aston: Everyone loves an Aston. It‚Äôs universal. Rare, pretty and will always make you smile as you drive it. The DB11 has the Merc AMG engine so don‚Äôt expect an old-school Aston exhaust like a V12 behaves. It‚Äôs very good, not greatness. Good blend of comfort/sportiness. 

AMG-GT: Also very nice but with a very, I mean very, stiff ride the wives will hate‚Äîsame with any 911 Porsche.

I had one problem with the ignition which was annoying for several months and I removed the ignition dock, cleaned and lubed it which didn‚Äôt fix it, but magically cleared up after I asked the dealer to look at it a second time. 

The only other thing I‚Äôve had to tinker with is the fuel cap release mechanism (it‚Äôs known they stick and you have to adjust them to get it to pop open correctly) and I need to fix the condensation issue in the real tail lights with a $20 kit I bought from red pants. The only other thing was boot lift strut mounts have a design flaw but the dealer I bought it off, got the parts for me for free and I had them installed in under an hour. 

Other than that, there‚Äôs been nothing.  I spend way more time maintaining my other cars.",AstonMartin

I‚Äôd say that the v8 is maybe a bit more aggressive for busy highway runs. Switching lanes and punching it. It‚Äôs a little more aggressive feeling. But the v12 pulls for days. It seems like it always has more power to give. 

The v12 is great for a long highway drive (twisty road if you can find one). I enjoy it way more although I‚Äôll be honest that I drive more aggressively in a v8 or even 6. 

We have a bmw with the i6 500hp that I drive aggressively with and I think it‚Äôs because of the engine revs. In a 6 or 8 you‚Äôll be in the higher revs more often. 

In an 8 or 6 it‚Äôs like you‚Äôll hear the engine rev high. Gears switch. Rev high. Then look down, you‚Äôre doing 105. 

In the v12 you look down and 135. 

So I tend not to push it the same way.

"Im going to say unless you want it to be a stripped out tube frame race car, with a vantage body its not possible, it would be easier to convert a DBX into a Vantage.

1) The engine sits higher in the DBX as the front gearbox and drive shafts go under the engine. So the engine will be sticking massively out of the bonnet.


2) There is no pathway for front driveshafts to the wheels. Would need new strut towers, struts, uprights, brakes, wheels etc.


3) Would need to cut into the firewall and therfore get rid of the whole interior to fit the gearbox.


4) would need all new steering routing as the gearbox, engine, driveshafts etc will all be in the way.

i‚Äôd argue the E60 is more special then the E39 because of that V10,AstonMartin
eh the grille was still too big in person,AstonMartin
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll have something in store for the DBS replacement. Would be a waste of the R&D they‚Äôve done to only use it for their limited production cars.,AstonMartin
What a machine. Beautiful thing,AstonMartin
It‚Äôs sexy AF.  Aston‚Äôs interior center consoles have been shit for a while.  This changes all of that,AstonMartin
"You mean like a jet fighter cockpit, which was one of the inspirations for the design. I have clients of all sizes and have driven plenty myself and have never had an issue. The seats raise up for a reason. Why would you want to rest your arm on the windowsill when there is an arm rest on the door?",AstonMartin
"I agree with the above. If you want a true sports car: Vantage. If you want a true grand tourer that you can comfortably take on longer trips: DB11. And if you are like me, and probably most owners, I‚Äôm sure that even on a track I could not take my DB to its full potential, so the extra track performance of the Vantage would be wasted on me. FWIW, I agonized over my decision between a Vantage and DB9. I‚Äôve had my DB9 just over two years now and haven‚Äôt regretted my decision even once.",AstonMartin
"For my control arms to stop making noise, and for the oxygen sensors to do their job.",AstonMartin
"You are completely right! Sorry for the wrong post just did a couple quick searches and it was popping up as the 707!
Sorry again!",AstonMartin
"I thought you meant you bought a dog shelf.   You bought the whole car.

Very nice.",AstonMartin
"Interesting, this same spec (probably the same car!) has been regularly street parked in Ballston along with a green DBX for about 1.5 months.",AstonMartin
"No, the only statement on V12s was that the most recent V12 vantage was the last V12 vantage, not that the V12 in total was going.",AstonMartin
They nailed the new Aston look here (DB12 and vantage) IMHO,AstonMartin
Incredible -- you are super talented.,AstonMartin
I didn‚Äôt even see the Vulcan. That‚Äôs how special the one-77 is lol,AstonMartin
I'm not sure how that would be possible with that new console layout.,AstonMartin
All the current Astons (other than DBX and probably Valkyrie) are made at Gaydon as well. What you're referring to are the VH platform cars.,AstonMartin
"I agree with you, and I'm kind of surprised and disappointed with the comments and down votes you got for a legitimate opinion.  It feels like a TESLA sub.",AstonMartin
It‚Äôs limited too. 350 - 400 units only,AstonMartin
üòÇ,AstonMartin
"People get way too hung up on the sports car/supercar thing. I remember reading a thing on the McLaren 540C, where the reviewer said that it both looks and goes like a supercar, yet inexplicably, it didn‚Äôt count as one. Just seems silly.",AstonMartin
"I am off to the factory in Feb, pre-launch. No photos allowed, but I will report back üëç",AstonMartin
They should be able to call in a specialist from AM since they have acknowledged there is something going on but can't fully diagnose it.,AstonMartin
It‚Äôs behind a panel behind the passenger seat. Just pull up form the bottom.,AstonMartin
"Nice. Got to sit in and play with the infotainment on one of the launch cars (not sure if that's what it was called, but it was the one that was here when the had the party for potential clients and started taking orders). Sales guy had folded the mirrors (what a silly way for them to fold) and couldn't figure out how to unfold them. We chalked it up to a preproduction software glitch.",AstonMartin
Yes.,AstonMartin
Thank you.,AstonMartin
"Ha! Seriously?! That‚Äôs funny, because I did think it felt nice under my elbow.",AstonMartin
"I‚Äôd say the warning is likely related to low voltage.  The transaxle is all the way in the back and not likely to take a hit on a large speed bump.  The noise you describe, however does sound concerning.  I would get it on a lift at the dealer and have them show you as they check for damage and scan it to see what the fault code is for.",AstonMartin
Aston usually does not markup on their standard models. If you custom spec it takes about 3 months and you‚Äôll pay sticker price. If you buy from a dealer‚Äôs inventory the price is negotiable.,AstonMartin
Is this for US pricing? Because id be interested in this as well.,AstonMartin
"Looks like some of it (I.e. dash) was already partially harvested. Also looks like it has serous water damage. 

That‚Äôs a $100k restoration for a car that‚Äôs maybe worth $150k in mint condition.",AstonMartin
"Many Aston martins have PPF from the factory. My vantage does too. 

Take it to any body shop or pro PPF place and they will be able to tell you if it‚Äôs a paint defect or PPF",AstonMartin
"Nice, we just got a satin black one with bronze wheels that looks very tuff.",AstonMartin
Once you factor in maintenance? Very.,AstonMartin
"They're just inverted from what we use in the US. $32,960.00 or ‚Ç¨32.960,00 - just as an example, obviously the currencies are not 1:1.",AstonMartin
After a small bit of research it should be at 1.75million DKK for the normal hardtop version :) Guess more around 1.9 (?) for the Volante version?,AstonMartin
On the V8 the clutch can be replaced with what is basically the design used by the V12 which doesn‚Äôt suffer from those issues. Only the V12S has the dogleg. The original V12 and all of the manual V8s of that generation are conventional 6 speeds. There are good CarPlay retrofits as well if you care about that sort of thing. But yes the new ones are more modern for sure they just don‚Äôt have nearly the level of aftermarket support. Maybe in a few more years there will be more options for them but it‚Äôs hard to say.,AstonMartin
"Is he not getting his anymore then?

edit, he has just reposted Kris story",AstonMartin
If only they had released it as the updated vantage instead of the limited run.,AstonMartin
I think I have a spare (I thought I was going to be able to fill both sides. It doesn't fit like that.) if you pm me I can check this weekend that I didn't already sell it,AstonMartin
I looked at a Volante but the coupe in my view was a better GT car. When in the UK could I go with the hood down? 2 days a year? haha,AstonMartin
This thing is SICK!,AstonMartin
It cost me less than $1500 per year to maintain mine for 4 years.,AstonMartin
This allowed in Kuwait?,AstonMartin
Boogie woogie woogie,AstonMartin
"The noise a GT8 makes is truly something to behold, I'm surprised they let them on many tracks they are that loud. I'd pick one over the GT12 any day, one of my favourite astons ever.",AstonMartin
"Not sure if your search has moved forward, but after driving many Vantage and DBs back to back, I'm actually pulling the trigger on a V12 DB11. Realize this goes against what was posted above, but the allure of the engine and its endless pulling power along with the kind of dual-persona of the DB won me over. While it won't be as quick as the Vantage, it's quite when you want and raucous when it's fun time. I also haven't owned a V12 yet in life, so as these dinosaur mills go away, figured nows the time. 

Good luck in your search!",AstonMartin
Believe it was changed around the Virage (2012),AstonMartin
omg it looks so nice,AstonMartin
"I hope you enjoy the photo, I absolutely love driving it.",AstonMartin
It‚Äôs more like a 911 turbo vs a Panamera Turbo,AstonMartin
"EPS is supposed to be a negative number, right?",AstonMartin
"Literally undriveable 

Although all the newer next gen astons don't have the anti-clockwise tach as well, it died out with the Gaydon era astons",AstonMartin

I think the amount of money they make from charging god knows how much for a couple of letters is more than enough for them to keep throwing subtitles on their cars haha,AstonMartin
"im getting a vantage as a gift from my family, havent got one yet lol",AstonMartin
Eeeeveryone wants to see the engine,AstonMartin
I was talking to a guy on insta who is friends with a guy in Europe and apparently their customer service is terrible,AstonMartin
"DBX is bespoke, range rovers are all over the road in lower trims/older models",AstonMartin
"I know someone that went to the sales meeting in LA where the actual car was shown and discussed privately. They weren't allowed to take pictures but they summarized the changes as larger headlights, traditional hood, house built DB12 infotainment, and a bump in HP to 658. We'll see how close this is on the 12th.",AstonMartin
"Ground clearance is actually very very good for a performance car. Rarely gets caught on a speedbump, usually only if you‚Äôre going a bit too fast or it‚Äôs a rough landing (pothole etc). Even then it only hits the plastic protector which sits an inch or more below the front of the car",AstonMartin
Auto correct is wrong cats eh not bad although prone to shit the bed like they're my abusive partner,AstonMartin
Well there wasn't and I don't think any Aston has had rear wheel steering. Its a bummer because it gives the DBX a bigger turning circle than all the competition.,AstonMartin
"Nice pick-up! Do you actually plan on driving it in the winter? Looks like it doesn't have the carbon fiber front and rear bits, so at least there's less risk to something *really* expensive getting damaged, but still.  
  
I'd be more likely to get it loaded in a covered trailer to take it to my garage.",AstonMartin
"well I disagree on the styling of the DB12, that thing is a masterpiece grill and all.

but modern cars require way more cooling capacity than older cars did.  that car is squeezing nearly 700bhp out of 4L, that generates a ton of heat.  The ZF8 trans built to handle the 800ftlbs of torque is generating a ton of heat as well. We ask for lots of luxury and quiet on the interior, that requires insulation further trapping the heat.

the only effective way to cool these cars is with radiators and heat exchangers, those require air to pass over them to be effective, a larger grill makes that easier",AstonMartin
Man I love Astons. One day!,AstonMartin
"So tell me what you think of this given what you have said

I haven‚Äôt done a ppi yet but there are a few things that concern me. if there are going to be issues there is a higher likelihood that it would be in one of the first units of a totally new car from a low volume manufacturer. With that said the carfax is odd. First owner only had it 11 months registered in both Arizona and Washington and drove it 2908 miles. First service was at 1625 at Bentley Lamborghini Scottsdale for 

‚Äúbody electrical system checked
Electrical system checked
Trim checked
Battery charging system checked
No-start/hard start condition checked‚Äù

It doesn‚Äôt say what if anything was done then 1300 miles (~3 months) later it was offered for sale in Washington where it was originally sold and was then sold the same day, 12/09/2021. it somehow went from Bellevue Washington which is right outside of Seattle and on 12/27/2021 with only 2958 miles passed emissions at a California Inspection Station. So it was sold on 12/09/2021 in Washington and ended up here in nj being titled on 5/28/2022 to the current ‚Äúowner‚Äù who also owns the dealership. Then on 10/26/23 it was listed for sale with 3730 miles. No services performed, or at least reported, besides the one in AZ. 
Does that seem like an odd carfax?",AstonMartin
"Your DB11 looks awesome!!! At first, when I saw purple DB12, I was skeptical. Then I opened the link. WOW! That looks stunning.",AstonMartin
"When someone says older Rapide, I think of the Lagonda Rapide.",AstonMartin
"AMG GT is definitely an amazing car, I‚Äôm just not sure about having only the 2 seats‚Ä¶ no kids at the moment, but have aging parents and relatives etc. that may want to come along for a ride every now and again. Thanks for the input!",AstonMartin
"Woah woah, what? Had CarPlay installed by your dealer? Is that an option?? And how is it?",AstonMartin
My second guess was around the time the keys were changed and the interior refresh was done... 2009 or so?,AstonMartin
90% sure that's plasma blue boss. Royal Indigo looks purple,AstonMartin
I‚Äôm curious what others use for UV protectant on the leather dash.,AstonMartin
yeah im all for that but this is so egregious it pushes me to the other side,AstonMartin
Too bright for oyster silver?,AstonMartin
"This makes sense, definitely wouldn‚Äôt want to spend all that on the can and then not have the proper resources to the care of the car I spend money on would be the worst thing.",AstonMartin
What about Celeste Blue?,AstonMartin
It's possible! Get a good inspection done with a trusted mechanic!,AstonMartin
I personally like the late model continental GTs and the DB11. The S63 is a compelling choice as well for overall maintenance availability. In volante form I‚Äôd take the DB11 hands down.,AstonMartin
They are a ridiculous bargain now.,AstonMartin
Good feedback. I too can‚Äôt stand the shut lines. Not sure why but they seem to be commonplace.,AstonMartin
Gets taken off in a few weeks,AstonMartin
Virage would be a great choice,AstonMartin
Thanks.  Do you have a AM?  Something on order?,AstonMartin
"This is awesome. 

Any rumors on if there will be a new DBS?",AstonMartin
Harry is by far my favourite ‚Äúcar YouTuber‚Äù. Something nice about a older more sophisticated reviewer,AstonMartin
"Clutch is an expensive job on the Astons because of the transaxle design (most of the driveline has to be removed to replace it).

With only 5k miles you have basically a new clutch there. I wouldn't bother to replace it unless you really can't stand the heavy feel. I also have an 06 V8V and personally don't think it's that bad for a GT car, all the control weights on the V8V are on the heavier side (steering, clutch, shifter) and that consistency of weighting is a benefit not a drawback imo.",AstonMartin
What a beauty. Good luck with the rebuild! Should be a cracker when it's done.,AstonMartin
"Sheesh, looks like OKC is where the AMs are",AstonMartin
"Stunning car, but the green Nike symbol on the side isn't for me. I love everything else about it though.",AstonMartin
"Yes, I def should have formulated it in a different way.",AstonMartin
The most perfect answer.,AstonMartin
That looks like it might be outside of Star Motor Cars down in H-Town!,AstonMartin
"That was an M5 CS btw.. slightly different proposition

I don't know why you're being downvoted though. OP is considering an M8 which is quite literally (give or take) a two door F90 M5 with a slightly different interior. 

Although personally provided I'm not in North America  for me it'd be a B5 (especially in touring form) if it's being used as a GT. Subtler, comfier, better appointed and more practical",AstonMartin
At 72‚Äù wide you‚Äôd have 6‚Äù of clearance total or 3‚Äù on either side. You might want to re-measure your garage width. You can‚Äôt even shimmy down the side of the car and climb in the window with 3‚Äù.,AstonMartin

Nah. The Valkyrie is very underwhelming.,AstonMartin
Beauty!,AstonMartin
"Db12 is rear is wider than Db11. Looks almost the same, but sidebody is wider.


Same will happen to Vantage. Widebody was introduced in V12 Vantage, new sills, wider rear and different bumper than V8 Vantage. New Vantage will have wider body as standard. Check that first render, you can easily see it.",AstonMartin
Any car sold in the USA has been tested and has to conform to all giant list of standards especially safety devices such as head and tail lights.,AstonMartin
How do you differentiate later and earlier models based on the vents?,AstonMartin
"I work at an Aston dealer, I‚Äôve driven many of the db12‚Äôs . They are amazing driving cars, very fast, not loud but they have a really great roar to them. And very sharp in handling compared to all the other cars. Vantage, db11, dbs, dbx, and the 707. That being said, there are some drawbacks. The quality is there but it‚Äôs not perfect, the rear is the same as the db11(still looks great) and if you‚Äôve never seen them in person or driven one, I think your opinion would change drastically. I feel Aston‚Äôs have always been beautiful cars, I see your point on the big grills like bmw but that‚Äôs the way new cars are moving now. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",AstonMartin
"No, the new amg gt is a 2 door and looks like a 911",AstonMartin
Oh man I would love a cabin. In the 1950s they used to cost about the same as a mid-priced SUV (after adjusting for inflation). Now they cost $800k.,AstonMartin
"This is one of the coolest AM's IMO. Not the prettiest or nicest, but just really cool and mean looking.  

Your uncle must have been a cool dude!",AstonMartin
Seems like longer than 3 months. I know someone here in Seattle who ordered in Aug or Sept and I think they were expecting early spring delivery. And I seem to recall hearing about $350k,AstonMartin
Thank you.  I‚Äôd love that.,AstonMartin
"Closest shop like that to me is about 2 1/2 hrs, no one else would touch any Aston. I know a lot of mechanics too and have asked around to no avail.",AstonMartin
R8 with magnetic ride and r-tronic.. Worst decision.,AstonMartin
"Psst. You posted a picture of the V600 coupe but said roadster. They made 7 of each, and I prefer the coupe.",AstonMartin
Does it actually really cost $5k a year!??? That is a lot. What could possibly break every year,AstonMartin
"Interior space, try a similar year of V8 Vantage; with the lack of rear seats, you might notice slighly more space, although YMMV whether you're longer in the legs or in the torso. Also it depends which seats are equipped on your vehicle -- the original 'comfort' seats or the updated 'sport' seats that later became the sole seat option. If you have the updated seats, you should have more adjustability. You may need to play a fair bit with the seat/steering wheel position to get truly comfy though, and sometimes the adjustments are counter intuitive. e.g. move the seat forward a bit but change the angle of tilt instead.  
  
Regarding it feeling underbraked: DB9 is a heavy GT car (and tuned to be one) and uses the same 355mm front discs and four-piston calipers as the lighter V8 Vantage. You could probably change out your brake pads for a more aggressive compound if you want a more aggressive bite.  
  
The later DB9.2 or Vanquish gen. 2 might also yield an improvement though I can't say for certain; the platform is still the same.",AstonMartin
I think so?,AstonMartin
"They could improve the exterior, improve performance and handling, add more interior options, etc. There‚Äôs a lot they could do to make it damn near perfect as these new generation DBX, DB, DBS, and Vantage need to be to keep the company alive.",AstonMartin
"Im actually digging the lime accents and the wheels are sick. I would just add some lime accents to the rear like the diffuser. as much as i love a classy Aston, you dont see many of them that are on the sporty side so i like this.",AstonMartin
Ok yeah that sounds accurate. Now I just need to get my hands on a manual DBS from the era.,AstonMartin
Jesus Christ. That thing is sex.,AstonMartin
"Not to discount the fact it could be any number of things, bent wheel from manufacturing, defective half shaft, wheel bearing, ball joint, control arm bushings, etc. I have seen the EARC cause some very peculiar characteristics when not operating as intended. The system operates very differently than any other vehicle in the market, closest you get would be a bentayga, in the fact it actively counters metric tons of body movement via electronic ‚Äòfly by wire‚Äô type inputs. We have solved numerous suspension/ drivability issues similar to as you describe with software updates, 12v battery replacements, and in more interesting cases 48v battery as well as dc/dc converter module. 
Again not saying your concern is related to this system but as some issues are very hard to describe over text and given the complex systems fitted to the vehicle, it could be overlooked or missed as a possible cause.",AstonMartin
"I have to disagree with you. The automatic transmission they chose for the car is great for performance, but it could have issues or jerky shifts in city driving.",AstonMartin
"I saw someone did that but my problem with that is that it‚Äôs not actually an Aston.

I was seriously considering petitioning for the substantially similar waiver, whereby you can get it approved based on the fact it‚Äôs substantially similar to an approved imported car but it also seems like a mountain to climb.",AstonMartin
"Perfect.
Really appreciate it.
Next call, carrier. 
Glad to hear your living the dream daily.",AstonMartin
Ooh yay. That means current Gen are about to get cheaper and the boy racers dump for the new shiny.,AstonMartin
Modern era good thing is 3D printing is available and of course interior panels could me molded from carbon fiber. I am impressed it runs considering  how bad the interior looks.,AstonMartin
"I don‚Äôt have experience with that brand, but it looks pretty cool and if you‚Äôre tracking it anyway I say go for it.  It‚Äôs your car.",AstonMartin
"Gotcha, thanks!",AstonMartin

Man I wish Aston would still make those rims they look extra clean on the DBS,AstonMartin

"I‚Äôll keep you posted! I agree, it would be sweet. I‚Äôm going to get under it in the next few days and take some measurements for space requirements, then get some stuff ordered. 

You should see the carbon fiber wing I made and just installed on it",AstonMartin
I would guess Plasma Blue & Xenon Grey,AstonMartin
New Vantage is coming.,AstonMartin
It's pretty great. That said if you're even a little worried about maintaining it you can get about 85% of it in an XK-R which is way cheaper to keep on the road.,AstonMartin
My eyes have experience with Mansory body kits and based on that I can say with authority that they‚Äôre ugly as hell.,AstonMartin
They‚Äôre sturdy cars.  I‚Äôve really seen no major mechanical issues yet.  Small things that need repairs are expensive but that‚Äôs the luxury/exotic market.,AstonMartin
Love the interior,AstonMartin
No way that's a drawing...bruh. You are on a whole other level than my car drawings! Just WOW!,AstonMartin
"Definitely nice to chat with someone that works on them all the time, cause I don‚Äôt meet many people that work on these often. 

I know the engine pretty much sits in the firewall, but then the existing torque tube comes right off of it and looks to be as massive as the trans would be. So if you ditch the torque tube, why couldn‚Äôt the new trans sit right there? 

The only issue I feel like I‚Äôve seen would be getting the front driveshaft from the trans to the front axel, but as of now between the front wheels seems to be a ton of space. Might need to shift the cooling systems a bit, but there seems to be plenty of space in front of the motor for a front differential and axels. 

Definitely next time your under one think about and imagine it, and then light me up if it confirms my stupidity haha",AstonMartin

right so the grille is too big because the engine has too much power that is completely unnecessary in an Aston Martin i have a solution dont put 700 bhp in an Aston Martin.,AstonMartin
"15ft wide per space? Must be nice. I don‚Äôt have more than 6.5 ft for my db9. No I can‚Äôt open either door all the way, but I can get out fine. Just have to be real precise when pulling in. Also can only back out of my driveway one way because of an odd slope or it scrapes",AstonMartin

"The first thing I ever saw written about an Aston Martin, back in the 80s said it had the power of a Ferrari and luxury of a Rolls. Assuming that's still the proximate goal, horsepower has to be up there. However, I too dislike huge grilles as a rule and think the intakes could be handled elsewhere like below the grille, blacked out.",AstonMartin
It always makes me smile when I hear a 4.3 V8 described as underpowered üòâ,AstonMartin
I‚Äôll agree with that.,AstonMartin
You spelled ‚Äúruined‚Äù wrong,AstonMartin
"Also, worst comes to worst, just like my Nissan GTRs setup, couldn‚Äôt I just leave the existing torque tube setup and mount a new AWD gearbox where the existing gearbox is, and find a pathway forward to run a front driveshaft and front diff?

 I don‚Äôt necessarily need to mount the gearbox in the front, but I‚Äôve heard that the torque tube is prone to issues and breaking, especially with enough power. 

Just another idea.",AstonMartin
"I'm about two hours from the closest AM dealer in Nashville, I had to go once for a front windshield replacement.

Perfect‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs absolutely perfect. ü•∫,AstonMartin
Very achievable dream!,AstonMartin
"Aston usually does it only when they need to. I know on the DBX 707 they had to due to horsepower increase and cooling needs. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs the same on the DB12, it‚Äôs not far behind on horsepower and AM is cranking a lot more power out of these AMG engines than Mercedes ever did.",AstonMartin
"The facelift makes it look so much better.  The enlarged headlights actually fit the car now, where the old ones made it look like a Miata with a giant mouth.",AstonMartin

"Literally the opposite. DB9 have a few known issues but on the whole bulletproof, especially the engines

I can't stress enough how beautiful that isüòç,AstonMartin
"It‚Äôs a great vehicle at the price point in my opinion. Please get an extended warranty in the purchase it will pay for itself. Be prepared for the vehicle to depreciate but if you are looking for a vehicle to just have fun with and you don‚Äôt mind that factor it will put a smile on your face every time you are behind the wheel guaranteed. Maintenance is expensive and should be factored in but if it has extended warranty/ cpo most items will be covered other than usual wear and tear like brakes tires and oil changes. Beautiful spec in my opinion, if you can find a 707 in the same spec I‚Äôd highly recommend it but both are equally enjoyable.",AstonMartin

So it was sold on 12/09/2021 in Washington and ended up here in nj being titled on 5/28/2022 to the current ‚Äúowner‚Äù who also owns the dealership. Then on 10/26/23 it was listed for sale with 3730 miles. No services performed, or at least reported, besides the one in AZ. 
Does that seem like an odd carfax?",AstonMartin
I mean the timing chain on the 4.2 is a pretty legendary piece of repair work.,AstonMartin
"So much better than previous gen design. interior is very beautiful. Have to see it in person, I'm sure it is more beautiful. I think they should stop painting Astons in grey :)",AstonMartin
"Big grill makes the front end look mean and masculine. You can't have too much horsepower, just too much foot in the pedal.",AstonMartin
I like them both but I think the V8 DB11 have greater reliability so they'd probably be good for more regular use. Though it's a huge flex to have a v12 nowadays,AstonMartin
Breathtaking. An Aston Vanquish is what I asked Santa for.,AstonMartin
"Issues to look for:
Leaking engine oil pan, timing cover and cam covers.
Noisy PAS pump, noisy diff (oil change),
Leaking A/C condenser,
Loose suspension control Arm bushings,
Water entry on ALL lamps,
On later cars, leaking transmission oil cooler,
Door locks that don't lock.",AstonMartin
"The car itself may be cheap, the issue is the parts and maintenance. 

If you are far from a dealer maintenance may be an issue, and just because the car has depreciated hard doesn't mean parts have. So sure you can buy the car cheap but parts will cost like its a 200K car still. 

Basically, between those two things people are (and in many cases rightly so) scared to own them.",AstonMartin
"Can‚Äôt say iI‚Äôve had the experience of changing coil packs on these cars, but it‚Äôs a relatively easy plug‚Äôn play item that you can replace on most platforms nowadays, with the exception of reasonable clearance.

thats just a marketing scheme lmao it doesnt mean anything i could release a tiny Hyundai I10 rip off and call it ‚ÄúTHE WORLDS FIRST SUPER HATCHBACK‚Äù doesnt mean anything and unless you are Lewis Hamilton at Spa-Francorchamps you are NEVER going to be able to use all 700bhp even if you ARE Lewis at Spa you probably still cant use it all so theres 0 point especially when it makes the car look THAT ugly,AstonMartin
"Depending on the use case, both cars have great racing performance and pedigree! 

The DB11 was intended to be a Grand Touring car with a 2+2 seating arrangement (albeit the rear two seats can only fit a child!) with a decent size boot.

Vantage is lighter and if you compare the v8 models, the vantage is better on a track.

I own a 2018 DB11 with the 5.2L V12 and travelled around Europe with another fellow AM owner, which happens to be a 2019 4.0L V8 Vantage, and both of us agree that the DB11 is nicer to drive long distances and ever so slightly more practical.

In the UK (where I‚Äôm from) you can pick up a DB11 V12 for around ¬£80-90k on the second hand market which in my opinion is a steal, for an opportunity to own a beautiful art piece‚Ä¶ Or as David Brown once said, an ‚Äúobject of desire‚Äù‚Ä¶",AstonMartin

but its not a supercar this is not a Lamborghini competitor its a Bentley competitor and even the Ferrari it is competing doesnt even have 700bhp and thats an actual supercar brand that make thoroughbred supercars this is a problem with the car industry as a whole not just Aston Martin such as BMW giving their new M3 over 550bhp which is so overkill its ridiculous like the DB9 was never trying to put the max amount of BHP they could in the car they just put in a lot so you knew you were driving a premium and powerful car but not so much it was undriveable,AstonMartin
"It could also be renamed back to Vanquish, which is a rumour",AstonMartin

"I‚Äôve wanted a 911 since I was in 6th grade so I finally pulled the trigger. The back seats helped with my daughter as well. 

I love my 911 and it‚Äôs just an overall better car and dealer experience, but the Vantage was better in a few categories. Ownership of the vantage was more ‚Äúspecial‚Äù and the sound was incredible (although mine was modified). They‚Äôre pretty rare where I live, so people broke their necks looking on the road. Then people would crowd around and talk my ear off at car shows. I really have nothing bad to say about the car itself and am still a member of various owner forums to help out with questions since I know the car pretty well in and out.

I went older school with DB9. I actually was going after a vantage as well.  Dealers played around a bit with the vantage pricing. Turned me off and then began thinking of the db9.

"Well. You lucked out. I can actually answer intelligently.  At one point - I had the cayenne turbo, panamera turbo s, and the GT3.  I swapped out the GT3 last year but still have the other two and a few more. 

I would say this. My Jeep rubicon - has been more problematic than the Porsches.  No joke.  I‚Äôve had that in the shop at least 6 months out of my 10 year ownership.  I bought new but it had issues. GT3 never gave me an issue and I had the 991.1.  Engine was strong - no issues for me. Cayenne has given me electronic gremlins like rear wiper motor not working , drivers side window switch stuck, and not locking properly all of the time.  Panamera gave me SMG pump failure and air suspension issues.  However - I put fidelity warranties on them when they hit 50k. 

But other than those - normal maintenance. That might seem high to you for failures - but all air suspension will go At some point. The SMG pump was the random one but known on the older panameras. Cayenne - known more for electrical gremlins. 

For five years of ownership on the Porsches - I‚Äôll take those items.  You are going to replace tires and wear items. I would do an alignment every year.  It reduces wear on suspension.  

My BMW‚Äôs - were not cheaper. I‚Äôd say about the same as a porsche. Surprisingly. It‚Äôs not a Toyota - but, it‚Äôs not a Jeep either. lol.",AstonMartin

"After converting I think that would be a little higher here. Not a crazy amount but higher. Also keep in mind, while I also love low mileage cars, these need to be driven. 

If they sit for long periods of time that affects seals, fluids, etc. I don‚Äôt drive mine a lot but I make sure to put some miles on every week or two if I haven‚Äôt. If they started it up and let it idle that would also be nice. If it sat for months at a time then there can be some issues.",AstonMartin

"I don't know if they still have it, but they used to have a race called the Wine Country Classic. I got to go a couple of years in a row and saw an Ulster and a DB4 GT there as well as a bunch of other rare and cool cars like a Talbot Lago, a McLaren F1, and a Ferrari Enzo. Also got to sit in a then-current offering DB9. 

The only other time I got to sit in an Aston was when I received as a gift track time in a (approx 2009) Vantage V8 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. 

I've been an Aston Martin fan since the late 80s when I read about the latest offering describing it as having the luxury of a Rolls Royce and the performance of a Ferrari. That was during the Oscar India era of the V8.",AstonMartin

Generally speaking, small changes between production versions and a more limited version IMO see quite small differences. But this car is a completely different animal compared to the 'regular' V8 Vantage that is going to be updated soon. The V12 gives it so much character and raw punching power, its a full blown supercar. 

This color looks like Buckinghamshire green I believe - gorgeous in the light. Great shot friend!",AstonMartin
You know vantage prices didn't explode to the same extent as 997 and 996 prices. Is the play buying a vantage and hoping the prices blow up? Haha,AstonMartin

"I had mine for four years, you can see it in my submission history (the yellow one).  Mine was a 2009 4.7L coupe with a manual.  Bought it at 39k miles and it had 52k on it when it was wrecked (not my fault).  It was the best car I've ever owned up to this point, which is saying a lot because I've had an e39 M5.  As your friend said, they are very reliable for sports cars. 

Common issues: the weakest link is the clutch. I bought mine knowing I'd need to replace the clutch almost right away, and when I did I bought a twin-disc unit with lightweight flywheel from Velocity AP, which improved the engine response and clutch life dramatically. While it was out I also had the rear main seal replaced, that's just good preventative maintenance.  Parts and labor all together cost about $6500.  Worth every penny.

Pro tip: *never* reverse up an incline with the stock clutch.  You'll burn it out.  Reverse is geared super high for some reason.

The thermostat needed to be replaced, but that was a simple job I did myself in 2 hours with an $80 Jaguar part.  Make sure you're using the correct coolant if you do that.

Oil changes are dead simple.  Three drain plugs and an easily-accessible filter.  The filter and drain plugs are available from Redpants for about $45.  I recommend Motul 8100 X-power 10W60 synthetic oil.

The 2006-2008 models had a 4.3L V8 that was a bit underpowered and had a tendency to leak oil from the timing chain cover, so watch out for that, it's an engine-out job to fix.  The 4.7L engines in the '09 and newer models mostly fixed that issue.  I recommend the newer ones anyway, because you get a lot of upgrades to the suspension, drivetrain, and interior that make it a better experience overall.  However, if your budget is lower, the first gen cars are still a lot of car for the money. 

Prices are still good for these cars, but be aware that the manual trans cars are going to be more expensive than the Sportshift cars.  Real manuals are becoming more scarce.

Parts sourcing can be a pain if you need something Aston-specific, like body panels.  I'd recommend that you familiarize yourself with astonmartinbits dot com.  It's a company in Britain that sells new and used Aston parts.  I bought a full set of new brake rotors from them that ended up costing me half what I would've paid at scuderiacarparts, even with the international shipping. 

You can get a lot of excellent information from the forum members at 6speedonline.  

Overall I highly recommend a Vantage to anyone who wants a sports car that's not just another Corvette or Mustang.  Plus... well, just look at it.  It's gorgeous from every angle.

Good luck in your search!

Edit: I just noticed you said you're in western PA.  That's good news: it'll be a bit of a drive, but you can take your car to Steel Wings to have any work done.  They did my clutch replacement.  They are the best independent Aston shop on the east coast.",AstonMartin

Exactly my feeling! I love the DB12 - recently got to test drive it and I wanted to wait to see/drive the Vantage b/c the dealer said it'll be released soon. This new generation/face-lift Vantage is pretty much a baby DB12. The previous Vantage and DB11 had some differences and a wider gap in the two models uniqueness but these two facelifted models are very similar but I (like yourself) love the compactness of the Vantage. Interior is updated to reflect the luxury/price-tag just like the DB12 so no issues there either.,AstonMartin

"Yes, honestly it‚Äôs definitely a interesting model",AstonMartin
"Coming from someone in the same boat as you, don‚Äôt do it yet, or go the very modest route (used early VH vantage under $50k). If you have over 100k in the bank and are choosing to only put down a small down payment, that‚Äôs a different story. If you do not have enough money to afford the car yet, but you have a down payment and think you can get the monthly payment low enough to be affordable, I caution you against it. 

When you drive your Aston you are going to want to pamper it, give it the best life possible. Not cheap out and scrape by. Personally, this is my dream car and I‚Äôm waiting until I can do it comfortably and give it all the attention it deserves. In my frequent temptation, however, I think about going for an older VH vantage probably around 30k miles, manual, and having enough cash for an emergency fund, to continue growing my (small but non-zero) investments and comfortably afford any repairs, tires, leather work, etc to make it a top of the line ‚Äúcheap‚Äù Aston, rather than bottom of barrel newer one.",AstonMartin
"Same, except not car related.",AstonMartin
 Awesome,AstonMartin
It‚Äôs one of my favorite cars of all time,AstonMartin
"Looks unreal 

How‚Äôs the reliability on this beast?",AstonMartin

Is that California Sage? Don't think I've seen a DBS in that color,AstonMartin

You should check out the YouTube channel dadcars. He had a db9 and tests putting kids in the back seats of various sports cars,AstonMartin
"I bought a 2019 DB11 V8 about a year ago. Have put 10k miles on it. Had to get new coils literally before I got it home, but they were covered by warranty. Insurance runs me $3k per year and maintenance is $2k. No issues, other than the coils, yet. Happy to answer any specific questions you have.",AstonMartin
"As a fan of the older SL, I love the slow linear boat like ride of the S63 and Bentleys. Comfort cruiser over straight line acceleration",AstonMartin
"At least this isn't full of ""What model?"" and trashy modifications",AstonMartin
I don't. The materials and finish is beautiful but the shapes and layout looks weird.,AstonMartin
"I kind of get the cynicism because of how long the VH cars stuck around for but realistically what other boutique manufacturer has cars with life cycles of 5-6 years? Most economy cars from global conglomerates are on sale longer than that, and those companies don't have the financial grim reaper lurking around the corner",AstonMartin
"Personal taste of course but I never really liked the buttressed ""floating roof"" of the DB11/DBS/DB12 (I don't outright despise it, but just prefer something simpler like the VH models) and feel the volantes are a bit more resolved. They're also more like a 3-box design which reminds me of the old muscle car esque Astons. 

They also don't gain that much weight versus the hardtops - probably down to the fact the hardtops are pillarless and in general I've heard they're very un-compromised compared to most drop top variants of cars.",AstonMartin
Wasted money,AstonMartin
DB11 is the way to go imo but honestly it‚Äôs personal preference.,AstonMartin
"Bigger grill is not necessarily more efficient and don't necessarily makes more turbulence inside the hood, One77 doesn't have a grill this big and have more horsepower.

I think this is way more because of the looks just like was DB7 Zagato for example.",AstonMartin
How do they work?,AstonMartin
Skippy might not appreciate it either.,AstonMartin
If you can't sell it I'd pick the v600,AstonMartin
"You can easily have the older models tuned up to 610-620. I did, and it made a world of difference for the power. Not the same as the 2025 obviously, but it may scratch the itch you have.",AstonMartin

This. I have a V8VS and it‚Äôs been bullet proof. Service is expensive but then again this was originally a hand built $145k car (I paid less than half that) so it goes with the territory.,AstonMartin

"i mean but it really is a supercar though it had as much brake horsepower as the flagship Ferrari at the time and was marketed as a much tighter, faster and harder Aston Martin",AstonMartin
According to Aston Martin life they have some serious issues they need to work with.,AstonMartin
"> right but even Clarkson would agree 700bhp is way too much lmao

What in the world are you talking about?",AstonMartin
"I‚Äôve owned a 2011 Vantage for about 4 years. It‚Äôs been very reliable, easy to maintain, and not too bad on service costs. Only had one unexpected failure so far, which was the parking brake. I‚Äôm sure there will be plenty more things in the future, but for the last few years, it‚Äôs been great. 

I think they‚Äôre fantastic cars for the money, even if it‚Äôs not the fastest around.",AstonMartin
Gorgeous color. Which red?,AstonMartin
It was standard on the previous generation of vantage for at least the front part of the hood / bonnet and quarter panels. You could request more like whole car.,AstonMartin
Reminds me of some of the wild-color Hot Wheels I had in the late 60s.,AstonMartin
No.,AstonMartin
tbh if i was in the market to buy an Aston Martin DB12 i‚Äôd just probably buy a 2012 DBS a car thats much better looking and isnt concerned and isnt completely overblown with too much power,AstonMartin
I agree. It‚Äôs beautiful!,AstonMartin
Keep the stock wheels. Changing the wheels on any Aston is asking for problems from my experience,AstonMartin
Thanks for sharing!,AstonMartin
"It‚Äôs still crazy. There‚Äôs only 7 because of trim changes, like when they say they‚Äôre a 1 of 1 Bugatti or a 1 of 1 Pagani, where they‚Äôre literally changing the trim aspects like wheel colors and interior leather stitching. 

Yes the v600 was its own package but that will not sell for 1.3m. It‚Äôs a 400k car with a slightly unusual trim package that they sold for 1.2m. There were over 300 of v12‚Äôs made. 

To put it in perspective, the one-77 is a true super car and there were only 77 of them made. They go for around 1.6-1.8. No way v12 roadster is getting close to that money. One was listed this summer (no 1 of 7 so the first) for 500-700k.",AstonMartin
Whoa are these really going for that low or is this a scam?,AstonMartin
"I love it, those rims are something! No problem with the stripes for me although it would look more classy without them for sure (but maybe the rims wouldn't match with their ""racing"" aesthetics then)",AstonMartin
"A couple friends with 2005-2007 DB9s who have experienced main bearing wear (engine failure). The common belief online is that only 05-06 Cosworth motors are affected, but it seems to happen frequently up to 07 for whatever reason. Use caution, listen for ticking/knocking on cold start. That said, I know two early cars with upwards of 170k miles on them, so it really comes down to luck and maintenance.",AstonMartin
What engine is in it?,AstonMartin
"Power, Beauty, Soul on 2010 Vantage. It's cheesy, but still love it.",AstonMartin
"Otherwise it‚Äôs a too steep jump from Toyota to Aston, you need a middle step haha",AstonMartin
"Thank you all for your replies! I‚Äôm still super torn, but I think I‚Äôm going to go with the DB11. The V12 sound is just simply unbeatable, and one of you mentioned the track - you‚Äôre right, I couldn‚Äôt push it to the limits anyway lol",AstonMartin
Excuse my lack of confirmed knowledge - is this a Lesheng EV?!,AstonMartin
The 1/500 denotes a first edition.  They are not individually numbered though.,AstonMartin
"Would also throw Lexus LC500 in there, slower of course but better interior arguably than all of these listed besides the Bentley and by far the most reliable.",AstonMartin
like the DB7 prices? because those should have sprung up but are still mired in the lows.,AstonMartin
"I‚Äôm thinking the current gen‚Äôs are sort of the 996 generation of Aston‚Äôs to be fair. They‚Äôll drop, but the VH platforms will maintain value and I am eager to see what the newest gen‚Äôs bring. DB12 is a strong launch point.",AstonMartin
"Aston Martin is pretty bullet proof. And even then the maintenance cost is far lower than other exotics just from the fact that most Merc shop can service AM as well, and spare parts are usually not that rare.",AstonMartin
That‚Äôs good to know. I was actually thinking of going into rapide s from the panamera. They have plenty of room in the panamera.,AstonMartin
Can always ask in here. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had mine long enough to talk about ownership cost. I did need my coils replaced shortly after buying. But that‚Äôs really it.,AstonMartin
Yeah I‚Äôm a huge fan of this.,AstonMartin
YES. üôå. Do it.,AstonMartin
Belongs to a good friend of mine. My other cars are all ICE.,AstonMartin
yeah makes a lotta sense,AstonMartin
"I think they need to spin up some new names.
The second generation Vanquish took me a while to warm to, but it now has my heart.
I think I would cry if they besmirched the name with a poor design choice.",AstonMartin
"Cheap that. As someone in the UK who looks at Astons a lot, you‚Äôre looking at the equivalent of 80k EUR for the same age/mileage",AstonMartin
True. I love the fact they‚Äôre NA. I hate turbos with a passion and you can really squeeze a lot out of them.,AstonMartin
It‚Äôs a great way to spend money while devaluing the car at the same time.  Kill two birds with one stone.,AstonMartin
Porsche DBX,AstonMartin
"Very nice! I can say I‚Äôm very jealous of the gorgeous driving roads in the NY area. Florida doesn‚Äôt have much other than straight lines for miles, ha!",AstonMartin
"Definitely the V12 just because it has a V12. But the V8 is a better car in almost every way, so I think your‚Äôe sacrificing dynamics and performance for better resale values‚Ä¶You can already get a very good deal on a V8 DB11 though and values are unlikely to fall past a certain point.",AstonMartin
"They are. I looked up Ferrari Mondials recently and they are around AU$100,000 (¬£55,000)",AstonMartin
"i don't have one and the car is at the garage atm. but it's just a db9 (standard grey) with some red accents, mainly in the interior.",AstonMartin
Very cool üòé,AstonMartin
This.  Thermostat stuck open,AstonMartin
"Like everyone else, One 77.",AstonMartin
"It‚Äôs really a terrific time to buy some of these high depreciated, reliable (from an exotic perspective) beauties   I imagine prices go north fairly soon",AstonMartin
One 77.   Having seen 3 in the flesh it‚Äôs absolutely spectacular in any colour.  Huge wide presence from every angle.,AstonMartin
"I definitely get that, you should be fine with the A/S. Michelins overall are excellent, I wouldn't be concerned much at all!",AstonMartin
"This is really pertinent and relatable. Might be unpopular comparison too because I considered a Vantage last year and then eventually got an Evora GT because it drives so much more different than my Audi S3. The Vantage didn‚Äôt feel as different.

But you still see me on this sub because I‚Äôll get an Aston one day. I‚Äôve always wanted one and I‚Äôll get one. I‚Äôve always wanted a Lotus too and that one just happens to join the collection sooner.",AstonMartin
It‚Äôs beautiful. And probably costs around $600-700k here in Denmark.,AstonMartin
I want a manual trans for my DB9,AstonMartin
Rear seat room in DB11 is very good much better than 911. I have had 2 adults in mine and its acceptable yes its only a plus 2 but for kids more than enough.,AstonMartin
The answer is and always will be ‚Äúyes‚Äù!,AstonMartin
"this was listed as from belgium

i agree now,  it looks like a scam

never the less i wasnt going to buy this specific model,  im looking for a 4,7 v8 vantage and will only buy from a good dealer not private",AstonMartin
"It is definitely a part of Aston Martin history. I've driven one. It's basically a massively overpriced Toyota IQ with a nice interior. I would not own one. 

The V8 version is hilarious however.",AstonMartin
That Aston looks a bit too cheap!,AstonMartin
"Yes. Running them on my Subaru STI. Great rubber.  Tracked the Sport 4S version in summer and used to switch to Blizzaks, but now just run the all seasons.",AstonMartin
I just saw this on marketplace the other day and was like wow what a price until I saw that interior. That‚Äôs gonna be a costly repair,AstonMartin
"What a soundtrack you gonna have in your back. Just go for it. Amazing car, amazing design and entertainment forever.",AstonMartin

"Yeah same. I skipped the entire previous generation, I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to like it. I‚Äôll probably pay a visit to the dealership in the next few weeks now.",AstonMartin
"That one is beautiful, too! The yellow reflection in the first pic is a DBX 707 to the right. Surrounded by so much goodness!",AstonMartin
"The only car I can think of he's ever mentioned as having too much power was the Ferrari F12 but he didn't say it exactly as such.  Plus, if you've ever experienced that car, it was a handful which was corrected by the updates and rear wheel steer in the 812 \[which made even more power but is way more controllable\].",AstonMartin
No,AstonMartin
"The DBX actually has an incredibly-small turning radius.  Couldn't tell you about the competition, but can't complain, and I can tell you I think it looks way better than all the competition.",AstonMartin
"Appreciate  your feedback. As I replied to someone else, I just got rid of my GLS63 so very familiar with the AMG platform. Not sure if I want to go back into an SUV style but it‚Äôs an option",AstonMartin
I think a stock price comparison can answer some of that.,AstonMartin
"True but that V12 allowed a larger surface area for heat dissipation, and as a result made the smaller grille work. In DB12's case, it has a twin-turbo V8 with approx 170bhp/L specific power output and a much smaller surface area for heat dissipation. Hence the need for a bigger grille with bigger radiators.",AstonMartin
"Not sure what your angle is here. Are you considering buying? Most of what you have called out is rather subjective. You didn't give the year but I'm guessing '05-'09. If so, that's reasonably low miles for a 15+yo car. Leather shrinkage does happen if parked outside much and not sure what the fix would be. 

What's more concerning would be possible blue smoke and engine condition. It should be checked out by a good tech. That's where the big $$'s would be for repair.

All that said, I have an '05 that looks a lot like that and no one has ever called it a POS. If it doesn't have any major defects I would guess it would be worth $40-$50 K-US. There are websites that will give you a valuation.

Good luck",AstonMartin
"The Range Rover is probably a softer ride but nowhere near as fun, fast or dynamic driving as the 707... and thats facts",AstonMartin
Car Design,AstonMartin
"The fighter cockpit was an inspiration for the gen1 NSX design. I think Aston may have paid some lip service to this concept, but go sit in an NSX and it‚Äôs a fairly clear difference.

I raise myself in the seat as well, which tends to bring the roofline lower in my field of view and certainly does not feel like a fighter jet cockpit.",AstonMartin
Aston martin wings and smoked rear lamps for $750 each is buffoonery.,AstonMartin
Why did you sell? Been thinking about an AMG GT or a Vantage myself.,AstonMartin
"Aston makes the most ‚Äòlook back‚Äô cars of any brand 

(Cars that the owner enjoys looking back at every time they park, even years after the purchase.)


I like the dark color you chose, but I know firsthand how difficult it can be to keep clean.",AstonMartin
You can buy that so you can tell everyone that you drive an Aston Martin. Just sayin‚Äô .,AstonMartin
HOW?! It looks like it‚Äôs just been polished. Very nice,AstonMartin
"On the website it says 1 of 7. I personally like it a lot, maybe because I also saw it in real life but yeah, taste is different.",AstonMartin
Wild. I saw it worked for all their V12s but didn't know if every platform would give the same results. Do the 08-12 DBS and 15 Vantage have the same V12?,AstonMartin
I want a cygnet so badly but it‚Äôs impossible where I am as they were never legally imported.,AstonMartin
"Eh different strokes, I usually hate massive grilles but this works quite well with the shape of the car. The AM SUV thingy is awful though",AstonMartin
"I‚Äôd take a look at one in person. The db11 rear seats are not a bad size (for car seats maybe) but there‚Äôs very little leg room. If you‚Äôre even slightly tall it will leave very little room for the kid‚Äôs legs. 

They may fit, but don‚Äôt go out to eat or they won‚Äôt make it back home.",AstonMartin
The dealer checked the chassis but I don‚Äôt know what exactly they looked into I will bring it up to there attention,AstonMartin
"Also, the DBX is not the same platform as the Vantage.",AstonMartin
"Honestly, I never truly considered any of those other options. I just settled for them until I was able to afford my Aston.",AstonMartin
"Richard is great, but tbh, they‚Äôre not cars that you have to tinker a whole lot with. You can get in to upgrades (like cat deletes, twin plate clutch, etc) but it‚Äôs not like other cars where you A) need to tinker with things and B) have to fix a whole lot.",AstonMartin
Thanks so much!,AstonMartin
How much is the quote?,AstonMartin
"completely disagree with this, the S63 Coupe is one of the best automotive secrets on the market right now -- if you want to cross continents quickly and in comfort, I'd struggle to think of a better car short of a Wraith.  As a sports car the S63 fall short but if OP's goal is to take big trips (ya know, a grand tour) I'd struggle to think of a better car.

That said, I'd probably have the latest Continental GT \[2018+\], then the S63, then the DB11.",AstonMartin
its very odd considering they dont have to ship the cars. Who is your local aston dealer?,AstonMartin
"Not the model Lagonda, the make. The Lagonda Rapide is a DB4/5 looking four-door.",AstonMartin
"Work of art. Aston always had the exterior, but now that they've nailed the interior these cars are gonna sell like crazy",AstonMartin
That's definitely understandable. The Vantage starts at $146K USD and the DB11 is $220K USD. With trim and specs the prices get pushed up.,AstonMartin
What about cost of drop in value (depreciation) when racking up miles with daily driving?,AstonMartin
"I mean it is a part of AM history, considering they needed this to go racing. But outside of that, it‚Äôs basically the Scrappy Doo of Astons: you know he‚Äôs not the real deal, but (some) still love him",AstonMartin
"Panamera are grand tourers and 911s are sports cars

Panamera :: 911
DB12 :: Vantage",AstonMartin
"A couple of things but we can play that game with most cars. 

For instance the rotors on my V8VS are like $2k per corner but they are 1/4 that price for a V8V. 

However the brembo brake pads on a vantage are like $180 to $250 which is comparable to any sports car and not more expansive.",AstonMartin
"Pic 2 and 3 are from the current, unfacelifted car, although given what Stroll said about carry over at the rear end and how absolutely nothing changed in that area on the DB12, pic 2 will probably stay looking like that verbatim",AstonMartin
"What model, sportshift or 6MT?",AstonMartin
"Maybe it's just me but aston just isn't really a talked about car brand compared to the likes of Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini, and McLaren in public. Attracts a niche audience. I love em so that's all that matters to me.",AstonMartin

I know it‚Äôs unrelated but they actually converted a bunch of V12 Vanquish cars to AWD for the filming of Die Another day so Aston has done this before. And don‚Äôt forget, someone asked Aston to put the v8 4.7L engine in a Cygnet and they did it:

"Short answer‚Ä¶.yes. 

The DB11 also gets a lot of hate despite being a great car. The reason for this is it was the first ‚Äúmodern‚Äù Aston Martin under the Mercedes partnership and it followed the most beautiful cars in Aston‚Äôs history like the prior generation DBS and Vanquish. I get that in some specs the interior is also not as great as those cars but the DB11 was so customizable, and in my opinion the chopped carbon and wood grain trims are every bit top level Aston Martin (even if no one to this day understands why the plastic black trim was even allowed as a jewelry option). 

The thing everyone ignores - it drives so much better than those prior generation cars. It such a better car than the DB9 and manages to be both more exciting when driving it hard and more comfortable as a GT car when cruising. It also has loads more interior space - I am 6'6"" and I cant comfortably fit in the DB9 (yes I drove it anyway to see how it was) while the DB11 is cavernous in comparison. The biggest issue the DB11 has is that the V8 is better than the V12. Which is good for second hand buyers, but bad if you care about the depreciation on your V8. Terrible buy as a brand new car, like many other Astons.",AstonMartin
"I‚Äôm an Aston Martin lover - classics mainly.   I have to ask; does anyone else think the rear of these things look a bit ‚Äòlip implant‚Äô?   A bit ‚Äòtrout-pout‚Äô.  A bit Angelina Jolie ‚Ä¶.. if not, look again.   üíã",AstonMartin

"Lol, speak to people in the Porsche and Ferrari subs, they‚Äôll tell you Aston Martin is going to implode any second. There was even a guy in here a couple days ago trying to tell people to buy Cayennes instead of DBX because they are in the ropes lol.

Timeless certified is about $6k a year if you go with newer.  Inspection is around $500 - and that assumes you don‚Äôt need to fix anything.  You can buy two years for around $11k upfront.  Then you add in maintenance of around $2-4k depending on what is needed.

Maybe a higher mileage 2017. I was looking for a 2019/2020 with low miles and the cheapest I was seeing at that time was around 115-120 and those had shady histories. Sites like vroom had the cheapest ones but the car history seemed off. Many owners and issues.

"Yes precisely, I‚Äôm looking hard at the S63 coupe just because it‚Äôs less conspicuous and also the most affordable of the bunch (at least in my local market).

Do it,AstonMartin
"What I've always loved about Astons has been the fact that they're still usable as a 'normal' car, but happen to go like a bat out of hell and put a stupid grin on your face. The first part is where the One-77 -- for me -- fails to do it, and [this video from Harry's Garage should show why](https://youtu.be/cKhGO3a3cqg?t=224). No behind-the-seat shelf, and no storage in the 'hatchback'. I have an Aston because I'm a car guy; I am not rich, I don't have staff to carry my luggage for me.

So I'm going against the grain and saying V600 Coupe. The V12 Vantage Roadster is pretty sweet looking but then is useless if there's any bit of rain, and you need to wear a helmet since there's no windscreen. If the Victor was an option, however, I'd have picked that.",AstonMartin
Thanks everyone for your replies! This was extremely helpful. I found a [Rapide that is the same color (Silver Blonde)](https://youtu.be/mNrNm5DNzxU?si=oUXeHTIkWFWUY9vP) and it is genuinely gorgeous. Plan on buying a V8 DB11 and will certainly paint it this color. Cheers!,AstonMartin

"So I went from normal Rapide to Rapide S to Rapide AMR in a relatively short time frame. My advice (if you can stretch) is to try and get the S, better gear box, autonomy and drive than the original Rapide, the tech is also marginally better and much better after 2017 when you get Apple play as standard. Pluses: much more usable and flexible Aston than the rest, a great and tested platform, actually rarer than most other Astons, a beautiful line. Downsides: they seem to depreciate more than other Astons, there seems to be snob sub by Aston two door car owners in the main against the Rapide, it‚Äôs now quite an old platform being based on the DB9 platform but stretched, its previous generation Aston now. Overall however I would say go for it!!",AstonMartin
"I have owned a 2005 DB9 for 8 years and have put on 10,000 miles (35k total). We have an owners club with dozens of Astons in N. Calif. and the consensus is Astons are well engineered and durable. There's no dealer in town and I have done my own oil changes using OEM filter and full synthetic. The filter on left hand drive is a PIA to get to but doable. High performance tires are expensive as you'd expect. The only actual breakage I've had is an oil cooling line sprung a leak which was fixed by a local hydrolics shop for about $100. Though the special trans fluid is pretty pricey ($10/qt) and putting it in isn't easy. Insurance is a bit higher than a regular car as you'd expect, but not outrageous.

All that said, it's a joy to drive, the sound and acceleration are intoxicating. And it's so beautiful. For me, nothing else quite compares.",AstonMartin
"So, I learnt new info, Vantage name staying. I have the face, the rear and the new BHP figure. Launch on 12th. The something else is the GT3 car",AstonMartin

"Can‚Äôt speak for vantage but I definitely didn‚Äôt enjoy taking my db11 into the city, it‚Äôs just far too wide (both for driving the north circular and even the street parking spots in north London). I managed to curb my wheels trying to tuck it in a space before I realized it‚Äôs wider than the space. Didn‚Äôt even go near the congestion zone with it

With the vantage being the same width as the db11, I‚Äôd imagine the same applies, but YMMV",AstonMartin

"It‚Äôs not a ‚Äòtrim package‚Äô, it barely uses any body panels from a regular Vantage.

And it was originally built as a money-no-object custom order for a single very wealthy collector via Q. They just decided to build six more after that.

So basically this is the custom dream car of some billionaire Aston collector. It was never really meant to have commercial appeal.",AstonMartin
"Possibly. But I have never seen an Aston in Alaska. As far as I know, I may be the only one.",AstonMartin
I plan to put nearly 70k miles on it within a few years and likely track it.  Modding the grill to look closer to the db12 is probably the least devaluable thing it'll see,AstonMartin

I also really like the current Vantage.  Everything you need and nothing you don‚Äôt in a great looking sports car.,AstonMartin
"Why thanks! Glad to hear. I won it in an auction and it‚Äôs now very very far away from any AM dealership, so I‚Äôm glad to know it had a good upbringing",AstonMartin

I have heard about not reversing up a hill. What does that damage? I usually back into to my garage up a very slight uphill driveway. Just to be safe, I guess I‚Äôll pull in.

"It will still be big (bigger, even) but its face should be more like the DBR22- that and the spyshots give a very good idea of how it'll look. The headlights being a lot bigger should give it a much more proportional appearance too",AstonMartin
"I love that Aston, but the price is just ridiculous. At the end it‚Äôs based of a V12 Vantage, and many people also think of the V8 Vantage when they see the V12. And the V8 is 45k$+, which is cheap when you see that the V600 is 1.3. I think the value of a V600 should be 1 mil. The one 77 is 3 million but it‚Äôs truly unique. 77 units. But the V600 is based off of a V12 as I said and the V600 has 7 units. I think 1 mil is alright. But D√ñRR has to make money too.",AstonMartin
The rear was the best part. üòê,AstonMartin
This is the answer! Wait 6 months for the updated interior,AstonMartin
"The Volante market value is lower than the coupes (which are also designated as ‚ÄúBase‚Äù models.) I like the look of the coupe better, and I suspect the cost and trouble of keeping a 20 year old convertible top in watertight and working order drives the price down.

I was also shocked at the prices a few years ago when my brother, who is in the car industry, told me about them. I was looking for an older Porsche 911 and he pointed me toward Aston. I ended up with a 2009 DB9 instead. No regrets. Maintenance is expensive, but finding a good mechanic with experience and sourcing non-OEM parts makes it much more manageable. Once Ford acquired them and also Volvo, a lot of the parts became less proprietary, and therefore more readily available and less expensive.",AstonMartin
"The reverse gear is way too tall, so it's almost like trying to start off in 3rd.  That wears the clutch down quickly. 

The engagement point is pretty high in the pedal travel from factory, but if you don't feel it bite until it's almost fully released it's time to change it.  Let it go too long and it'll start to slip under hard acceleration.",AstonMartin
"As a sweeping generalization that has exceptions, V12‚Äôs depreciate less than v8‚Äôs.",AstonMartin

Easy to fix the rear differential whine?,AstonMartin
I daily drove one for three years.  Zero real problems.  All my issues were things like the door struts going bad.  The worst thing was a check engine light that was a busted vacuum line under the intake manifold. Was about $1000 to fix.  I spent more in total on oil changes.,AstonMartin
"My take is very similar to yours. I don't love the Vantage front end (altho I prefer the mesh vs veined grille) / headlights (they seem too simple and not as thoughtful) but the ducktail is gorgeous IMHO. But I *love* the tail light config and rear lower valance. 

I'm OK with the attention, it's just part of the deal w ownership, but I'm also not a big attention person. I drove my friends 2020 Vantage for a bit and the most it got was a lot of little kids with big smiles asking what it was. 

Somehow the DB11 feels the most special of the bunch.

I'm a long time AMG fanboy, but the outgoing GT, specifically the C, doesn't work for me as a daily. I went into this thinking I'd land on the F-Type, which is great but seems the least special of the lot #firstworldprobs for sure!",AstonMartin
"Agree it looks a lot like db12 from the front. Think it just kills db12 demand unless you want 4 seats.

I don't work for Aston, unfortunately, but if I did and found out that a dealership was fraudulently or negligently letting CPO vehicles out the door with structural issues, step one would be damage control with OP. The second would be gathering information to figure out who I needed to tear a new asshole in. It's a serious lawsuit waiting to happen. Or a death, followed by an *even worse* lawsuit.",AstonMartin

There is more room in the DB11. My daughters are now in their 20‚Äôs and 5‚Äô4‚Äù -5‚Äô8‚Äù. I traded my 911 C4S Cab 2018 for the DB11 volante   We can take a drive up to 20 minutes without too much trouble. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô.,AstonMartin
Yes it is! I also think I can change regions as well,AstonMartin
A fresh set of coil packs/plugs,AstonMartin
"Haha, fully share your view (except for the vane grill) <3 . Though I am quite curious how the new one will look. My hypothetic favorite would be the current version with the 707 engine. Asked them to make it, but they declined. Probably such a car would be ""too good"", beating the db12 at least.",AstonMartin
"On the V12s (DBS and DB11) at cold start the secondary air system is working for a few seconds to warm the catalysts, it's not misfire but the engine isn't as responsive, and sounds different it goes away after a few 10s of seconds, real misfire sets off the MIL",AstonMartin
"Have you ever had a discoloration from it? I worry as that has happened to other cars of mine in the past with various products, and my DB11 has a blue and tan interior. Thanks!",AstonMartin
I was there last week and they were cleaning the interior and I got a chance to see it inside. It looks like a spaceship,AstonMartin

"I‚Äôve thought about the weight distribution change and I don‚Äôt think it would be enough of a change to throw it off too bad, especially with adding the ability of the front wheels to help out when necessary. 

The weight of the heavy torque tube would be ditched, the trans weight shifted towards the motor which sits super far back, so the trans would be towards the center, then adding a diff in the rear. I think it would even out with maybe a smidge more weight towards the front. 

I‚Äôll definitely keep you informed when I start. It‚Äôs nice you have some aftermarket support over there. There is literally nothing here in States in regard to anything aftermarket for Astons.",AstonMartin
I‚Äôve been invited to drive the car at the start of February,AstonMartin
right but even Clarkson would agree 700bhp is way too much lmao i mean this car has a whole 250 bhp more than the DB9 and i dont think anyone would say the DB9 is particularly slow,AstonMartin
It had them but they had to be removed since we got rear ended a few months ago :/,AstonMartin
Genuine question. Whats the difference between this and the Victor?,AstonMartin

Thanks for the compliment and confirming you have the same lighting on your Aston Martin. Love the Vantage!,AstonMartin
i think it works better on the SUV because its a bigger car so a humongous grille isnt quite as obnoxious i just think the DB12 looks like it was designed by Americans take from that what you will,AstonMartin

The Vanquish is probably my favourite Aston of all time. Great Color choice!,AstonMartin
Pretty color,AstonMartin
Yeah me too because I have one,AstonMartin
"I recently researched and tesf drove 2020 vantage and db11 - ultimately went for a new Jaguar f-type p575. It was a tough choice and I ultimately went for the new car with 5 yr warranty and free maintenance. one lesson I learned is that you should only buy a CPO from an Aston dealer, it should come with an AM one year warranty which can be extended (but expensive). 
Ask for the service records - they should be available available",AstonMartin

eh we can really debate about semantics all you want between grand tourer and supercar all we want but its missing the point that the DBS  or Vanquish has always been a much harder faster version of DB (insert number) so it makes sense for a DBS to have 715 bhp even if its massively overkill and completely a gimmick,AstonMartin

I completely agree probably my favorite color I have ever seen on a car,AstonMartin
I love it,AstonMartin
"Hi,
Honestly, no I‚Äôve never had a problem..I was a bit concerned when I got the Vantage with paler coloured leather but I did a little test (as Auto Glym recommends) on a bit of the passenger seat at the base of the backrest to double check..it was fine so I carried on. probably worth doing a test first (whatever product you end up using‚Ä¶)

Do you have more pictures?  I might be interested.  Where abouts are you in terms of shipping?,AstonMartin
"Absolutely. Their kit works for all their V12s. So in fact, you can make a DB9 sound like this.",AstonMartin
"Keep the audio system - one of the best upgrades to be had that I got on my DB12V. Quality is quite outstanding and great with the top down or when in high speed highway driving.

I didn‚Äôt get carbon on center but got standard gloss black. I regret not getting a wood or carbon as the gloss gets dirty with anything.

Carbon fiber lower package also gets damaged pretty easily if your roads and driveways are uneven like mine or made of poorly maintained cobblestone.",AstonMartin
"That‚Äôs interesting to know, thanks",AstonMartin
"If it‚Äôs anything like some other cars (F-Type comes to mind), one possible downside is that, in photos, you have to deal with choosing between either the mirrors being folded in while the car is locked or the door handles sticking out when unlocked.

Personally, I love the manual lever handle. The act of positioning your hand to push the opposite end with your index finger already places it in exactly the right orientation to then open the door. I think it‚Äôs a bit of a weird shape to otherwise present outwards automatically. I‚Äôm surprised they don‚Äôt just include it as standard and make it a configurable setting though.",AstonMartin
"If Aston put the problem in Astons and it causes Astons to have problems, it is an Aston problem regardless of where it originated.",AstonMartin

"Also, regarding the rough idle. I had a rough idle when I had misfires. It was a stutter more than just shaking. 

Even now with new coils and plugs the idle can shake a little on cold start. There seems to be a point as it is warming up when the rpm‚Äôs drop and it can shake a little.

"It‚Äôs worth more than $10k to a breakers just for parts.

The dash leather can be fixed for about $1.5 to $2k, wood fascia‚Äôs can be replaced for another $2k for all of them but ‚Äúglitter‚Äù in the engine and knocking sounds like an engine out rebuild aka $15k to $20k. If you found an independent you could probably get it in good very shape for $25k and it‚Äôs probably worth $40k then.",AstonMartin
"If you disagree that's fine, so do I (as my vote would be my very own DB9) But I trust Chris Harris, who drove an M5 comp back to back with a DB12 and said he would take the M5 every time, despite how much better looking and sounding the DB12 is.

Suppose ""best"" is relative. Best looks, sounds, power, beauty, soul - Aston.

Best for actual grand touring and logging on the miles with a partner and loads of luggage - M5",AstonMartin
"Because, especially for the roadster, it‚Äôs a fairly typical thing to do when the weather is nice. It‚Äôs a hallmark of most two seaters, especially British ones. Now the body sides go up much higher and your side windows are much smaller in area. 

Please note I am comparing current model to previous, not to other brands.",AstonMartin
"I think it's weird to consider the S63 in the same buying conversation as a DB11. S63's while good cars feel mass produced and there's nothing special about them. I live in a very wealthy area in a very high COL city, and S63's are dime a dozen. DB11's are much rarer and feel like a true elite marque. Merc feels like just one grade up from your regular commuter cars like Toyotas, like an Audi or Lexus.

I think if you buy the S63, it will nag at you ""what if"" but I don't see you ever thinking ""I wish I'd given the S62 a chance"" when you're eating those roads in a DB11.",AstonMartin

"> Does it actually really cost $5k a year!???

For *maintenance?* Not even close. Regular maintenance is not that bad.  

BUT they said to '**set aside $5k**', not '*expect to spend $5k*'. My yearly maintenance has been under $1,000 CAD per year, including fluid changes, brake pads, etc. Repairs, on the other hand, that's a crapshoot; mine hasn't actually 'broken' since buying it in 2020 so I really haven't needed to do any repairs -- other than the coolant level sensor float becoming porous (caused a low coolant warning but the car drove just fine), so I spent $600 on a new coolant overflow tank from Scuderia Car Parts and replaced it myself. Would have been fine without it, just risky in case you do actually get a low coolant state.  
  
But I'm doing the twin-plate clutch and lightweight flywheel upgrade from Velocity AP; the parts alone are ~$6,000 CAD. If I was doing it out of necessity then it would be a repair (since a badly-worn clutch is an error state in need of repair), in which case having that money set aside would be a big help. The $5k per year is just your 'car fund', that's all. Car doesn't break, hooray, you've been saving $5k a year and now have $25,000 after five years of ownership. Neato, right?",AstonMartin
"OP - I am also a porsche lover.  Had a GT3 and moved into poor man‚Äôs McLaren. Currently have a panamera turbo s and the cayenne turbo.  I don‚Äôt think you will be as enthralled with DBX. Not this version. You would need to step up into newer years. 

I thought about DBX briefly - but I believe you will lose another $40k in 6-12 months. I think you can wait it out which I plan on or you might consider the turbo s hybrid cayenne. Those are hovering around $100-120k.  You‚Äôll have porsche extended AND - you can add to it even after factory if you keep it for awhile or rack up mileage. I‚Äôve had my cayenne and added another 5/60k platinum to it. I already added it once after my CPO expired. 

The giggle factor with acceleration is unmatched. I cross shopped the bentayga.  That‚Äôs just a boat. I owned the GLS for about 2 months. Just am not a MB person and losing only $10k. I thought worth it to dump and cut my losses. 

I have a DB9 AM volante.  I definitely wanted an AM and went with more of a classic since I wanted a v12 - and would use it when sunny.  If I were you - I‚Äôd stick to porsche for the daily duties and pick up a fun AM for sunny days.

 In my Aston Martin ownership experience, I will say that in all certainty, it WILL break.
Plan for a couple thousand a year for general servicing, but have a larger pile of cash stashed for the inevitable..

These simply
 are not nearly as robust or well engineered like my 911's have been. And far, far more fragile than our vintage Mercedes SL.

"Hi
I bought a 2014 N430 manual last year and have been running it almost daily since..it‚Äôs an absolute dream and the best ¬£60k I ever spent on a car‚Ä¶and there aren‚Äôt many of them.

"Mansory lots are decent quality in build but everyone should be aware that in 99% of cases they devalue the car, especially on purist cars like Aston‚Äôs (buyers typically don‚Äôt like after market additions).

Having said that, this probably one of the best upgrades I‚Äôve ever seen and the mansory kit really elevated the car. I don‚Äôt even want to know what it cost lol..

"Definitely like the front of this more than current model. It looks less like a Miata or Whale Shark, and more like the traditional Vantage",AstonMartin
"Also after comparing, I really like how the interior is like the db12's, but with more aggressive touches to reflect the car",AstonMartin
"I think yours (the middle one, 09 to 15 I think?) is the best. No 1990s phone buttons like mine but a more logical layout and more fitting with the rest of the interior than the one pictured.",AstonMartin

Counterpoint: Anything that makes you happy is a good investment,AstonMartin
"I just bought an MY18 DB11 V12, so was in your shoes for the past few months.

Putting aside all the regular, responsible things you need to do to figure out that you actually want to live with/own an Aston, what you're realistically looking at for $100K USD (I'm guessing?) is a pre owned 2019-2020 Vantage V8 or 2017-2019 DB11 V8 or V12. 

From my own research, those all roughly fall into the price segment, with variability based on mileage and options.

The 2021/22 MYs sit a bit higher in the price range, about $120K for a V8V and $150K+ for a DB

They are different cars. I started w the Vantage but fell in love with the DB11. Vantage is smaller, lighter, and more true sports car oriented in both driving dynamics and comfort whereas the DBs are Grand Touring focused. 

Your needs/wants are different than ours, so driven them back to back if you can!",AstonMartin
"It's the vents on either side of the grille. The One-77 has them and the DB12 looks kind of similar, although the vents flanking the grille on that car are lower in relation to the grille than they are here.",AstonMartin
How do you get one?,AstonMartin
"$45k is still too high given it‚Äôs an engine rebuild and needs significant interior work. 

The tail light isn‚Äôt an issue assuming it‚Äôs still working. It‚Äôs a diy fix. If the bulbs have gone then it‚Äôs $1k. 

Those are prices for going to an independent shop and good upholstery place.",AstonMartin
What a contrasting image. How beautiful is the Aston and how ugly the BMW.,AstonMartin
I‚Äôm in the UK. I was originally expecting to test drive late last year but heard nothing. I eventually chased and was told there were delays and offered my deposit back - it‚Äôs a bit weird as you‚Äôd think they want to sell the cars!?,AstonMartin
"If you need help with options pricing, I can price out your build! DM me the configuration code and I can get that for you",AstonMartin
oh dont get me wrong the green is GORGEOUS that grille is just hideous,AstonMartin
"My only ‚Äúproblem‚Äù if you could even call it one is the absence of the V12. Make no mistake I understand this is faster and better for the planet but Aston defines V12 IMO. As long as they have a V12 available in their line up, (presumably a DB12 with the old TT V12 or a new one put in place of the Mercedes V8) I‚Äôll be fine with it. I do agree with the consensus that this is the best looking ‚Äúmodern‚Äù Aston, meaning anything past the VH platform era of cars.",AstonMartin
Quite the Selection I see‚Ä¶,AstonMartin
Are you advocating for Porsche in an Aston subreddit?,AstonMartin
Try accelerating under kickdown/full throttle. If it is worse than usual have your driveshafts checked. Had one where the CV joint was broken inside.,AstonMartin
I don‚Äôt use a battery maintainer but the car does sit some times for longer periods. Because we have other cars. I will try to go back with this information to the dealer and try to figure it out. The vibrations start from around 45km/h and then it is constant I do feel that when I‚Äôm cornering hard and putting load on one side of the car the vibration stops and then on the straight it pick up again,AstonMartin
absolutely beautiful. Hopefully ill get to own one myself,AstonMartin

thanks for your reply, will look into it",AstonMartin
right but the DBS is a supercar. the DB12 is NOT a supercar its a grand tourer 700bhp is fine in a supercar but in a grand tourer its just unnecessary especially when it causes the whole front of the car to be ruined because of it also your point is redundant because Clarkson‚Äôs whole quote is dismantled by the fact he LOSES the race to Abby because his car has TOO MUCH POWER to use on the roads and he cant go fast because of it like did you not watch the full episode?,AstonMartin
"It‚Äôs $2000 per year for the annual service and that assuming nothing breaks or goes wrong but if you‚Äôre buying newer you can get it with a warranty. 

Also beat in mind that insurance (depending on where you live) is going to be high. My insurance is $2500 per year. Registration is $800 and it eats gas so your running costs are easily going to be $5k per year before gas.",AstonMartin

"I beg to differ. First Gen Gaydon cars are quite reliable. I have owned a 2005 DB9 for 8 years and have put on 10,000 miles (35k total). For me it's a weekend / good weather car only. We have an owners club with dozens of Astons in N. Calif. and the consensus is Astons are well engineered and durable. There's no dealer in town and I have done my own oil changes using OEM filter and full synthetic. The filter on left hand drive is a PIA to get to but doable. High performance tires are expensive as you'd expect. The only actual breakage I've had is a trans oil cooling line sprung a leak which was fixed by a local hydrolics shop for about $100. Though the special trans fluid is pretty pricey ($10/qt) and putting it in isn't easy. Insurance is a bit higher than a regular car as you'd expect, but not outrageous.

All that said, it's a joy to drive, the sound and acceleration are intoxicating. And it's so beautiful. For me, nothing else quite compares.",AstonMartin
The area for the torque tube would not fit a transmission.  You‚Äôd have to cut that out.  He‚Äôs right in saying that it would take so many modifications to make that work that it‚Äôs just not worth it.,AstonMartin
I got my factory condition V8VS with 3k miles for $65k 18 months ago. Best purchase I‚Äôve ever made,AstonMartin
"Mine has been very reliable. My maintenance has been done by local indie‚Äôs and a lot cheaper than what Doug paid. 

My only ‚Äúrepairs‚Äù have been wear/known items: door struts, airbag rattle fix (which I did in about 15 minutes). I did the thermostat as a preventative item (paid WAY less than Doug did). I changed every fluid in the car when I got it. 

Also, I question why he did the clutch right away. Was it slipping or did he just assume it needed to be done at that mileage? I would take YouTuber‚Äôs with a very skeptical grain of salt.",AstonMartin
"Admittedly, I haven‚Äôt driven any of these. But I drive a 911, and I understand the Cayenne GT is supposed to have superior handling and driver engagement (‚Äúfeel‚Äù) than any competitor. Of course, I‚Äôd have to test drive them all to confirm!",AstonMartin

Are you sure 2023 has Android Auto?  Our '23 707 doesn't as far as I can tell.  Its infotainment system seems identical to the one in our old 1913 DBX.,AstonMartin
"I‚Äôm shocked they still haven‚Äôt resolved this.  It‚Äôs a common issue and our 1/500 DBX had it.  It was an easy fix, but it‚Äôs been so long I don‚Äôt recall what it was.  Seen quite a few people report this over the years.",AstonMartin
"My thoughts exactly. That is what made me jump the gun on making this purchase. My original plan was to wait until April or so, so I could actually drive it in Alaska, but nope‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs coming the dead of winter because I‚Äôm impatient and it had three pedals. 6MT 4.7s come up for sale so rarely, and this one checked nearly all my boxes. So it‚Äôs going to just hang out in my garage for a few months.",AstonMartin
They finally got it right. Paying so much for a car with the interior they had before was not acceptable,AstonMartin
Did yall forget the VULCAN in the backround? Or is it forgotten like yesterday's news,AstonMartin

That‚Äôs incredible! So gorgeous,AstonMartin
"I‚Äôm fully in the camp that cars should be driven, but I also want to point out that the depreciation that ~will~ result from putting lots of miles on the car as a daily driver will likely be your biggest expense.

Just search ‚Äúhigh mileage‚Äù in this forum and you‚Äôll see  how mileage on Aston‚Äôs affects resale value much more than your average car, and how it can be difficult to sell a high mileage Aston.

no lol just something i was thinking about moving to the US and it was something i was curious about,AstonMartin
"Does he have an opportunity to store it dry and warm for free? Does he want to enjoy it or just store it away? It needs service every year (if stored away this is even more needed).

So I think it‚Äôs a tough gamble. I would only consider it for driving it a very few thousand km a year. It could keep it‚Äòs worth, so my ROI would be the enjoyment out of it.

"Since it is based on the MB infotainment, tons of third party CarPlay options that are basically plug and play. There are some that are unofficially approved by Aston, and won't affect your CPO. I had the dealer install it (paid some markup for it unfortunately), but they installed the unit that is approved by Aston for getting CarPlay running. 

After CarPlay has been installed, I don't even use the stock infotainment. It works fantastic and I love the car even more. Makes it super modern. It is Wireless CarPlay too, so even less hassle than current cars.",AstonMartin

"Everything I know about Aston‚Äôs is that they are built for at least 150k miles without replacement of non-wear parts. As the owner of an ultra low mileage DB9 (2011, 10k miles) I often admire the 130k+ mile DB9s I see around. The DB11 has some higher wear parts (turbos for one) than the rock solid V12 DB9, but I would imagine the rest of the quality would carry over. 

Buy with confidence. And if you‚Äôre really concerned about longevity and most smiles per dollar, look at a 2011+ DB9.

For reference, that DB11 at $69k is right around what I paid for my Storm Black 2011 DB9 with 7k miles.",AstonMartin
"Most likely DBS or the DB 12 engine with MH torque fill to provide some separation from lower models.

Wouldn't surprise me if they ditch the V12 entirely.",AstonMartin

"Absolutely. 

I think the brand that most needs to be used very sparingly is Ferrari. 

I don‚Äôt know why it has to be so, but either the engineering or the assembly (maybe both) seem to be so delicate as to be intended for very, very limited use. 

Beautiful cars, mostly, but there are few that survive even 50k miles without seeming to fall apart in one way or another, often in more than one aspect.",AstonMartin
"Will be nearly impossible to find all of the exact dimensions, and even if you can find a DB5 to measure up, you will be hard pressed to get exact curves. This is an unbelievably difficult task you signed up for and I would love to see what you end up doing.

I used Solidworks a few times to design parts for Porsches a while ago and that was pretty simple.   
I once took a few college courses on Solidworks and really enjoyed it, my final project was a Wankel Rotary engine. I've since changed fields but I loved modelling with exact geometry, for some reason it was very satisfying.",AstonMartin

I have a 24 cayman gts 4.0 for fun. The interior quality, attention to detail, and comfort (not haven driven it yet) is superior to the Cayenne.

"Will upload the images soon.

"At the cost and effort involved, you might as well buy another two cars that do this. Reading through the rest of the posts they covered most everything I was going to say, but this will ruin basically anything you like about the car and turn it into something entirely different/worse.

Yes it will be faster, fast as hell even, but that's really diminishing returns. The revised weight distribution is going to be much worse to drive than you think it is. Moving that engine forward and shifting the weight will end up with something crazy like 70/30 but worse it'll push like hell because it will be well over the front axle. Unless you're gutting the interior to make room for the front trans, which would destroy a perfectly good Aston and why not just build something similar on a cheaper body/frame that will require much less to accomplish the same goals.

Honestly if you have the GTR still just keep building that. As someone with 7 distinctly different vehicles, it's way more fun to find a role for each car and not try to make one car do everything you want. You should appreciate the Vantage for what it is- classy, faster than 99% of cars on the road, and surprisingly practical DD.",AstonMartin
"I've been looking at maybe getting one, but as mentioned, the high repair cost and maintenance scare me. Especially for something like a road trip, it would be scary. They're all low miles because they don't last much longer. And then there's fuel economy, and insurance..",AstonMartin

"I was cross shopping between the DB11 and the Vantage until I test drove a Vanquish. The DB11 leaned way more into being a GT/luxury car than the Vantage, and even more than the DB9 it replaced, which felt more sporty. It was really Bentley-esque in a way no other Aston I have driven was, IMO, to the detriment of the appeal of the car. Fast in a straight line, still looked great, but honestly, and I hate to say this about an Aston, just felt uninspiring during the drive. The final version of the DB9 is, to me, a more enjoyable car.

The Vantage was a genuine sports car. I had a blast driving it, and was more fun when you wanted it to be, but also worked perfectly well as a tourer or daily. I‚Äôm like you, I disliked the wire mesh grill, and almost didn‚Äôt consider the Vantage because of it. However, I discovered that Aston makes a [conversion kit](https://astonmartinworks.com/new-vantage-vane-grille/) to the vaned grille. It is sold via Aston Martin Works. You can buy it and have a body shop install it, or have it ordered by your dealership and installed.

I also had the opportunity to test drive a DB12 when the early production testers were on loan to my local dealer. That is an excellent car! It felt like a Vantage on steroids, bigger, more powerful, but just as athletic, and could still be a great touring car. IMO, also better looking than either the DB11 or Vantage. It gives the DBS Superleggera and the VH-era cars a run for their money.",AstonMartin
I‚Äôll take an E46 or E92 instead. Not sure what‚Äôs been happening with the recent BMW designs.,AstonMartin
"This is great advice.

One big repair job and you're screwed.  

OP,  I would be trying to find a pre-owned one that still has some factory warranty left.  You are able to extend the factory warranty out an additional 5 years if I recall.  These cars can get very expensive to maintain, very quickly.

"Ah, thank you so much! Could find that anywhere.

All those features are accounted for. The original build is pretty silly (so. many. little. things.) but the current price is attractive, as is the China Grey (I know, I know)

It‚Äôs definitely a DBS.,AstonMartin
yes i do and i also push back that the car needs 700bhp,AstonMartin

"Worth it.  That interior is the perfect spec (I wish my Vanquish had that color leather), and it looks immaculate.  As long as you keep up on the maintenance and don't beat the hell out of it, that car will last another 75k at least.",AstonMartin
"Maybe that something else is a souped up DB12, call me crazy but they could even call it a Vanquish or something",AstonMartin
The thing growing on me most about Aston Martin is that classic profile. A lot of auto makers have been giving in to more arrow dynamic looks.,AstonMartin
"If you have to ask, you can't afford it, lol. Also, a city passing laws that you can't own certain vehicles?  Sure am glad I'm not in Europe...",AstonMartin

2013 6MT. I‚Äôm terrified to drive it.,AstonMartin
"I have a 2012 V8VS.

Things to look for:

1. The dash leather will warp if it‚Äôs been left exposed for long periods to sunlight so that‚Äôs an obvious tell take that the car hasn‚Äôt been garaged.

2. The tail lights are prone to condensation. It‚Äôs a $15 kit from red pants and less than 1 hour to fix them, but if they‚Äôre already dead that‚Äôs at least a $1000 replacement .

3. The clutch will die at some point and typically 30k to 50k miles depending on how it‚Äôs been driven. There is a clutch wear Measurement that can be taken with AMDS but the starting point is arbitrary so it can be difficult to tell but a figure of over 1800 means it‚Äôs time or getting close to. A new twin plate clutch (which is better than the stock one) is about $8k all in.

4. The door locks can go but this hasn‚Äôt happened to me. They‚Äôre technically a Volvo analogous part so can be had for about $400.

5. Annual service is $1800 to $2200 at AM, maybe less at an Indy. The two year service is $3000. I had this done as I didn‚Äôt have the full service history of mine and it was incredibly low mileage (<3000) when I bought it a coupon of years ago. 

6. I had a weird gremlin with the key dock where it thought the key was in the dock when it wasn‚Äôt (so it wouldn‚Äôt lock the car). it plagued me for the best part of a year so I took it to AM service - they claim they didn‚Äôt do anything but it magically cleared up. I have a feeling they forgot to do a a software / firmware update during the major service months prior and then did it when I brought it back and played dumb. 

7. The boot struts also can fail over time and 19 years is about right. There cheap and say to replace however the re was a slight design flaw with the mounts and there‚Äôs a part you can buy to shore up the mounts on the bodywork. They cost $50 each and take 20 mins to install yourself.

8. The TPMS can fail over time as they are battery powered. They are not expensive but it means taking your wheels apart so labor isn‚Äôt insignificant. Probably $400-$500 all in. You can also just defat them and move without them if you don‚Äôt want to spend. 


Overall they are incredibly well build and solid cars, know as ‚Äúbulletproof‚Äù and speaking honestly, I‚Äôm calling out very minor and not unusual maintenance items. You can also do with to them yourself fairly easily at least for tasks that don‚Äôt require AMDS.

Get your local AM dealer to do a full PPI on it and call out the things I‚Äôve mentioned. I would also get an oil analysis done but a lot of dealers don‚Äôt do this. You can do it yourself with a kit that is sent to a lab but ask the dealer to save the oil they remove so you can send it off - give them the instructions for the kit so they know how to get the sample.m

Also demand that you get the physical skeleton key because of the fobs ever fail you will need this.",AstonMartin

"Don‚Äôt stress. I‚Äôve had a V8VS for two years now and the only maintenance things have been a full two year service at the dealer ($2600 - I needed to restart the service history) and a small fix to boot strut mounts. I had a weird issue for a few months with the ignition dock but it seems software updates and module test during that service solved. Other than that, rock solid.

"Are you an aston tech? If so, where?",AstonMartin
I had that version with the dogleg 7 speed. It was a hoot to drive but the quality of the car‚Äôs interior and the MB based command system really let the car down. I‚Äôm back with a 992 911S with a manual which I love. If AM offered a manual with this interior I‚Äôd def check it out.,AstonMartin
"Washington has been following California's emissions policies, and there is a chance that the vehicle would cross the border between the two states, so that makes sense, even if it was sent by flatbed. No, there is no break in service for Aston Martin's scheduled maintenance. You can elect to do that, but it would not be required.

Last but not least, yes, any recall work should have been done as it was in regards to foam blocks in the headliner which are part of United States Safety regulations. If there is no record of a fix, that should be checked as part of PPI. Message me directly if you want to ask about the TSBs.",AstonMartin
I definitely dig the purple finish.  I‚Äôm hoping we order one in this color for the new Vantage.,AstonMartin
"DB9s are terrific, but aging a bit now. If you want to set your hair on fire I‚Äôd recommend the new Vantage, 2019-2023. Fabulous sports car, surprisingly comfortable. There‚Äôs a twin exhaust option or a quad exhaust option which is just glorious. Go test drive them.",AstonMartin
It‚Äôll be interesting to see what the real price of the Vantage will be.  The DB12‚Äôs are coming in around $320-340K once properly configured which is an absurd price for that car.  I suspect the Vantage will be around $250K which will be ridiculous for a Vantage.  I‚Äôll be waiting to see what the used market looks like in a few years.,AstonMartin

I already have a fun sports car in the McLaren. So - a GT cruiser was a nice add.  I have the cayenne and panamera for daily duties.  Plus - rubicon if I want to take doors and top off to bring the tweens for fun little drives. They will get the JKUR to share when it‚Äôs time to drive in a few years.",AstonMartin

"It really depends on your repair budget and what kind of ownership experience you want.

The Aston will require far less overall, but what it does need will be expensive and specialist repair shops are few.

The Audi is more complex and will likely need more at comparable if not slightly lower prices, but your repair experience will likely be smoother and faster.

This is assuming that both are nominally functional and not on the verge of catastrophic failure, only needing standard maintenance to bring them back up to spec.

The Aston is a GT car and the R8 a sports car. Are you looking to blast around a track or do long road trips? Do you have other cars or is this going to be your driver? Have you owned an exotic previously? Do you have a garage? Can you have both cars inspected or is this a sight-unseen purchase?

Frankly I‚Äôm happy they‚Äôve retained this important part of their heritage.",AstonMartin
Congrats. Good decision.,AstonMartin
"Yeah I figured that dealers aren‚Äôt that pleasant to deal with, the community or the clientele that owns these vehicles tend to just own it for the brand and not for the vehicular enjoyment.",AstonMartin
Such a beautiful car. Congratulations.,AstonMartin
DB11 V12,AstonMartin
Well I thought I should first know the realities and options of owning one but apparently these are common knowledge in the glorious US ;),AstonMartin
I actually drove 2 of these on the same day back to back. Decided to go for the V8. The suspension tuning is also quite different on the V8 - makes it a more polished ride with better handling dynamics.,AstonMartin
That's James Bonds car irl right there.,AstonMartin
"One 77 is by far the most bespoke, interesting and expensive. Most powerful NA V12 for awhile.",AstonMartin
"At the price point of either I wasn‚Äôt worried about final dollar, I genuinely like the smaller (sportier) 2 seat vantage over the slightly larger 2+2 DB. It was an easy decision for me.",AstonMartin
"That looks right.  There is also Satin Xenon Grey, but it‚Äôs a flat/matte sheen

Here‚Äôs a Xenon Grey example for comparison

"Yeah, I wouldn't turn one down over that! ;)",AstonMartin
Yes I love manuals. And yes for the price the car is insane,AstonMartin
"I'd opt for the Vantage every time unless you're looking for a V12. The Vantage, handles better, is as comfy with the dampers, and can overall do everything the DB11 can but just slightly better.",AstonMartin
"That's a very, VERY late production model of the Newport-Pagnell V12 Vanquish **S**, which -- absent of the badge on the bootlid -- you can tell because it has the large navigation screen *above* the start button and transmission control buttons. With the exception of these late Vanquish S cars, classic Vanquish and Vanquish S had this laughably bad navigation screen near the bottom of the center stack. Imagine if [Tiger Electronics](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21136607/hasbro-tiger-electronics-lcd-handheld-games-xmen-sonic-transformers) made a navigation screen... that was it.

Very rare, very cool.",AstonMartin
Love it,AstonMartin
Yes,AstonMartin
"Nope, the current AMG GT and AMG SL I mentioned are both two door coupes on their own platform. They de facto replaced the S class coupe and the old GT and SL, with the 911 turbo as Mercedes' benchmark.

The AMG GT 4 door, which was sold alongside the old GT, is mostly unrelated to either and is really just a different style of (now last gen) E class albeit only with nicer trim and AMG powertrains, some of which do mirror the two door GTs. It de facto replaced the AMG versions of the CLS, which was also a ""4 door coupe"" based on the E class, but Mercedes probably wanted a slice of the Panamera's pie, hence the unique body and hybrid options",AstonMartin
"Last V12 Vantage

last V12 DBS

I'd be pissed if i bought the dbs 770 ultimate",AstonMartin
"As an owner, it is fantastic value. Infotainment was the only letdown, but I had that fixed by having CarPlay installed by my dealer. Use it all year round. Drives great with winter tires thru ice and snow no issues. Fantastic car. 

It has been so good that I had 2 friends who jumped ship from their 992s to the Vantage. Platform deserves more credit than it gets. Smiles per dollar with AM6 is too good right now. 

And it‚Äôs no slouch either..",AstonMartin
"Virage or DB9? Sorry, they‚Äôre so similar I can‚Äôt tell. Looks like a Virage. Stock for stock, either would actually give a G80 a run for its money, in design and performance.",AstonMartin
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Hopefully with the DBX doing so well they can add a 4 door DB style vehicle to the line up.,AstonMartin
"Nice... congrats! Do you do a lot of work on it yourself? Obviously, not everything can be done in one's garage, but still...",AstonMartin
so yes?,AstonMartin
"I wouldn't consider it to be a particularly good deal (and your friend's father way overpaid back in the day).

It is essentially a 2008 DB9 with some cosmetic options.  The only performance upgrade is that it was fitted with the Sports Pack which was an option for other DB9s at the time.  A limited edition of 124 cars is not actually a small number by Aston Martin standards.

Here's more info about it:

https://astonmartins.com/car/db9-lm/

And here's one which sold not too long ago for 45k GBP:

http://www.parkwayspecialistcars.co.uk/sold/car/aston-martin-db9-60-v12-le-mans-edition-2dr

I'd suggest looking around at other 2008 DB9s for sale to see what they are going for (compare the km on them too), and then decide if you feel it is worth the premium for this particular car.",AstonMartin
"Lmfao, right??",AstonMartin
Very simply the DB9 was so much better. And will continue to show this more as more time goes by,AstonMartin
"I'm currently cross shopping the two (V8s), against one another and the F-Type R and AMG GT, so I very much feel your question!

Putting those other two brands aside, overall driving dynamics put the Vantage ahead. It's smaller, lighter, and more nimble. It's the ""type"" of sports car I'm going after. That said, I love love love the more GT look of the DB11 (minus the +2 seats). Also, the interior of the DB is more upscale/less basic (don't get me started about the old gen MB infotainment across the whole lineup).

So, my heart leans toward the DB but the butt-o-meter definitely enjoys the driving dynamics of the V.",AstonMartin
Is there a tip or method to check for clutch wear on a manual car instead?,AstonMartin
R8. I at least have an Audi dealer around me when it starts to fall apart,AstonMartin
The dash has analog gauges instead of digital. Trash heap!,AstonMartin
If sport shift rear fuse box left hand side for volante right hand side for coupe in the trunk check fuse 8. Engine compartment fuse box I think fuse 15 25a is starter solenoid. Does vehicle show neutral when trying to start?,AstonMartin

"Do you plan on having any work done on it at the Works shop in Newport Pagnell? Either way, I'd love to see before and after.",AstonMartin
"That‚Äôs interesting. I know a lot of dealers install it after purchase, I didn‚Äôt know that you could get it from the factory, but it makes sense. You can get pretty much anything you want from Aston.",AstonMartin
"I own a highish mileage 2010. I love it. Most people have never seen one before. Reliable (so far, knock on wood), feels pretty fast, handles, comfortable, and so nice to look at. Does everything well. Great if you have small humans. I haven‚Äôt driven the other generations, but I used to own an E39 M5. At current prices they are roughly comparable. As sublime as the BMW was and as much as I miss it,  I dare say the Aston is the better car.",AstonMartin
"Suuuper unpopular opinion. There‚Äôs a lot more buyers looking for a luxury sports cars with aggressive styling than there are folks that think the grille is too big, or any other little nuance",AstonMartin
Where is this?,AstonMartin
Yes 100%,AstonMartin
">""None of them have any design language, automakers just stick their grill on them and call them an Aston/Maserati/Alfa etc.""

That‚Äôs still an opinion though. According to my tastes, most crossovers are too similar, and my tastes aren‚Äôt ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù An incorrect fact would be 2+2=5 or to say the car has 3 wheels.  These are nuances of human language.",AstonMartin
"Interesting, wanna know more. Not that I care at all about the Valkyrie, I think it‚Äôs silly for Aston be spending so much money on super cars. (Is it just me or does mid engine hyper car and Aston Martin just not go in the same sentence?) I wanna know what bad things are.",AstonMartin
I‚Äôm pretty upset they removed the painted diffuser option. I have the pre-facelift and the painted diffuser makes the back pop out in brighter colors.,AstonMartin
"Ya, art sold his one-77 and (I think) Vantage. Totally got out of aston martin because he was so upset with them. Don't know what happened.",AstonMartin
*HDMI port,AstonMartin
"Pink I believe. On second thought, maybe orange?",AstonMartin
"You have no idea about Aston's history then. We are triple crown winners and have a formula 1 team and a very very successful GT class team. Aston was made to be a mix of luxury and power. They have always had big horsepower. It's one of the things the company stands for. If 700 bhp is too much for you, then I suggest you try a different brand. Aston will only get faster and bigger. If you don't like front grilles, then I'd suggest electric cars or mid engines. That should help",AstonMartin

Glad to finally see an Aston with a proper interior.,AstonMartin
Congrats! Welcome to the club. You may want to check with your local dealer whether you can get an extension on the 10 year warranty. If the DOM is still close enough to the 10 year window they may allow it.,AstonMartin
Looks like a DBS Ultimate 770.,AstonMartin
"And I agree with you because you‚Äôre right.  I have a friend who took me in his e60 and it was vicious! But alas, even with all that, my friends and I still love the e39 more.  It‚Äôs weird I know.",AstonMartin
"Definitely get it checked out by a mechanic. Repairs are pretty expensive. Though engine/transmission is not outrageous. The body is probably the most outrageously expensive IMO. So also check for dents/paint etc.

Drive the car, especially if it‚Äôs a manual, and see if you like it. It can be a workout to drive if you‚Äôre used to a light clutch and steering. 

Other than that though, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it. 55k seems a bit high unless you‚Äôre getting a 420 or an S. But prices might be different in Europe, here a nice example will only get about $50-60k.

But I love my Vantage, it‚Äôs a great car. Everyone (here in the US at least) gets very excited to see one, they are pretty rare. And perhaps most importantly, I think they‚Äôre done depreciating. You won‚Äôt lose much, if anything, and maybe make money.

I‚Äôve had mine for about two years. I got it for $28k. Needless to say, I‚Äôve done a ton of my own repairs on it. Both engine and body. I probably have close to $20k in the car just from parts (and some labor I couldn‚Äôt do myself). So feel free to DM if you have any questions about it!",AstonMartin

"The best maintained VH platform Aston you can find in your budget.

For me that was a 2011 DB9. All of the 2009+ upgrades, plus adaptive dampers, but cost thousands less than a 2013 DB9 which had a number of changes I didn‚Äôt feel were as valuable as the added cost. 

Took a small portion of that money saved and had a full 2 stage paint correction done, 5 year ceramic coating applied, and installed apple CarPlay and F/R backup cameras (using oem nav screen), and changed all fluids in the car. 

It‚Äôs perfect. Didn‚Äôt consider a vantage because I wanted the extra room and rear seat of the DB9, which also has the V12 engine, oh god the engine.",AstonMartin

"Aston Sales here. This has happened a numerous amount of times to our DBX'[s.In](https://s.In) our case, its from the cars not being driven at our storage facility.  If this is from the car being stored without a trickle charger then it is just the battery from not being driven for a bit. If this is happening on a day to day basis then it is absolutely an issue that needs to be addressed.",AstonMartin
Everyone forgets Richard Hammond drove one in that color. Drifted it too,AstonMartin
"brilliant car, rubbish film.",AstonMartin
"There‚Äôs a couple of factors. Firstly the volantes are expensive to maintain so high mileage ones (which you‚Äôre undoubtedly looking at for those prices) are going to be lower, but secondly there‚Äôs a dip in pricing right because like some 80‚Äôs Ferraris were 10 years ago or 60‚Äôs Ferraris were in the late 70‚Äôs, they go slightly out of favor just due to timing etc. this is especially true when there‚Äôs a new Gen (I.e. DB12) as everyone wants the shiny. 

I think is as cheap as they get but they‚Äôre gorgeous cars that will rally in price again die to the design being such a classic. Give it 10 years and I think you‚Äôll see the price spring back up.",AstonMartin

"I don't know much on the Mercedes gearbox, but I'd assume this is a non-starter. The engine is entirely behind the front axle line in the Vantage so even to fit the gearbox you'd have to pull it a LONG way forward or it would be inside the cabin.

Going to a AWD configuration would presumably mean the engine almost entirely in-front of the axle, at which point I'd question it fitting within the bodywork.

For what its worth I ran my V12 Vantage S with 595bhp Performance Pack all year round in the UK, or I did once I'd ditched the suicidal Pirelli PZero Corsas. Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tyres transformed it, went from hating driving it in the cold or even damp summer conditions to almost a completely different car.

That would be my first step! A lot easier than re-engineering the whole car.",AstonMartin
"Volante, dark night, tan. Arriving in another couple months.",AstonMartin
"Wow, my bad, I was wrong ! My previous research of DBs rear looked very different. Thank you guys!",AstonMartin
Thank you so much!,AstonMartin
"It‚Äôs more the fact that you can get a current gen vantage for ¬£60-70k, which will definitely pull prices of the new gen downwards. The new gen is a very heavy facelift which solves a lot of issues that people have with the current gen, but it‚Äôs still in essence the same car, so the ¬£60-70k provides a low reference point which drags the value down. 

Essentially, there just can‚Äôt be a sustainable ¬£100k difference between the two generations, the market won‚Äôt tolerate it for that long because a rational consumer would always choose the cheaper trade off. I would estimate that these will be within reach at ¬£120k within 6 months of deliveries starting.",AstonMartin

"Vantage owner here too and confirm, weak battery will cause all sorts of gremlins in Aston‚Äôs - I had a false key in ignition error and it went away with a high current full battery charge and a module reset. 

Having said that, I would strongly suggest at least jacking up the car to look for the damage to the undercarriage. There are skid plates for most of the underside but if you see heavy damage like a large dent it would need to be investigated further.",AstonMartin

Hawt damn!,AstonMartin
Lucky you!,AstonMartin
I totally feel you! The F-Type R is a lot more subtle too which is massive + for me. I love being under the radar. You're 100% right about the GT look of the DB11 - it has that traditional Aston feel to it with those beautiful 812-ish headlights. Front end of the Vantage isn't my favorite but I do love the duck rear-end taillights. Its definitely no easy option to pick between.,AstonMartin
"Torque tube is quite a lot smaller than the gear box . There is a very narrow cutout/ down the middle under the car that the torque tube fits in very tightly . Overall look at the height/ size of the dbx compared to a vantage . 
The chassis and cross bars sit right in front of the engine so no way of shifting it forward without cutting it out/extending the front of the car. I like your idea but it‚Äôs so much work that the car would not be a vantage anymore ! Buy an AWD huracan and have both cars üòÇ",AstonMartin
Good. Just maybe when I'm ready I can get a '17 Vantage at a good price in a few years ;) (wishing),AstonMartin
"I only recently got mine - less than a year. So not much data yet.  I get about 18mpg so consider that if you using it for a daily driver. I did have the head unit fail right on the day of delivery (replaced under warranty - it‚Äôs a known issue).  I have budgeted about $10k per year for maintenance including the AM annual warranty and $2-3k for the 10k mile periodic maintenance plus the usual bits and pieces. 

I would definitely buy from a dealer where you can get the AM warranty but that‚Äôs just my personal preference.",AstonMartin
"Talk to someone at Aston Martin, not the dealer.  If it was normal, it wouldn't be called a Malfunction",AstonMartin

If you told me I had to drive from Boston to LA tomorrow quickly, I'd take a Range Rover...but if it had to be a coupe for under $150k, it'd probably be an S63 Coupe, or maybe a Wraith if I could find a good one...

Seriously nice spec. The wood and the leather colour (with dark dash!) is really doing it for me.,AstonMartin
You can but you really don‚Äôt want to. Unless you are 20 years old and just want to do it. It‚Äôs just kind of annoying to drive a super nice car sometimes. But maybe I‚Äôm just old and tired lol,AstonMartin
"No, it stays in park. Can‚Äôt shift into N",AstonMartin
You could have anything you wanted in the interior materials for no extra cost.,AstonMartin
"I was looking forward to a CPO‚Äôd DB12 in a few years, but honestly I may just pony up and get a new V8V.",AstonMartin
what're all those things sticking down along the bottom? Lose 'em.,AstonMartin
Where do you live?,AstonMartin
Drive with the top down and you will end up bald,AstonMartin
"Thanks, the m440i is also a nice car. My dream is to have the M4 and a 2019-2020 Aston Martin Vantage together.",AstonMartin
Definitely not Morning Frost. That‚Äôs more of a pearl white-like color,AstonMartin
"I thought it was a good deal. Not stolen, but obviously above the sellers reserve. There are more expensive, older, with more miles and sport shifts for sale currently, so I‚Äôm actually pretty stoked on the price.",AstonMartin
I'll take the Vanquish ;),AstonMartin
It makes them go faster though?,AstonMartin
Andddd purple is ‚Äúno‚Äù from me,AstonMartin
Did you really censor butt,AstonMartin
What are you even doing here if that‚Äôs your take away?,AstonMartin
"Excellent way to start my morning, seeing the most beautiful Aston of all time with a pretty background and a plane. Hope that‚Äôs me one day .",AstonMartin
That colour is perfection,AstonMartin
"Nice car‚Ä¶but I can‚Äôt help to think are they destined to die seen the eco necessities, ever greater lack of space and the fact that such cars are just senseless around urban areas ?",AstonMartin
It wouldn‚Äôt be hard üòÇ,AstonMartin
All the Vantages we examined for the pixel version seemed originals. But we'll doublecheck it next time. Thank you for noticing the small details.,AstonMartin
"Here is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstonMartin/s/6i66V9QCg2) to my two comments on common DB11 issues for V8s and V12s, I'm personally not sure how I feel about that high a car mileage, but these cars are overall pretty reliable and do best being frequently driven.",AstonMartin
69 pesos. Broke the bank.,AstonMartin
I prefer the DB11 to the DB12 looks wise,AstonMartin
"Lucky you! Around here $800k gets one in the middle of nowhere, that has covenants that prevent you living full time. You can add another $500k to be close to town or the water. üòî",AstonMartin
Yeah idk whats up with that color choice.,AstonMartin
"Yes, bring back the Vanquish! That would be a great way to end the V12 flagship for Aston Martin. It seems to be a trend now, since the original Vanquish, that they alternate the Vanquish and DBS nameplates for the flagship model.",AstonMartin
Db11 v12 owner entered the wrong thread... nope the 9 or v8s don't compare.,AstonMartin
Great list. Curious why no mention of the db9,AstonMartin
Is your name winston? I don‚Äôt remember asking,AstonMartin
"Damn, I really want the cc brakes, I hope skipping the carbon roof will keep things down haha. Also hoping we don't see these hitting the market for 100k in two years. Good luck and congrats :)",AstonMartin
"As an American, can someone kindly explain the comma and decimal point in the price?",AstonMartin
"I‚Äôd argue Aston is a Lamborghini competitor given that many owners of both track test their cars. The DB12 is designed to be a performance car, not race spec, but it could race if it wanted to with the CC disks, Michelin pilot sport tires, and a lot of other things. Also big engine = big air consumption given its NA, ergo a big grill. 

They aren‚Äôt giving these cars the amount of HP they have just for shits and giggles, they make them that way so people have the option to do so if they wanted, again with the somewhat race-esque features. And if I‚Äôm paying 200k+ for a car with 700hp, imma fucking use the 700hp 

Also this is, by definition, a supercar btw",AstonMartin
I bet this is related to the car being less rare since they're making a roofless version and didn't tell original buyers. Or the original buyers don't get an automatic allocation.,AstonMartin
Which dealership?,AstonMartin
"Amazing work. You're very talented.

Can I commission your services?",AstonMartin
literally the most beautiful cars ever made,AstonMartin
"If you want the luxury of an Aston and more practicality than the 2 door models, it is a wonderful car! The interior and exterior were designed immaculately, they are very enjoyable to drive, and are reliable when maintained. Don't expect full size adults to be comfortable in the rear seats, but otherwise the car works as intended. The older Rapides do not have some of the performance upgrades of the S, but it still has that glorious V12 to enjoy. Some people prefer the longer gears of the older model for cruising and trips as it has 6 gears instead of 8. Try to look for a car that has a well documented history without any major electrical faults. The cars that started solid have remained so, but there have been rare cases where one car was an electronic lemon.

I personally love the Rapides because they are unique and the styling carries what I like from a DB9 and meshes it with a Lagonda like front end. There is a Facebook group I am part of called ""Aston Martin Rapide Enthusiasts"" and it is willing to help both current owners and prospective buyers if you have more questions. We love these cars, and try to keep them as long as each owner can.",AstonMartin
Sweet car man! really dig the green,AstonMartin
"I‚Äôd reach out to a lawyer. 

If you have documentation on the claims from the dealership this‚Äôll help.",AstonMartin
"Hers is the DBX mine is the DBX 707, I‚Äôve bought it as an upgrade. I‚Äôm either solving the issue or selling it üòÖ",AstonMartin
"I think a V8 Vantage from like 2008-2009. Manual gearbox if you want something sporty, automatic for a GT.  
Another choice could be the DB7 V8. That‚Äôs the same V8 as in the XKR, great sound, and more economical (as a V8 can be‚Ä¶) than the V12. Plus, even if the reliability of the V12 isn‚Äôt that bad, the annual cost is much higher than the V8.

Last but not least is the Rapide. Be careful, the maintenance costs are the highest on this list. But! The Rapide is a reliable V12 sedan, that's pretty fast, but less than a Continental. The sound is magical! And it is really exotic, you won't see the same Rapide as yours, for sure.",AstonMartin
"Yes! Dual Motor so now worries there. 

And totally agree with you. Feel like you never know with the winters here. 

I still haven‚Äôt ruled out a nor‚Äôeaster in March. üòÖ",AstonMartin
I busted,AstonMartin
Lotta love for Harry‚Äôs Garage.,AstonMartin
"I was able to negotiate the first year as including the purchase price.  I realize they really just dropped the purchase price and added it back in, but I did get a minor sales tax advantage the way the deal was structured",AstonMartin
Following with interest!,AstonMartin
A Prius,AstonMartin
You know it!,AstonMartin
Because it's one of the few areas of a vehicle that the artist/designer can be bold without being hindered by technical limitations. It's also the area with the most real estate for a brand to make it's statement/identify itself.,AstonMartin
"Next time you are driving and hear the noise, try pressing on the panels around the area of the noise and see if you can pinpoint it. I'll warn you though, it might not be coming from anywhere near where you think. Sound reverberates around the cabin making it difficult. For months I tried to track down an intermittent noise that I was certain was coming from the passenger footwell when I accidently found the roof panel had separated from the glue right above my head.",AstonMartin
I bought a launch edition DB11 v12 in the last 6 months with  @8k miles as a daily and love it. Made sure I had complete history beforehand. Insurance was a bit of an issue since I have children that are driving age at home and we had to separate them on a different carrier. Make sure your carrier will insure Astons - some will not. I estimate $2000 for the annual service - I plan to go to the local dealer where it was serviced by the first owner. No problems at all. Makes the commute something I look forward to.,AstonMartin
Oh yeah I know. I misspoke‚Ä¶i‚Äôm too poor at the moment.,AstonMartin
Ha good point! I‚Äôll be driving it a lot this year for sure. We got it with 26000 miles or so last spring and have put close to 2000 on since.,AstonMartin
Do you have a link?,AstonMartin
"Yes. The system is garbage, even Mercedes ditched it a few years ago. Further, the Aston version is the first gen that doesn‚Äôt even have CarPlay. You‚Äôll have trouble connecting your phone, if it connects at all, usb or bluetooth. It‚Äôs an archaic system, designed to be used with iPods. If you use a streaming music subscription like Spotify, you‚Äôll have to close out and reopen the app several times trying to get the system to connect, if it does at all. Make sure your volume is down on your phone and the car while you attempt to connect if you value your eardrums. Several other aspects of the system range from cumbersome to infuriating. If it‚Äôs your daily driver, you‚Äôll probably end up hating it. 24+ models have been overhauled, finally. See if the dealer will let you take it out for a few hours and just try doing normal, everyday things while driving around. 
Here is an article that explains it but doesn‚Äôt really go into how bad it is.

"We need someone who can fabricate parts for it, a reall good mechanic to install them, an old priest and a young priest, because I shudder to think what's wrong with the wiring harness",AstonMartin
I have a 2015 v8 vantage I've owned for 3 years.  Easy to do brakes yourself as well as some other maintenance.   Check out redpants.lol for how to videos. Overall very affordable car to own. I've put 20k miles on mine and spent under 2500 including a new battery and a dealer visit before I wised up and found an indie shop for service.,AstonMartin
Buy.,AstonMartin
Track a V8 DB11 ? I mean to each their own but..,AstonMartin
Definitely cannot understate the importance of keeping the wife happy üòÖ Thanks for your response!,AstonMartin
Any more pics?,AstonMartin
"I owned the e34 m5 and e39 m5.  E34 was a BLAST to drive.  E60 - just didn‚Äôt feel the same. Just felt bigger and porkier.  Quick - but not ‚Äònimble‚Äô. That‚Äôs when I went to porsche.  Seriously looking at an AM to add. I love how the db9 and db11 look.  

Rapide s might be better for kid hauling.",AstonMartin
Which dealer and what did they do specifically to be useless?,AstonMartin
"Nailed it.  
  
Some good third-party information sources:

- Bookmark the Aston Martin page of ScuderiaCarParts.com -- great way to find exploded parts diagrams and part numbers (which you can cross-reference with cheaper FoMoCo items where available)
- Sign up for the Aston Martin V8/V12 Owners Group on Facebook (I know, I hate Facebook too). It's a really good source of information from fellow owners.


Also, check if your 2012 has four or six-piston front brakes. Six-piston calipers are fantastic for stopping power but the discs they use are expensive to replace. The four-pistons aren't nearly as good for heavy duty service, but they are fantastically economical to replace as there's a Brembo reference P/N.",AstonMartin
"in 2019 Ferrari's ""flagship"" \[if you can call it that\] was the 812 Superfast which makes \~800hp and is a completely different experience than the GT qualities of the Aston Martin DBS.

btw, read the first sentence of the wiki article about the DBS: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston\_Martin\_DBS\_Superleggera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_DBS_Superleggera)

""The Aston Martin DBS Superleggera, also sold as the Aston Martin DBS, is a grand touring car produced by British manufacturer Aston Martin since 2018.""",AstonMartin
DBS,AstonMartin
It's Astons track car. They wanted it to be that.,AstonMartin
Certainly not standard Xenon Grey.,AstonMartin
"Amazing! I am also considering my first Aston! Are you making the same trade off between waiting to see the 992.2 and its pricing? Or have you fully decided already?

I love your build by the way!",AstonMartin
