"I don’t think you understand my point. 

The non-monthly cost for FSD is massive, and a common pain point with everyone here. It wasn’t ever supposed to be transferable, but Tesla started to allow it temporarily to increase sales, since if you spent 6 or 10 or 12 thousand dollars on this feature with your last car, what is your incentive to get a new one just a few years later and have to buy it again? 

If they give a cheaper lump sum option that sticks with the car,and can’t be transferred, it will cause more people to pull the trigger, . If they make the current $12k price bound to the owner, that’s a more expensive win-win option that will highly motivate people to get another Tesla down the road.

"I’m all for other cars using SC, I just wish it could be done without lengthening the cables. One thing that makes SCs superior to other public charging is the short cables. Long cables drag on the ground and get dirty, run over / damaged, twisted, and utlimately not put away. I used to carry disposable gloves in my EV just to handle them and got many pants dirty from encounters with dirty and unruly charging cables.

SCs though the cables don’t get very dirty at all and because of the short length, you rarely have to touch the cable itself - just the connector. Because of the design, they are almost always properly put away between use and don’t get twisted or damaged from laying on the ground.

Ideally, Tesla should require cars to have their charge port on the rear-left side for SC access. Or charge more to cars that have to block two lanes because of sub-optimal port location.",teslamotors

"I just got to a part in the biography that really confirms what I am thinking.  Where the engineers started to use a neural network (NN) over programmatical management (PM) for decisions in the car, and how the NN was orders of magnitude more advanced than PM. And this is with a few million videos of drivers.  And all the way up to 12.3, it has been off 1.5 billion videos per day. The difference between early FSD and 12.3 is pretty dramatic. I can only imagine how well the NN would improve with a 10x or 100x ingestion of video.

I know though, that from my experiences in building Language Models, NN, and traditional logic engines, that much extra data won't lead to that much extra results in improvement.  At this point, I think it would be much better at typical scenarios, and a lot better in niche or edge case scenarios.",teslamotors

"Similar things have happened to me on FSD beta since they merged highway and surface street stacks. It would constantly dive into exit lanes and ramps even though I should've been going straight.

I had one where I let it make the left turn, and it just rerouted around the block twice, it made the wrong turn 3 times before I figured it'd just do that forever.

"I don't think the previous one was traction limited either, but from what I understand it was basically *at* the limit, so w/ the beefier rear motor, the increase in width was definitely needed. 

Have to think it might actually be down a little on range, as with the larger rear lip spoiler/underbody downforce element, ducting up front, etc. it'll erase all of the post-refresh Cd gains and probably then some(in favor of downforce/brake cooling).
So combine that with an 80mm wider cumulative contact patch out back and no weight loss or new battery to gain efficiency from, and it's likely gonna have a shorter range. 

But if it's gonna be a sub 3 sec car to 60 by a comfy margin and do the 1/4 mile in the 10s? I'll take the small range tradeoff all day, it's really not gonna change my daily driving/charging at all, and I'll probably still stop at all the same Supercharging intervals I would in my MYLR.

**Update**: Drove another ~2.5 hours. Three(?) disengagements. Previously I couldn’t even make it a mile around here in the city limits. Overall happy with this progress 

1. Turning off “Auto Speed” while driving bumped my Max Speed to 85mph in a 55mph zone. Couldn’t decrease it. The car didn’t start to go that fast, but I disengaged and re-engaged just to be safe. 

2. Smoothly stopped at a red light… Light turns green, box-truck in front of me is taking a millennium to get up to speed, FSD seemed like it assumed the car would be going faster in that amount of time and started to quickly accelerate, I’d say I was less than a car length behind. Quickly disengaged

"> Personally I find buttons such as the turn signals to be as easy as the stalk in regards to muscle memory and swiftness to initiate.

The turn signals are not my favorite example here, because the touch aspect isn't what I think is their primary issue.  They're actually pretty good touch controls.  It's that they're located on the rotating wheel face, but their use is legally required in situations where the wheel is not in a fixed orientation.  

Touch buttons located on fixed ""paddles"" behind the wheel or something like that would fix the critical issue.  But on the 3, at least, there are only a few controls located there and they are near an identifiable reference point you can identify by touch.  The control itself does not necessarily need to be identifiable by touch if its location is identifiable by touch due to other nearby shapes.  On the 3, they're the leftmost buttons, with a raised divider, and just left of the thumbwheel.  They're easy to find and identify by touch, and honestly not bad as touch controls.  But they're on the wheel face, which is not great for situations like ""signalling a lane change while driving on a curving road"" or ""exiting a roundabout.""

But since that's an entirely separate issue from touch controls, I don't want to go too far down that rabbit hole in an article about touch controls specifically.  As touch controls go, they're pretty good!  As turn signals go, I think they're a bad idea... but not specifically because they're capacitive touch sensors.",teslamotors

I've seen V12 perform much better in situations when following lines strictly isn't the best way to go. I'll find you an example later.

Yeah, there are definitely situations when hugging the inside of the curve isn't the best way to do it. But I think it's good behavior in many cases. I don't think I've seen a good example of V12 not hugging the inside line when it's not safe to do so. I'll keep a lookout for you.",teslamotors

If you drive a car, you'll also be much safer in a collision with a motorcycle. One person voluntarily takes on the higher risk, while every other participant in traffic benefits. Why should this be illegal? To be blunt, motorcycle riders are mostly killing themselves, not others.

An SUV and especially the gigantic US pickup trucks make traffic less safe for everyone around them. Pedestrians and other drivers in regular cars are more likely to die in accidents against them. But if we simply outlaw them, the risk for the theoretical pickup driver increases marginally, while everyone else is safer. That's a net benefit for society.

In the long term, it also stops the arms race. More big trucks on the road motivate more people to also get big trucks, to gain some additional safety. But if there are no trucks on the road and the option doesn't exist, everyone is safer in the end.",teslamotors

I believe that what's gonna drive better and more sustainable transportation is dense places built for walking, cycling and public transit with shared electric cars in addition. This alone is not in Teslas best interests because they still want you to be car dependent, just on their electric cars.

Hell I know small business owners who became big business owners who would pretty much sleep at work just to make the company grow in its initial days. It takes a lot to get a company going.

"Slower and heavier than the NCA I test drove. The acceleration isn't even in the same ballpark. It's fine I guess, still faster than ICE, but it's not the car I thought I was buying at the test drive. When they announced the LFP packs I even asked my sales advisor (as I waited for delivery day) if I was going to get an LFP pack and he assured me that we weren't getting them in Canada because they perform worse in the cold. Well, come delivery day, it was LFP.

So, aside from it being slower (a genuine gripe), it also REALLY loses range in the cold, I'm talking 50% range loss at least (below -30c), and it take ages to precondition for supercharging which it won't even do if the battery is really frosty. I've had charge rates in the winter of 8kW or less (preconditioned!), or even a period of time where it failed to charge at all. I got tired of paying $/min for charging for it to warm the battery and left after 30 minutes while getting a grand total of zero kWh in the battery despite paying a $5.00 for the pleasure of it. I know NCA would also struggle at those temps, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have hit ""failed to charge.""

Also, despite the talk of it being a longer-lasting battery, I've lost about 40km of max range in my two years of ownership, which is about on par with NCA anyway, despite babying the battery. So, aside from it being safer from thermal runaway, it really does seem to me like a downgrade in most other aspects, unfortunately.",teslamotors

So you don't have to rely on ground that can take stakes, or find a nice clear tent pad free of rocks or roots. So you don't have to contend with a wet tent pad at teardown or worry about the wrong kinds of pests crawling into your tent. So you have a suspended floor that is softer than the ground as the base for your sleeping pads and bags.

But I always assumed that the main reason was so you could vent the climate control from the car into the tent. If that's not on offer here, then it seems way less useful.

It also works better when its working. But man that thing is being an idiot with ramp changes big time. 

Getting on the highway yesterday, it pulled into the lane, then didnt realize it was in it and went to pull into the lane, ie into the grassy shoulder. V11 never did that in that spot ever. 

Getting off the highway, was following another car who also got off there. Instead of following other car into the offramp, it pulled up beside it and kept speed , right as it was getting to where the ramp was going to break away from the highway it tried merging, realized what it did, then tried swerving back into the highway lane. It would have hit the car behind me if i didnt force it across the striped triangle. V11 always would just slot in behind the lead car if they were also taking the exit, and always seemed to attempt to enter the exit earliest possible, v12 is latest possible. 

In a few spots it has treated a right turn only lane as ""oh this is just a passing lane added for cars in the main lane wanting to turn left to be went around"" the car does realize what its doing once it hits the intersection and turns right and exits the gps route.

The NHTSA requires that Teslas operate according to the requirements around stop signs: full stop for up to 3 seconds at the line where the stop sign is located, then creep forward, stop again for confirmation of clarity, then go/turn after confirmed visual.

The problem is that Tesla has gone back to them with evidence that 99.5% of the time, humans don't even stop and roll through the stop signs.

The main concerns were obviously the limited locations and also battery degradation. We’re seeing this right now with Nio, where you can go in to swap the battery instead of charging, and you go from your brand new battery with 2% degradation, to receive one with 21%, and now you suddenly have less range.

According to the eligibility requirements, you must have owned at least 500 TSLA shares as of February 29, 2024, and have had at least 50% (or 250) of those shares as of February 28, 2021.

You know what it also proved? Depending on the car, the ""pressure"" equalising doesn't even have to correlate with you not having breathing space, Richard needed oxygen because he ran out of air but still couldn't open the door.

Step 1 is opening the door instantly as hard as you can, if the water is just below halfway up, it will work

Step 2 is trying to break a window and crawl out

My guess, and since this article contains little-to-no information or context, is that the executives are paid largely in Tesla shares. Spoiler alert, Tesla shares have gone up in the last 5 years and shares are not taxable until sold (Edit: depending on the type of stock, it may be taxable income when awarded, however that income tax would apply to the individual, not the company which further proves this article is disingenuous).


As to Tesla, the company, I imagine they are taking advantage of whatever tax breaks are offered. Shocker.


Also, is there some moral rule I missed where a company should pay more federal income taxes than it pays C-suite level people? Hell, this article's title probably could also read ""Tesla pays non C-Suite employees more than it pays in taxes"", right?


Maybe look to see how much Tesla paid into social security or Medicare, eh? Cherry picking on type of tax to insinuate Tesla pays no taxes at all is disingenuous. 


Finally, for fun, Google Elon's tax bill in 2021. Anytime someone tells you ""billionaires don't pay taxes"", remind them of the time that Elon paid more taxes in a year than their entire family tree has paid in 500 years.

The short cables mean they aren’t getting left on the ground, run over, run to an adjacent spot, etc. 

Once they do longer cables, there will likely be more damaged chargers (even adding a retractor on a cable that can reach the front of a car is still pretty significant, some gas stations do it, but there’s a lot of structure around that). 
Also, with longer cables, you’ll have more times when a cable is run to an adjacent spot and so it will be harder to find a spot with a cable.

Anyway, its gotten about 255 miles per charge cycle, so with the cell rating of 1500 cycles, that brings my car to 382k miles as rated.

"From the article: Tesla is mobilizing support against legislative efforts that threatens how the company operates in Oklahoma. While Tesla is still not allowed to sell directly to consumers in Oklahoma, two bills, Senate Bill (SB) 2022 and House Bill (HB) 3104, could take it one step further, forcing the automaker to close its gallery locations in the state.

Tesla’s sales model, which bypasses traditional dealership networks in favor of direct sales to customers, has long been a point of contention in numerous states. The current legislative framework in Oklahoma requires Tesla to operate galleries instead of full-fledged stores, limiting direct sales and focusing on providing educational and informational activities about Tesla’s products.

The new bills however are seeking to take it even further, potentially banning these informational activities and jeopardizing Tesla’s ability to operate in the state altogether.

*Companion bills SB 2022 and HB 3104, detrimental bills that could jeopardize Tesla’s ability to continue to operate galleries in Oklahoma, are currently being considered by the State Legislature.

But if you also specifically record any time a user overrides the auto wipers, then you're going to get the edge cases where it fails too. And you should end up with a strictly superior product. But if you don't for whatever reason (like, say, the assumptions on what the existing cameras can reliably recognize was wrong), you just quietly fall back to relying on the sensor.

Okay let us know when FSD has the equivalent of a human brain behind it. Right now it does nothing more than pattern recognition (machine learning). Human cognition is FAR more advanced and we have the ability to reason. Analogical reasoning and planning are some of our biggest strengths. We can map solutions from old problems to problems we have never encountered and plan a complex set of actions in a split second. We have far more complex world models that we can use to make decisions. We deal with edge cases very well. Sorry but we simply don’t have AGI behind the wheel in FSD.

Marques explaining how early production VINs of new vehicle models will typically have issues is not a negative review, it's just a statement of fact that applies not only to Tesla but all car manufacturers. In fact it's not just car manufacturers, but any manufacturer of a complex product. Look at Apple's VR headset for example. Marques covers this as well on his Waveform podcast, but the glass is literally cracking. And that's from Apple! Or how about Samsung? Remember when their smartphones had to be banned from planes because the battery could catch on fire?

I think Marques' review was more positive than negative. In fact i can't really think of anything negative he had to say about it. Factory operator problems aside, he pointed out a few design decisions that *seem* odd at first glance, but aren't actually a problem (like the sunvisor which has tinted glass above it).",teslamotors

Trucks being able to automatically deliver loads, GrubHub not needing drivers.




 Real level 5 is worth an unfathomable amount of money. A single license is worth a lot, but level 5 in its entirety is worth trillions.

"Sure, but even having it take over more and more driving responsibility while under supervision is useful.


I don't have to worry about keeping the car centered in the lane. And the car knows where all the upcoming turns are so I'm not suddenly scrambling to take a turn I almost missed.


Plus just having an extra set of eyes when doing mundane driving tasks is helpful too. Someone to double checking for cross-traffic and pedestrians when taking turns. Someone to keep an extra eye on blindspots when making lane changes. Someone to double check when accelerating or when driving in traffic to prevent rear-ending someone.


A lot of those are also possible piecemeal with other ADAS systems, but having all of them is very nice as we slowly approach 100%.


In a lot of cases now I'm the one who is doing the double checking too, which may not eliminate stress but definitely changes it. I personally feel like it's a reduction, but I understand how some people really stress out about relinquishing control.",teslamotors

In everyday driving, most of your power drain will come from HVAC and motors, so I doubt you’ll see much of that power saving carry over, as the overall pie got bigger, the sentry drain is now a tiny slice.

Another example of you can be right and have no ethics at the same time.  FSD is a fraud that Elon and Tesla has been trading on for years and one that cost me $10k before I woke up and stopped giving them money for a product that wasn’t ready for market.  It’s going to be good some day I’m sure but five years ago we were supposed to see an uninterrupted trip from LA to NYC and we still appear to be several more years away from that.  We’ve been a “year away” since 2016 and my third model three does less than the first one did and is overall a worse experience.,teslamotors
"EDIT: I started to find direct links to the ads that I'm posting below :)

Almost missed this playing in the background between YT videos today when it dawned on me that I've never seen direct advertising from Tesla before. Maybe it's a limited-time thing but I thought I'd heard them mention the ""$0"" ad budget before.

Guess they're switching gears. From yesterday's AP article linked below:

>When another shareholder suggested that Tesla try advertising, Musk said he is open to it.“This has some merit,” he said to the shareholder at the meeting at Tesla’s factory site near Austin, Texas. “We’ll try a little advertising and see how it goes.”

I've seen several different ads so far that I'll list here as they come out. In general they've been produced very well:

1. Model Y ad that focuses on long range capabilities and SUV'ish features  
[https://youtu.be/M7IITbRhn-k](https://youtu.be/M7IITbRhn-k)
2. Snow driving performance ad that basically highlights the platform's traction control.
3. Cybertruck ad talking about long range (""real world"") testing along the Baja 1000 course.
4. Trip Planner / Super Charging

"It’s much more common to slow down to avoid an accident. But not as uncommon as you’d think to have to speed up to avoid an accident. There have been at least 7-10 situations specifically in my almost 30yrs of driving where deer were headed for my front quarter panel or side of my car and I missed them due to speeding up. Deer are a huge problem in the US. There are more than 1.5 million vehicle and deer collisions in the US every year. I remember one evening where we were on vacation in the mountains where in the span of just 20 miles I had to dodge 3 deer. Two of them were avoided by speeding up. The 3rd time I had to slam on the brakes. Also there have been at least 3 situations where the person behind me wasn’t paying attention and I sped up and changed lanes to avoid being rear ended. One was really bad where the driver of a big truck plowed into the car in front of me at 60mph that would have been me had I not sped up and moved. 

Also in the US you can take a defensive driving course to lower your car insurance costs. I just did it about 2 months ago because insurance for Tesla’s are very high. In that defensive driving course there is a whole section on taking the path of least resistance that talks about times where speeding up is the correct decision.",teslamotors

"I meant inefficient under a physics point of view. Rocket engines are very inefficient and cold gas thrusters are on the lower end of that already low efficiency: for example, Falcon's main engines have a specific impulse of 300s; space shuttle's? 450s; an average airliner engine? Several thousands to tens of thousands; cold gas thrusters? 60s. SpaceX uses them just because they're safer than the alternative (hydrazin, which is extremely carcinogenic).


The rocket equation tells us that the weight added for such a system gives much more traction than the amount given by the CGT themselves, but slows the vehicle down more than not having it installed at all. Some cars (dragster, sport cars) do use upward firing exhaust to increase traction, but effect is very limited and that requires no added hardware so why not?

If you get a tattoo of Canada, yoy put it on your ass, so that every time you sit down, Quebec separates.

Quebec being different is to bane of most Canadians' existence.

I generally refer to this site: https://www.osler.com/en/resources/regulations/2023/automatic-renewals-in-canadian-consumer-protection-law for subscription consumer protections, it gives a general over view.

You can Google into it more, but there's provisions like the cell phone companies need to inform you in writing if they're gonna mess with your phone contract, and in some cases they don't allow auto renewing annual contracts.  They allow annual ones, they just can't renew.

Canada has is very consumer protectionist, as opposed to the US.  *Generally* the supreme court will side with consumers, not corporations and such when it comes to someone being wronged.

It's interesting to dig into and such.  Lots of bits where people look at how it is in the US and go ""Why isn't it like that here??"" and the answer will be ""Because it's predatory, and Canada is trying to protect you""

It's like when Canadians were complaining about the government infringing on their second amendment rights to bare arms.

That's not a thing in Canada.  There is no ""second amendment"", let alone a right to bare arms and all that.

"In no small part because Elon is an excellent engineer and is usually right (about technical issues especially and about what the company needs to be focused on to succeed), and perfectly capable of recognizing when he’s wrong and changing his mind. He is very clearly not tolerant of people opposing him, especially if they are wrong, so one needs to be very certain of the rightness of one’s opinion before opposing him. 

One area that has gotten many fired is for opposing him on timelines, which any fool can see are impossible or nearly so. There is a real sense that Elon is virtually always wrong about them, but that misses the point entirely of why he does it. 

Elon knows that and doesn’t care, it’s not actually the point to hit them.

To state the obvious to him on an issue like that merely demonstrates that you’re not committed to superhuman effort and thus should seek employment elsewhere.

Say this road has a speed minimum of 45mph meaning you shouldn’t go below that speed. Say this same road now has snow on it and a moose stumbles out onto the highway. Are you still going to go 45+ because a sign told you to? The same logic applies to speed limits.

It really doesn’t, or at least, it shouldn’t if your legislation makes any kind of logical sense.  
I don’t know all American traffic laws, but surely you have a section in there that states that you have to adapt your speed to the circumstances, e.g. weather and traffic, and go slower if needed, which overrides speed minimums. Otherwise, it would also be illegal to be in a traffic jam.

That’s around like what, 260ish? (Cause remember, actual mileage isn’t accurate, it’s only an estimate and we typically just keep our battery on % instead of miles.) so if the bms is likely to assume you added 260 miles, even though, you are not truly gonna get those 260 miles because interstate and whatnot, that’s only about 17-20 ish charger stops that would be waived?

So around what… cost wise… this is like… less than 400-500 value? Am I right? Or am I doing this wrong? 
Just kinda scratching my head on the idea of this because remember, any miles estimate our battery shows is never accurate and spot on due to a multitude of factors. So you won’t truly get those 5000 miles if you ask me, thus I am led to believe the idea of “deal” is monetarily weak compared to someone actually calculating a trade in, and all of the thousands that go into the trade, fees, registration, etc.

Finally, the Tesla required 147 kWh of juice to charge back up to 100% after the test was over.

"That is 100% an acceptable option. It's the issue of muscle memory for me and many people. I have done exactly what you're saying, but there are some issues with this. 

 I have 3 vehicles that i drive. One is an EV.  Getting used to something like 1 pedal driving was easy as it's a regular use case. Reacting to icy conditions is only possible during 3-4 months of the year, and really only a few days/ month of those months that you really need it. It would be useful other times, but not critical.  

When faces with a somewhat uncommon situation, muscle memory kicks in. I've been driving gas cars for almost 20 years. I've been driving EV for a year and a half. My immediate reaction to sliding is release the accelerator, outing the drivetrain into a sort of idle. It gives me a split second to think about my next step. I can then gently apply the friction brakes, accelerate and counter steer, or let the idle slowly slow me down and regain traction.  

That idle is not controlled. It's the default state. It's easy to hold that idle, as I'm providing no input. With Regen, I have to physically hold that idle. A little too much or a not enough pressure on the pedal, and I'm providing a non idle input that can be detrimental to what I want the car to do. Not necessarily catastrophic, but not what i want it to do. 

As i said, it really is all muscle memory, so it can be changed, but most people aren't exclusively driving EV's and have decades+ of driving experiences that they fall back on in an emergency situation without any thought. 

Low Regen is something that is common in the industry (and from my understanding used to be a feature on Tesla's as well), It isn't that hard to implement, and it could be beneficial to many.

"> ICE vehicles also lose range in cold

Cold weather means the air is more dense, the road surface has more friction to overcome (snow/ice to go over/through/slip on), and requires more energy to get everything warm. It affects both ICE and EV's, however nobody stares at their distance to empty and panics if it goes down in an ICE... but the same isn't true for EV's. As they are currently more difficult to locate fast enough charging, there is range anxiety associated with them. That said, as the owner of a 100% EV household. This anxiety went away after owning them and it's gotten better as more charging has become available.

Starting January 1, 2024, dealers must submit information to the IRS through IRS Energy Credits Online to determine vehicle eligibility and amount of a Clean Vehicle Credit at the point of sale.

"As an ev driver living not far from Bemidji, I can confirm that while there is definitely a drop in range, MOST of the time it simply means charging a little longer every night. The few times I've taken longer drives in colder temps (like -20F) I stopped to charge where I wouldn’t have needed to in summer temps, but it isn’t like 'it didn’t work'. In general driving an ev in cold weather is like a cheat code - pre-heat in the garage without needing to open the door, cabin warms super fast because the entire engine block doesn’t need to come up to temp first, it doesn’t sound like it's going to seize when it is starting - they are objectively a better winter car unless your daily drive is more than about 120 miles (and you just can’t be bothered to charge somewhere before you get home). I have a pre-heat pump Tesla btw, so I'd assume newer models would be even better. 

Note I also spent a year in northern Sweden, and can confirm it was a bit warmer there than in central MN - but not by much. 

I can also confirm my previous ICE car got noticeably worse mileage in colder temps - but similarly wasn’t that big a deal; just meant putting gas in a little more frequently.",teslamotors

When the battery is balanced, the battery management system takes reading, ideally across a range of charge percentages.

If the BMS takes readings at varied percentage charge states, it’s supposed to be more accurate.",teslamotors
"Tesla was never losing nearly as much money as Rivian is. I don't think you understand the situation.

If Rivian completely eliminated 100% of their Cap Ex AND R&D spending AND cut 10% of their SGA, they STILL would have lost $2.5b in 2023.

They have about $9b cash on their balance sheet but $5b debt. So really it's more like $4b cash. They burned $6b cash in 2023. They spent around $230k for every vehicle they sold while their R1T/R1S has an ASP of around $90k.

They can't easily raise money because it would either significantly dilute shareholders if they sold stock, and because interest rates are at decade highs. Adding billions in debt at 5-10% annual interest would only make things worse.

They're already taking a liability for the software. if you entrust said liability with Tesla instead of another insurance company. Why do you think they'll stop doing so in the future? Do you expect that FSD will get less safe over time?

Hopefully the new neural net version is much improved.  Even if it is much better, I don't really see the point if it is only level 2 and requires full attention.  The car is amazing and fun to drive.  If I have to pay attention, I don't see value in the feature.

"What a dumb article, likely politically-motivated, by ignorant people.

1. I love how they ignored the upcoming years when Tesla actually started being more profitable. Instead, they selected the years in which Tesla shares skyrocketed but were yet to reach high levels of profitability, thus, they INTENTIONALLY chose a period to make Tesla look bad.
2. These people do not understand how carryover losses work. When a business ramps up, they need to scale. In order to make money, they need to spend money. It'd be stupid to tax a company for losses when they're trying to scale. Otherwise, no one would want to start a business and the economy would slow down. Instead of acknowledging that it is a tax avoidance strategy, they claim these companies are tax dodging. Lol... Do they not know the difference between avoidance and dodging is prison? 
3. Another thing this article fails to mention is that in 2021, Elon paid over $10 billion in taxes. The highest recorded amount by a single taxpayer. But I guess that doesn't fit their narrative.
4. Yes, corporate executives made billions (not in salary) from options. That's what happens when you run a successful business that outperforms the market... These corporate executives were basically paid via performance. That money is taxed. Whether now or in the future when the shares are sold. 
5. They even said Tesla is the worst offender. LMAO, no they aren't. Companies have been using this for a long time, at a much higher degree than Tesla ever did. In the actual article, they even show who the worst offenders are.... and it's not even close.
6. The author is Sarah Fielding. She has a post talking about how she was looking for an accountant for herself. So now this person wants to pretend she's a tax expert? Seriously, if you know NOTHING about taxes, you should probably not talk about taxes. There's a reason people get paid six figures to handle taxes.

You can see this in the service documents released yesterday, where software screenshots are entirely incomplete and unpolished for most guides.

The only thing I'd point out is that vehicle road load is a consumption curve: its the *bare minimum* amount of work that needs to be done due to the vehicle ""Glider"". It does not account for motor, inverter, or battery losses associated with actually driving the vehicle at these speeds. With EVs this doesnt have as big of an impact (since theyre generally in the range of  80-90%) but these consumption numbers based on the coast down don't include them!   


For comparison: Cybertruck AWD vs an F150 SuperCrew 4x4 : not as bad as you'd expect, but the ICE truck is going to need close to 3x as much fuel energy as it actually needs at the wheels :)

"Yes, time or calendar aging is the primary driving factor for most vehicles and lithium battery types. Vehicles are generally are sitting most of the time and when charging, they're charging pretty slowly compared to how they're charged and discharged during cycle performance tests in the lab.

So whether we're talking about LFP, NMC, NCA or whatever, in general, calendar aging appears to be the most significant driver of capacity loss.

And because calendar aging is largely driven by two primary factors - state of charge and temperature, I can't help but cringe when Elon says that LFP batteries can be charged to 100% without harm when NCA batteries can only be charged to 80%, because research studies have shown that charging both chemistries to 100% and letting them sit there is not good for either type of chemistry.

As I said earlier, maybe there's some secret sauce in Tesla's LFP batteries that minimize this, but until shown otherwise, I would be skeptical.

Otherwise, studies have shown that if you want to minimize the rate of calendar aging for NCA batteries, the lower the SOC, the better. For NCA batteries, there's a step change above 55%, so it's best to keep them at 55% and below. For LFP, the step is a bit higher - somewhere above 60-65% (don't recall the exact percentage).

Now when you're cycling batteries, for NCA, you want to keep the cycles shallow - cycling a small amount while keeping the SOC below 55% would be best. For LFP, big cycles don't phase them, so don't worry.

Of course, there are real-life usability issues if you try to follow these guidelines too strictly.

For NCA/NMC batteries, I generally just recommend charging to the lowest SOC that doesn't hinder the usage of the vehicle. And when charging, delay the charge so that it finishes right before you start driving it. And avoid letting the battery sit above 55% SOC for extended periods of time if possible. For example, my regular habit is to charge to 55%, then charge when the SOC gets to 30% or lower or appx below 100 miles of range remaining.

For LFP type batteries, you have to charge to 100% periodically to effectively balance the pack, so if it were me, I would charge to 100%, but only recharge it when it gets down to 50-100 miles of range remaining as well.",teslamotors

For instance, the absolute performance crown goes to the oldest cell format in the Plaid.

This also means it can produce good range from a ~100kw pack.

It seems like 2170 was less capable but cheaper. Which is fine for the products they're designed for. Less pack capacity, smaller vehicle.

"My Tesla has been in for repairs for about 60 days.

I've been in rentals or loaners that are current models from VW, Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai and Kia.

All of them have ""lane keep"" systems that much much much more frequently do things like ""dive for the shoulder"" or just simply shut off in the middle of a curve and the wheel jerks to straight while the car makes a little ""beep boop"" sound.

Tesla's is by far better than any of the brands above in terms of holding a lane and not suddenly diving for shoulders or yanking the wheel toward turn lanes or just simply going ""beep boop"" and driving straight toward a guard rail.

It was a little surprising to me how bad they all are.

The Toyota I had... I was driving across Wyoming and turned on the lane centering for a bit.  Just TACC/Lane (kinda like AUtopilot).  About 20 minutes in, the road has some old markings that looked like 6 months ago they'd diverged for bridge work.

The lane keep violently (like squealing tires) turned toward the guard rail.  I had a full fish-tail at freeway speed to keep it on the road.  Fortunately it was dry pavement.

The Kia I had would do fine for about 4 minutes (it also wouldn't warn me to keep my hands on the wheel for a minute or more at a time if I let go).  But if I kept my hand on the wheel to provide ""weight"" to keep it from warning, after about 4 minutes, it would start oscillating and 'bouncing' off the edges of the lane.  This would always get worse and worse until it just went ""beep boop"" and dove for the guardrail.  That was wild.

The VW was probably the best of them. It was fairly confident, but if I clicked the turn signal (which should do a lane change), it would say ""initiating lane change"" on the dash and turn the car like it was changing lanes.

But all 4 times I tried it, it went ""beep boop"" and the dash said ""lane change failed"" and the car would just continue driving at a 5 degree angle to the lanes across traffic, unless I snatched the wheel and yanked it back onto the right track.  That was kind of wild.

My experience with Tesla, is at least when it fails, it fails fairly loudly and lets you know it's failing.

No ""beep boop"" and then just drive at the median.",teslamotors

Just because a road has a speed limit doesn’t mean driving at that speed is safer. In fact driving on roads where the majority of people are going 10-15mph over the speed limit and you go exactly the speed limit increases your chances of getting in an accident. Every time you pass someone or someone passes you the probability an accident increases. Cars pacing each other instead of passing greatly reduces the chances of 2 cars getting into a collision.,teslamotors

"Reading the IIHS post, I'm actually encouraged.  They are pushing for some sort of consistency which is great.

A good example of the IIHS having a view that differs from Tesla, but I think is better under their section ""Driver Involvement"".  They say that a driver should be able to make in lane adjustments without it causing disengagement.

That would be a wonderful refinement to AP on multi-lane highways and even on trunk roads.  It would allow a driver to nudge the car in lane to give more space past a vehicle in a lay-by, or a pedestrian near the road edge or... to dodge damned potholes. 

It would also mean that Tesla has to be smarter about who has control.  At the moment it's binary. If it thinks you took control back by making a steering input it abdicates any input.  This can mean that a bump on a bend can mean that it thinks you made enough steering input to override even though you didn't do anything sufficient to leave the lane.

On the flip side of this binary is that if you want to make a small steering adjustment, such as to dodge a pothole, then you either have to use the stalk to cancel AP (good luck for those with no stalks) or exert a decent level of force to take control, which could then mean that you over steer vs the adjustment you wanted to make.

A fuzzy rather than binary view of who is in control would be way better - with the AP saying I'll gently keep you in lane, and I'll be more forceful if you stray out of lane.

This would also help the nag on some of the UK's single track roads where the lane departure system goes bananas when you want to squeeze to one side to pass an oncoming vehicle.",teslamotors

Also; most of those gas station ones work best being on the side of the car, not the front (like not really designed to extend the length of the car, just half the length). 

That model is doable, but is more conducive to the gas station style with a line of chargers and cars parallel parking into the spots, which is less conducive to situations with cars there for more than a few minutes. 

Totally doable model, but it’s a bit of a deviation from the dense parking setup that the teslas currently set up. Gas stations serve far fewer cars per square foot than Tesla chargers do — and they’d definitely do the dense Tesla setup if it were just a simple matter of different cable setups.",teslamotors

"A pretty timely video from today's Car Edge: https://www.youtube.com/live/EUR7t4PKMwg?si=LCdakzuN1g_UF9_7

Yes, purely coincidence. Ford is having troubles. They mention in this video that they are waiting on a headlight replacement for the 2024 Lightnings. It is surprising because they are more apt to send them out and wait for the recall, as evidenced (pointed out in the video) by their industry leading number of physical recalls this year. As Ray mentions in the video ""Quality is Job None"" with Ford. 

They also happen to be hosting one of the channels I follow (Car Questions Answered). While they do kind of crap on EVs in general sometimes (like early in the video they reference their mistake with the Lightning is not having a gas engine in it), it does give interesting insight into the overall market.

Edit to add: The F150's have been sitting on dealer lots well before they even announced deliveries to begin for Cybertruck. One of the good things about the Car Edge is it tracks days on lots for the area and they were surprised that even 10 had sold in the last 45 days.",teslamotors

eventually someone figured out _if they can get new lane markers painted on the road..._ - and called the authorities (DMV?) and happened to get someone who was a huge fan of Musk and Tesla - and he basically did them a favour and arranged for new lines to be painted on the road...

Many make it over 200k miles with no issues, and if you are patient and do the same, your “battery fund” could easily help you purchase another used but newer Tesla a few years down the road and repeat the process.

Imagine right now there's a GPS spot where the humans keep having to intervene.  Enough interventions happen, Tesla notices and starts looking into it.  Pretty standard today.

But in v11 they'd have to watch a bunch of clips, figure out what the car did wrong, then figure out ways to code for that edge case - but also make sure that new code didn't create different behaviors elsewhere.  And clearly, it wasn't working anymore.

Now, if they just find a spot where humans need to intervene a lot ... they just go collect a bunch of high safety-score drives by humans that have driven through the same spot in different conditions (clear/rain, day/night), and stuff dozens or hundreds them into the clip library and call it done.  Ideally, the car will have somehow magically learned how to deal with it on the next release.

"I'll try and give a better answer than the others.  When you hit the windscreen the glass does shatter, there's just a sheet of plastic laminated between the layers of glass that can stretch and deform.  This is a violent stop but it's slightly better than hitting a solid wall.  It's also a big surface so the force is spread across your body as different parts impact.

In the being ejected scenario you still hit the windscreen except this time it's rigid and shatters.  Glass shatters at an incredibly fast speed, much faster than you would be hitting it, so as soon as enough energy has been transferred from you to the glass it breaks.  That's not an inconsequential amount of energy.

You then pass through that shattered glass, which is likely countless small cubes due to the way its made, collecting some of it with you.  What happens next depends on what you hit, if you landed in a big foam pit then you may not sustain any more damage.  But chances are slim and the more likely scenario is that your car hit something strong and solid and your body is about to hit the same thing. If that's something like a solid block of concrete then that's a big solid thing to hit, made worse by the small chunks of glass you're now covered in.  If it's something like a strong metal pole then you too could be about to hit that pole, giving a localised impact and turning a good chunk of your momentum into torque.  You'll spin off into the next hard thing.

The total energy of the impact is roughly the same, which is why you should wear your seatbelt - when you're ejected you do add the additional potential energy of the height of your fall, where if you hit the glass and drop then the distance to the dashboard isn't as great.  But the outcome very much comes down to what else you hit.  The windscreen is a large object spreading the force across your body with at least a little give, where if you're ejected you get one big impact like that but then it's down to what else you hit.  And potentially what hits you if you're left vulnerable on the carriageway.",teslamotors

"Even if your narrative was accurate, the point is that Tesla said Model 3 would be delivered in 2017 while explaining all the nuances around “production hell” for why they might miss. But they delivered Model 3 in 2017. While it wasn’t delivered at volume, people understood and they were forgiving because no one was lying to them. Then volume came in 2018 and all was good.

That’s not what happened with the Roadster. Roadster is projected to be 5 years late from a release date committed to 8 years ago. That’s a problem, and it was a lie, because your narrative is missing the part where Elon was baking in a stacked set of assumptions about battery manufacturing technology breakthroughs that didn’t pan out for 4680 (yet) which is why both the Roadster and Semi are so late. Here’s the point: Elon could’ve been as upfront about Roadster’s development as he was about Model 3, but he wasn’t.

"This is not correct - the 'difficult' constraint for putting down power when a car is traction limited absolutely is downforce, then the downstream effect is you need tires that can withstand the strain. 

Downforce massively improves acceleration, braking, and cornering - you could argue how significant the portion is that is cornering, but it improves all 3. It's most obvious effects are braking and cornering, simply because it squares with velocity, and traction limited acceleration is usually at lower speed. This problem doesn't exist with fan cars. 

For example, current f1 cars accelerate faster from 100-200 kph than 0-100, because they have 1000hp, low weight, and very little downforce below 100kph. If you took a modern F1 car and redesigned it to be a fan car - say taking the downforce number from 200kph, and applying that constantly at all speeds, the 0-100kph time would be massively, massively improved, perhaps by 50%

Designing road tires to deal with actual (ballpark, the weight of the actual car) downforce is certainly very tricky, but its the only solution as long as you're traction limited.",teslamotors

I have my qualms though. 


It goes 80% throttle from the line when the light turns green. I thought it was too slow before. It’s too fast now lol. 


Taking away TACC is dumb. I rely on TACC because single-lane Autopilot no longer exists with FSD on. On my 25mi commute, the car turns on the blinker to try to move into a lane that doesn’t exist (it won’t actually execute it, it’ll just keep the blinker on for two mi) and moves out of the carpool lane despite not needing to for another 10mi. TACC works as a fallback in those situations.

Even factoring the $7.5k tax credit into my car, that means my net cost of the car is $42k. $32k private value (being generous here) / $42k net cost = 24% depreciation in one year. 

So yes, the article is pretty spot on. This is my first EV and first non-Toyota product. My 2017 Corolla with 80k miles has depreciated much less than my Model 3.

"Just tried out v12.2.1 last night after the update!  Overall, I think it's much more competent and promising with the way it drives.  Parking lots, slowing down for potholes, making smoother than butter maneuvers - it's all very impressive and promising!!!  Between the two disengangements below, it felt so confident and human that I'd prefer its driving to most Ubers haha.

The few regressions for the record, which were surprisingly bad and required intervention (but I'm assuming it'll get better): it tried turning the wrong way (left) onto a divided road 😬.  Also, when it needed to make a right turn but there were cones blocking the rightmost lane, it seemed to just ignore the existence of said cones.  Aside from the disengangements, which I'm fully confident wouldn't have happened on v11, maybe since it's the first v12 public build, it drives almost infuriatingly slowly at times - through roundabouts, mountain roads, etc.  Not bad, but feels like a new driver.

Overall, very impressive.  The system has gone from feeling like clearly a robot to an attentive but new and cautious and prone to some silly mistakes 16 year old driver.  This gives me more hope for true FSD though, since the basics are so much better!!!",teslamotors
"They still have a weird override in FSD that will reject a visual speed limit update from a sign on certain road types (like a two lane highway) if it disagrees with the shitty map speed limit data by more than a certain amount or maybe it’s if it’s close enough to a point where the highway passes through a city. Not sure. Either way, it’s incredibly annoying because it will hide the sign on the visualization and continue driving at the minimum speed legally allowed without user override. It will then proceed to show other speed limit signs on the same highway on the visualization and correct its speed limit accordingly.

This has been an issue since pretty much when they first introduced vision based speed limit sign detection. They really need to fix this. I’m sure it’s a liability thing, possibly to combat the potential for people to just put up fake speed limit signs to mess with them, but FSD cannot be driving people around 30 mph below the speed limit. That’s dangerous and ridiculous. 

They could at least be flagging the deviations from map data on visually recognized speed limit signs and elevating them for correction if enough flags happen in the same geotagged area. A human contractor could approve thousands of automatically flagged and tagged scenarios like this a day. They either need to have the confidence to use the inputs they’re getting from vision, or come up with ways to fix the damn map data. The rest of FSD is good enough that this is now a significant remaining issue.",teslamotors

I never use it because I find it very non-intuitive. Same with saying that the visualization provides blind spot coverage (as a defence for why the side mirrors don't have an indicator light like virtually every other manufacturer).

I think this is because I've been doing the ""shoulder check"" my entire driving life and overcoming that habit is very difficult. But also because I don't think looking toward the centre of the vehicle is intuitive or natural. I find it's much more natural to turn my head and check over my left shoulder to see if there's a vehicle there then turn my head to the right and check the screen. Not to mention my right hand blocks a portion of the screen anyway.

I'm not saying remove the blind spot camera feature. It's obviously popular with a lot of drivers and I think it's a good option. I just don't think I'll ever find myself using it.",teslamotors

High end is questionable. I'd call them expensive rather than high end. 

>Half used Teslas lost half their value in the past two years? Of course not. This chart is useless unless until it is adjusted to model, milage, and age.

Except it has? Model Y 2021-2022 models go for $20k-$35k, we need to compare that to MSRP as well, not adjusted for tax credits or incentives. A quick search for me shows a used 2022 long range model for $30k, MSRP for that is $48k.

> was selling a product for $10k and then introduced a very popular product for $100k, it would be very misleading to show that the used market for my products jumped to 70k because both products are included in the numbers.

Except model Ys were expensive during the pandemic? Used models were going for the 50s and even 60s. With brand new ones starting in the high 50s. 

That spike wouldn't be attributed to a brand new product, the used number of units on that new item would be tiny so it wouldn't cause such a spike. The spike was because of the short supply or model Ys at the time. Causing their value to go up to meet the crazy demand at the time.",teslamotors

"I agree with some of this, at least as far as their approach to designing a product, but if you take USS and parking assist as a single example, they need to remember that millions of customers are part of this experiment and their decisions might cause somebody to damage their car or people. That’s not going to lead to happy customers and repeat purchases.

They removed USS at the end of 2022 with no warning and they finally delivered a version of Tesla vision which sort of works Xmas 23 so that’s not 5 months. I don’t count the one with the squiggly orange lines because that just looked broken and was almost totally useless. 

The need to reinvent EVERYTHING also smacks of hubris. They can certainly approach the design from scratch, but if what they release is much worse than their competitors it puts them at a disadvantage. 

The current park assist doesn’t look cutting edge to the casual observer. I know it’s amazing that they are reading in 2D images and generating gray 3D car blobs out of them and road markings (if they are contrasty enough) but it doesn’t always activate when driving into a parking space and objects jump around and disappear, so I wouldn’t depend on it. It might add what you propose but I would have thought they’d have done it already if they could with the resources at their disposal.

Look at what Porsche, Audi and Mercedes are doing now to see a very good 360 camera system which has a detailed 3D model of a car you can spin around by touch, augmented by audible and visual cues from plentiful USS and also enable the car to park itself while in and outside the vehicle quickly.

Premium Connectivity adds a number of features to your car, like life traffic visualization, satellite-view maps, music and video streaming, and much more.

Tesla still wanted to give new owners the opportunity to try the feature to entice them to subscribe, so they included a 1 year free trial with all new purchases. Again, as the popularity of the Model 3 and Model Y grew exponentially, Tesla limited the trial to 30 days for the two EVs, while keeping the 1 year trial for new Model S/X owners.

Now the company is again giving all new owners a 1 year Premium Connectivity subscription, but this time you have to use a referral code.

According to an update to the mobile app on Wednesday night, new buyers and loyalty buyers (those who already own a Tesla and are buying another) will get the 1 year subscription, along with the three-month trial of Full Self-Driving (FSD).

The funny thing is moving to texas does not legalize what he did at all.  It just increases the chance they can judge shop for cases and look for an irrational conservative nut job.  That also won't really work because the person suing tesla gets to file the case.

Also, there is no possible way they can even move the incorporation from delaware to texas while any legal issues are going on.

This is not an argument. I find people fixating on this are completely wrong on everything.  You only need 1 share to have standing.

"I just got my car back from being repaired on Wednesday from some ass hat backing into it while I was parked in a parking lot.  Got FSD 12 while it was at the body shop for three weeks, and got to use it on the way back.  Pretty decent, but had a weird habit of going fairly slowly.  It also didn't slow down for people slowly cutting into my lane in bumper to bumper freeway traffic until fairly late (no threat of collision, and would be how I would probably do it to make sure no one else tries to cut in too, but slightly uncomfortable for me when the car was doing it and had me ready to hit the brake if necessary)  And it refused to go at a stop sign at an unprotected left for whatever reason and just stayed there until I pushed it through with the go pedal (no cars around so I let it sit for a bit).

Just got the 12.3 update last night and used it today.  Major improvement over the one drive I had with v12, albeit just in my local suburb since I didn't need to go into the city.  No random slowdowns, and instead of sitting at the same stop sign with an unprotected left, it went by itself.  Also impressed me by doing a fairly tight U-turn, which versions previous to 12 wouldn't do at all.  Overall, v12 100 percent handles stop signs better than previous versions; I don't feel the need to hit the go pedal every time since it's taking too long, at least not so far.

- removal of USS before having a viable alternative, pretending is a feature to have an error range of like 2 feet on a parking sensor because ""wow, vision"". Addition of bumper cams is an acknowledgement they screwed everyone over.
- frequent and drastic MSRP price cuts instead of rebates, making Tesla notorious for extremely high vehicle depreciation, to the point where the fleets have stopped buying them
- removal of stalks, touch screen drive control (not just because of the recent death - I have it and while it works, it is worse.. which is kind of Tesla's new trend)
- cutting features not just on 3/Y but also on their luxury S/X.
- refusal to implement better driver monitoring. Everyone hates the wheel nag. It's annoying to drivers and not a good measure of attentiveness. Cabin camera is only marginally supportive to safety, but doesn't help with how annoying it is.
- focus on FSD instead of much lower hanging fruit. My last Tesla could autopark and summon (albeit both terribly). My new one can't, and there's really no plans to add them back until FSD is ""finished"", afaik.
- lack of features that are pretty standard for other vehicles at a comparable price point. My friend's 2017 bolt has a 360 degree parking camera! Even when Tesla did have things like autopark, they were literally the worst in the industry.

If a company started like Tesla behaves in today's environment, they would be absolutely crushed. Tesla created a HUGE market advantage and they have been squandering it for years with a lack of innovation and bonehead moves. It's kinda like they just stopped running in the race to goad their competition to pass them up. At this rate, it seems like their long term success will be the supercharger network.

Maybe municipal energy storage, but I'd rather my grid use those giant weights instead... Seems a lot more sustainable to just lift and drop giant heavy stones.

The competition is catching up, and when they do, customers won't have to tolerate any of Tesla's wonky behavior.",teslamotors

">Oh they present shit anecdotal evidence. Great. Very professional.

That they provide an anecdote doesn't mean there's no evidence, and frankly, given the lack of transparency from Tesla on AP safety, I tend to agree.

AP (I've had Model 3 and now Model Y) is great in so many ways and definitely makes driving long journeys easier, but I also see many situations where despite being very aware of the technology, dangerous situations can occur because of how the AP system interacts with the driver.

A good example was when on a software update our car started reading the speed limit signs for lorries and limiting the set AP speed based on that. I could override that by using the accelerator.  Now I'm in the situation where the car will not brake automatically or slow automatically if we're nearing another vehicle, or one cuts in.

That would be fine if auto-steer wasn't engaged, as I'd have the tactile feedback that I'm in control, but with my foot at a fixed position on the accelerator, it's easy to by tricked based on the 2 previous years of AP usage.

That's an anecdote too, but as far as evidence goes, we so far do not have concrete evidence that Tesla's AP safety stats are not comparing apples and oranges.  Comparing expensive luxury sedans against the whole vehicle fleet is not a fair comparison.

Nor is comparing when someone has AP engaged (or even can engage it) compared to when it isn't, simply because that would then be based on road type.

A good figure which Tesla will have would be to compare when people are on the same highway in the same level of traffic, in the same weather conditions.  They'll have that just from California alone.",teslamotors

"> Thoughts? 

Growth companies in general are getting a lot of scrutiny in a growth-constrained economy. Look at what’s happening with tech stocks- they can post Revenue and EPS beats, and the price still tanks because investors expected even more growth. 

Imo Tesla and BYD are now bumping up against a soft-ceiling on growth: new customers will be exponentially more difficult to acquire than the existing ones; for example, at this point, almost everyone who wants an EV SUV either has one or just cant afford one. So Tesla has a lot riding on the Cybertruck and the Model 2, the two most popular vehicle-classes currently missing (or rather, not sold in big numbers yet re Cybertruck) from their offerings (Pickup and Small Economy ).

I’m honestly not sure how well the Cybertruck will do, but I will say this- people on the internet vastly overestimate how “practical” American truck-buyers actually want their trucks to be. ~75% of truck-owners report using the bed once per year or less.

More test is needed, but I’m actually impressed by FSD for the first time in a while. The last time I was even surprised at all was when it was able to make a full 90° turn for the first time. Ever since that major jump, everything had been two steps forward, two steps back… until now.

"I bought the FSD upgrade for $2k when it had the ""fire sale"" in late 2019 IIRC.  The ""FSD computer"" HW upgrade followed, over a year or so later, and it was indeed free.

To clarify - my 2018 S was a demo car, I bought it just before the Raven models came out, it was a ""demo car"" with 50 miles on it and a bunch of price adjustments, which I picked up on the last day of 2018.  It came with Enhanced Auto Pilot.  Some time in 2019 they kept having sales on FSD, I think it was $6k at the time, and it dropped to $2-4k for a few days or a week -- I know I ended up pulling the trigger it for $2k and I was hesitant even at that price, mainly did it because I knew it'd mean I'd get the upgraded HW version.  

In hindsight, at $2k it was probably a fair-value (at least for me/my 'driving profile').  I don't think I'd feel like I got a fair amount of value if I'd have paid more for it;  I'd probably be actively upset if I had paid >$4k for it, at least as of now (especially with the vehicle's age & being out of warranty).

Edited to add -- Happy to check the app or run out to the vehicle & check the relevant UIs, if there's a clear/easy way to tell.   If it'll help someone potentially confirm their HW upgrade eligibility, I'm more than happy to do so!  :)",teslamotors

I remember someone pointing out that how fast cars can brake 60-0 is a good indication of how fast they can possibly go 0-60.  In other words you can put really big good brakes with anti-lock tech on a car and decelerate it from 60-0 using tires and actually pushing the same amount of energy out thru the tires to accelerate it has a symmetry from a physics perspective.  With the caveat that drag racers sometimes use actually parachutes to decelerate and Tesla talks about using jet/rockets on the Roadster which might break some of the braking rules.  I'm trying to figure out how jet/rockets on a street legal car.  Is it ok to melt the front grill of the car behind me?  :-),teslamotors

Everyone is hyping it up- golly gee.,But the range is SHIT for a vehicle that runs around $150,000!with taxes.If you are really going to travel in it, dump baggage or I do not know what in the back then your range is going to SHRINK. If you tow- even more! Then to get to the 400 plus range you have to order an extension battery that will take up 1/3 of the bed after being installed by Tesla for $15,000 extra or for me with 3 trucks that I ordered- $45,000 more. But wait fans there is more- the battery is not available until a year from now- YOU HOPE!!!!!!! 

So, you buy or lease FSD, except it's not FSD. You buy or lease a decked out Cybertruck that at best can't go any farther for its overwhelming cost than a Y or 3. (Remember Musk bullshitted that it would have a 500 mile range?) And you can pray to get a range extender battery that swallows up a third of the damn truck bed for $15,000 grand more in year- maybe, possibly, quien sabe.

More than likely the people pushing the new Cybertruck are schmucks OR now that they own one they don't want to say they should never have bought one because it will lower the resale value of the car OR somehow they get something under the table for promoting the vehicle. Oh yeah, there is a cadre of folks who love to be first with anything and they are show offs and they will only say great things about the Cybertruck.

See: [https://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads/World-Ranking-of-Manufacturers-1.pdf](https://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads/World-Ranking-of-Manufacturers-1.pdf)

Rivian is neither. And i suspect alot of the smaller China car companies are only surviving thanks to the generous help of the CCP and/or due to lax local/regional regulations surrounding car safety standards for example. Those same companies likely couldn't survive in the West.

So i wonder why that is...

If you read Rivian's latest SEC filing following the reveal of the R2/R3 here: [https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1765831156195537310](https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1765831156195537310) you'll find something very interesting.

It would appear that Rivian plans to have in 2026, when the R2 launches, a maximum production capacity at their Normal, IL factory of 205,000 vehicles across ALL platforms.

Last quarter Rivian produced 57,000 vehicles.

So either there's a mistake in there or Rivian basically plans to convert some existing assembly lines (R1S/R1T/Van) to R2 assembly lines. And it looks like they don't plan on growing volumes at all until then. Which leads me to wonder if demand for the R1S/R1T is less than expected, or if there's no demand for their Electric Delivery Van after they fulfill Amazon's order? Either way it's not a good look. It also makes me wonder when will they grow production? Do they have the room to increase produciton at the IL factory, or can they literally not increase production without bulding another factory... which they can't do because they don't have enough money.",teslamotors

"> To claim that ""neural nets have been around for sooooo long!""

When did I say anything about neural nets? BTW, I design neural nets for a living, so I'm pretty familiar with their applications.

> We went from teaching a computer to play breakout solely off of visual inputs

That was a demo for RL systems. In terms of autonomous driving, we've had systems far more reliable than FSD since about 2010.

> of neural-network based systems

Again, when did I say anything about neural nets? You seem to be overestimating the importance of one single algorithm. When you say ""neural-network based systems"" what does that mean? We had systems to autonomous driving with neural nets for perception in 2012, and planning in 2014 (both of which, again, far outperformed anything Tesla currently has). But what type of neural nets qualifies a system as ""neural net based""? Realistically, all neural nets are a combination of trainable weights and statistical decision making.

* $2.5k inventory discount
* 5k free supercharger miles, with maybe $700 to me. I'm not doing a trade in as Tesla valuation is low.

The demon has the same horsepower as the S plaid, yet it can do 0-60 in 1.7 seconds versus the 2 second (faked) time of the S.

That shows that the issue is grip and not power.

If they fit drag tyres on a perfectly prepped track then they can probably beat the 1.7 second demon, but they aren't honestly beating 1 second even if they add a fourth motor to get the current plaid powertrain up to something like 1,400bhp. Even at 2,000bhp they aren't doing it.

"My hunch is that the battery platform and performance specs keep iterating and that delays new products.

Elon has *always* been unreasonably optimistic about everything and it’s not just PR and hype marketing.

You don’t start a rocket company and a car company, much less at the same time, if you have a sane level of natural optimism.

The delay of the Semi, CyberTruck and Roadster are because the production rate AND energy profile of the 4680 cells are taking years to iron out.

A huge hint is how much lower the CyberTruck range ended up being. Because the Roadster is a performance vehicle they need years more of fine tuning the 4680 production process to get closer to the original specs.

At least that’s my guess. 

Even small changes in the battery pack and it’s size, weight and weight distribution will have a profound impact on a supercars feel and performance.

The 4680 production processes keep improving and inching the energy density and performance closer to the original specs. 

You can hide this in tanks like the semi, CT and Y but for a performance supercar you have tight margins and can’t just use software limits to hide that the batteries are improving over time.

TL;DR There won’t be a Roadster until the 4680 production process is perfected and every vehicle launch delay has been due to Elon’s typical radical optimism in the timeline of producing a revolutionary product (a tabless, dry cathode battery).",teslamotors

- If there is ample spare capacity elsewhere, the cabinet can receive up to 575kW from other cabinets or a battery; that means four cars can come close to 250kW, but not quite reach it.

Most of the time, cars aren't taking maximum power and a lightly loaded SC location will be able to pass power back and forth to meet demand no matter how the cars are distributed.

It’s not the non-Tesla fault, and some Tesla owners bought into the exclusivity of the supercharging network.

"The biggest challenge with replacing something like CAN with Ethernet is the switching piece. With CAN, every message goes to everyone on the bus. They either get the message or miss the message. So this would be the equivalent of like a UDP broadcast packet, except the most common approaches to Ethernet involve store and forward switching in the middle. So timing becomes an issue, e.g. does the latency introduced by the switch stay constant, or does it fluctuate? The switch itself can drop packets as well. Lastly, there are almost always multiple independent CAN buses inside a vehicle. You ideally wouldn’t do this for Ethernet. But this introduces other issues, like whether every device can handle sifting through large volumes of traffic. Yes, routing and VLANs and IGMP multicasting can be brought in, but this all introduces latency.

This is obviously all solvable, since Tesla solved it. But it doesn’t take much research at all to understand why it’s so complicated to pull it off well",teslamotors

Haptic feedback is nice for knowing if an interaction has registered, but without also making it some sort of distinct shape recognizable by touch, it's solving the least-important half of the issue.

So the typical rule of not a car being the best value when it’s 2-3 years old doesn’t actually hold up for totally new models (ie, the Cybertruck right now.)

You may have missed it but Tesla also makes a truck and a semi-trailer.

Something which is sorely needed as emissions from this class of vehicle has risen significantly in the past few decades.

>He's interested in the future of transportation being his cars that make him money

Haha, how do you come to that? Seriously, can you take me through your thinking? 

It is 2004, you are Elon Musk. You've got about $100 million. In your world he just wants to make money and doesn't care about EVs. So, how do you maximize return?

Of all the options you've got open to you. Of all the highly profitable businesses and industries you could get involved with, what's your best bet for making money? 

You think putting millions into starting an EV company with every chance of failing is the best play?

You know everybody thinks it will fail. Everybody is against you. The entire fossil fuel industry wants you dead. You know the chance of going bankrupt is very high and you're most likely going to lose the $6.5 million you put in anything else long the way.

2. No tilt function on right wheel. I hate having to go through menus to set FSD to chill in traffic. Probably disabled because it'd be too easy to accidentally disable FSD.

Definitely agree. I drive in the city at night and the glass on the Tesla windshield is wayy better at stopping light from reflecting or spreading, compared to other cars we’ve had. My wife isn’t a huge fan of the no-buttons interior but she prefers driving the Tesla at night because she can see so much better (she has a Mustang). 

There’s a mall in our city that has a restaurant we love, but we absolutely loathed going there because at night it’s bumper-to-bumper traffic trying to exit, all the lane markings have faded and some don’t go where you think they’re gonna go because you have to circle the whole lot and some lanes just end but nobody wants to let you back over, and there’s street-lights on full-blast on top of everyone’s rear-lights being on, it’s just really stressful to navigate unless you’ve done it a lot.

There's a reason Plaid has more than twice the power of M3P without cutting 0-60 in half. 

And to release that much power quickly from the battery pack, while maintaining battery health - you need more capacity. As you increase capacity... you simply re-engineered a Model S, not a Model 3.

[By this article](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/potsdam/brandenburg/wasserverbands-prasident-tritt-zuruck-kein-abwasserstopp-fur-brandenburgs-tesla-fabrik-11297611.html), Tesla exceeded contractual levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater sent to the WSE but there were no issues with WSE wastewater levels at the sewage treatment plant nor any environmental hazard to the water supply

>\[google translated\] ""The WSE management had justified the planned Tesla disposal stop with the fact that the factory has been exceeding the discharge parameters for nitrogen and phosphorus agreed with the WSE for some time, which is indeed the case. However, these are not chemical residues from production, but common components of sanitary wastewater from toilets and kitchens, which now largely make up the wastewater from the Tesla factory. At the Münchehof sewage treatment plant in Berlin, where all of the association's wastewater is disposed of, there have been no exceedances of limit values in WSE wastewater so far - and thus no environmental hazard for the Müggelsee or even Berlin's drinking water supply, for example.

"Your comments are bordering on absurd and reek of someone with little to no experience with the system.

FSD in its current form is “real to some extent” as the other commenter said. It functions nearly entirely autonomously for me and many others every single day. To say that it’s “dangerous as hell to everyone on the road” is a ludicrous statement to make and clearly shows you are just touting something you’ve heard. The system is genuinely already safer than many, if not most drivers in most situations. It might not always be perfectly comfortable but it’s certainly far from dangerous. Sure, it makes mistakes, but might I point you to the over 2 million car accidents per year in the US alone? Even on a proportionate basis, it’s not even close to that. 

You go on about how it’s “only level 2” and “only Honda and Mercedes have level 3” and that might be true… but do yourself a favour and check out the laundry list of exceptions when Mercedes “level 3” system will not work. I’ll take a “level 2” system that functions 99.9% of the time versus the “level 3” system that I have to constantly worry about whether it’s working or not or if I can engage it. That is substantially more dangerous. The distinction between levels 2 and 3+ are largely about liability anyway so your point is mainly moot. Tesla could easily say tomorrow that FSD is level 3 or even higher but that would require them to state that you are not driving which raises hosts of potential legal issues.

All this to say, you gotta relax. You’re going hard on something for no discernible reason while being confidently incorrect most of the time.

It was a 2020 Model X, which either had regular automotive glass windows or double pane acoustic glass, both of which are bog standard in the auto industry. Car glass is hard to break without a specialized hammer in general, and this can be even tougher when submerged. 

>She couldn’t open the doors?

Water pressure, even slight pressure, would prevent most anybody from opening a car door until the vehicle is completely submerged and the pressure equalizes. This was tested on MythBusters. For the record, a 2020 Model X has mechanical door handles.

"Nope. As I said there are very obvious and common cases where optical cameras fail. Humans have ways to deal with these situations that FSD does not. Tesla has no way to prove to regulators that the system can operate safely on its own in those instances. Hence why it will never be approved for fully autonomous operation without a safety driver. There are a variety of other reasons FSD will never be L5 as well. For example, they don’t have fully redundant hardware required for a “fail operational” safety critical system. They don’t have fully redundant steering, braking, power or sensors. 

Unfortunately, you and many investors been duped by Elon. Elon’s goal is to sell more cars and make more money so his priority is bringing down COGS and convincing people to pay 12k for a L2 driver assistance package. Hence why he keeps removing parts and doesn’t have the basic hardware necessary for an L5 system. But you’ve obviously eaten it up. 

There’s a reason Tesla doesn’t have a permit to test even a single vehicle without a safety driver yet.

I am not sure if that is what was said. Tesla was supposed to be so far ahead on EVs not so much with batteries. They just bought the cells from someone else, their battery management was reputed to be better than other manufacturers, which is still correct (just look at their reliability and lack of degradation). But the massive leap the Chinese manufacturers have made in just the last 2-3 years in battery manufacture has left everyone (including Tesla) in the dust. It really is astounding what they have done (and will do in the next few years). If BYD and CATL had not have changed the game Tesla would STILL be so far ahead, but instead they are just ahead of the old school manufacturers, and BEHIND CATL and BYD.",teslamotors

"Falcon 9's cold gas thrusters output about 400N of thrust.

That would add probably enough weight to be more of a burden than a help.

It would tighten the product alignment while also giving them something legitimate they can put on X without making people's eyes roll with another ""V12.4 will be literal Jesus!"" post.

1. Push out the 11.x FSD build to every car with basic autopilot on up. Software limit it so that it only does what autopilot is supposed to do, but we all agree that it's worlds better on the highway. It would be an instant reputation boost for FSD. This is necessary for the next steps.

2. Move the driver monitoring to be completely camera-based when on the highway. That way they can advertise hands-free on the highway, just like SuperCruise and BlueCruise. The existing software could probably do it with few modifications. Now you get to make press releases and advertise the feature as being hands-free, which would kick the stock up.

3. Re-align the Autopilot/Enhanced AP/FSD with competitor's feature sets so that comparison shopping and amateur testing is easier. Enhanced AP should be equal to or better than anything the competition has and FSD should always be above and beyond. Frankly, I'd rename the steps at the same time in order to differentiate. Perhaps: Autopilot, Autopilot+ and Autopilot Pro?

4. Make (internally) a hard date for when you're pushing v12 to the entire FSD fleet and keep it. I recommend about 3 days before an earnings call.

5. Make a plan for a Model X replacement. The CT ramp is going to keep happening. The Y will get the Highland treatment sooner or later, but I understand why they can't announce that fact. The $25k econobox car is happening, but I do not recommend they go that far down-market. They need something to fight the Kia EV9, EQS SUV and upcoming Lucid Gravity.",teslamotors

"r/ConfidentlyWrong 

Here's gemini explanation  


**The Theoretical Picture** 

* **Work-Energy Principle:** This fundamental principle states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. Since the final kinetic energy required to reach 60 mph is the same regardless of acceleration time, the total work *theoretically* remains the same.
* **Ignoring Losses** By assuming no friction or heat loss, this ideal scenario would suggest that the net energy used is identical, regardless of whether you accelerate quickly or slowly.

**Why Reality is Different:**

* **Power's Role:**
   * Power dictates *how fast* you can deliver the energy needed for acceleration. Think of it like filling a bucket with water:
      * Low power = slowly trickling water from a faucet
      * High power = blasting water from a firehose
   * Faster acceleration (the firehose) requires delivering a lot of energy in a short time. This equates to high power, even if the bucket (total kinetic energy) fills to the same level.
* **Inefficiency:**
   * Engines and electric motors are not 100% efficient. Energy conversion always leads to some heat loss.
   * Faster acceleration worsens efficiency. Heat losses increase significantly because:
      * Internal friction in the engine/motor increases at higher speeds.
      * Air resistance rises dramatically with speed (it's related to the *cube* of your speed!)
* **The Battery Perspective (for EVs):**
   * Batteries have limits on how quickly they can release energy (power output). Trying to accelerate very fast can strain the battery, reducing efficiency and causing heat buildup.
   * This heat buildup further hampers range by making other electrical systems in the car work harder (like cooling systems).

**In Summary**

While the total energy required to *reach* 60mph might theoretically be similar, the factors of power and real-world inefficiency mean you lose much more energy achieving that speed quickly. This translates directly to decreased range.",teslamotors

The wired charging doesn't lose much and this system has EXACTLY as much wiring, but adds an additional inductance/resonant charging pad losses.

I have to guess they mean that their system can be 85-90% efficient and then you have the other car losses, so a total of like 70%, which is still pretty good.

I'm skeptical until I see a third party test, since that's better than any other wireless charging I've ever seen in efficiency and it's doing it with a nearly 1 foot air gap.

I'm also highly skeptical since this company has been issuing the same press releases ""working on testing with GM"" and things like that for SEVEN years and I can't find any evidence of deployed stations anywhere.

Edit:  I just spent the last 20 minutes or so searching for SOME kind of third party testing.

"Ah gotcha, so user retrofit is not possible then. That’s unfortunate but at that price the cost of a service center doing so is likely minuscule.

The front doors of the Model X without ultrasonic sensors are not capable of fully opening automatically. [It is documented in the owner’s manual](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modelx/en_us/GUID-7A32EC01-A17E-42CC-A15B-2E0A39FD07AB.html).

I need to replace my front bumper, which I’m working on doing myself (the valance fascia shield is the most difficult part of it tbh lol) and was considering attempting an ultrasonic retrofit for the sole purpose of potentially enabling that functionality.

One (the only one I really spoke to) service tech here on Reddit has told me that, from what they know, the ultrasonic sensors actually aren’t related to the fully-opening automatic front doors on the X. Doesn’t really make much sense either, as it is specifically the models without USS that lack the functionality.

I apologize for going off-topic, I’ve posted about this before on several places and didn’t really get much helpful feedback besides the one service tech who responded, which might’ve been either on r/TeslaLounge or r/Autobody.",teslamotors

I actually love the yoke and think I would like it even more if it was steer-by-wire.

Future versions of MS and MX will almost certainly move to 48V architecture at some point and make this a possibility.,teslamotors

I can absolutely confirm from personal experience driving a private vehicle that a Model S long range is faster than acceleration boost model 3.  In the 0-60 mph, it’s about the same as my Model 3 Performance without special prep, if I take care to heat the batteries, put it on a strip, etc, then I’m getting faster times in the S.

Elon is no stranger to running cutting-edge builds on his personal vehicle, which is typically (and exclusively) permitted on company-owned vehicles intended for ADAS testing. Even general employees only have access to “Wave 1”, an early access program, which are refined and ready-to-ship versions of software updates.

A month ago, I shared that the Tesla team had only begun testing Autopilot on Cybertrucks in the first week of February. This sentiment appears to be true as even the cutting-edge builds don’t yet have a version of Autopilot or Full Self-Driving stable enough for Elon to test himself.

I've had days that I mostly used FSD, but the manual right turn into my apartment complex that is not FSD-guided will sometimes ding me for an improper turn.

The UK is good at that regulation In large part because they've had autonomous cars operating for over a decade in selected area around people. But they've also got good laws(with more coming) and regs designed practically to answer the autonomy on the roads question well ahead of most countries. They went to the regulator and DfT showed their evidence, signed up to take the liability per the law and got permission to drive on real roads hands free. 


Tesla could have done that, they didn't, that doesn't fill with confidence. And it's bad for consumers as they sell EAP for a premium, and it's not available because they simply don't want to follow the law that Ford of all companies managed to navigate in less than 6 months with a less mature product.

"From the article: February saw plugin EVs take 92.1% share in Norway, up from 90.1% year on year. Following the recent tax changes, BEVs alone were above 90% share for the second consecutive month. Overall auto volume remained well below seasonal norms, at 7,380 units. The Tesla Model Y sold 1,747 units, almost a quarter of the entire market.

February saw combined EVs take 92.1% share in Norway, comprising 90.1% full electrics (BEVs) and 2.0% plugin hybrids (PHEVs). These compare with YoY figures of 90.1% combined in February 2023, 83.1% BEV and 7.0% PHEV.

Recall that recent policy changes have disrupted the balance of powertrains, with a pull-forward of non-BEV sales before January 1st and a hangover for them since. This is why PHEV sales have been unusually low for the past two months.

Thing is, you're definitely not alone, and that's the crux of the issue. I've written about this before, but basically EVs make a lot more sense as owned cars than they do as rentals. In your daily life you have a predictable routine, a (hopefully) predictable place to charge, you're not driving too far in a typical day, you get to reap the benefits of the low maintenance/running costs, etc.. In a rental situation, it's very likely none of that is true, at which point an EV becomes more of a liability than a benefit. 

My biggest concern is rental companies' forays into EVs may have actually set back EV adoption, as many people's first EV experience will be a rental, they'll experience all of the downsides without realizing those downsides don't exist when you own, go ""this sucks, I'll never buy an EV now!"" and proceed to never do so.",teslamotors

Companies do not pay taxes.  Any taxes they do pay, are passed onto consumers.  Consumers will end up paying company taxes in the form of more expensive goods.

More expensive domestic goods, incentivizes import of international goods and disincentives manufacturing in the United States.  Thus risking domestic jobs.

&#x200B;

So, the United States tax code gives companies tax breaks for growing.  The premise is that growing businesses creates jobs, which is an overall better outcome for the consumer and the economy rather than adding another tax onto consumers by proxy.

&#x200B;

No matter how companies shuffle domestic money around, through LLCs and Holding Companies, they still must grow or pay taxes.  And most will choose to grow instead of paying taxes.

I've camped in rainstorms in the jungle of Hawaii as well as several feet of snow in American National Parks.

A normal cheap ground tent takes as much, if not more, work and time to set up and take down as Tesla's Basecamp tent.

Unless you're camping in the most extreme conditions (eg Everest) you don't need a thermally insulated tent. That's what thermal sleeping bags and thermal base layer clothing is for.

Is $3,000 expensive? Depends how much disposable income you have. After all, their target audience is someone who can afford an $80-100k truck. Compared to the price of accessories and upgrades from ""Luxury car makers"" (eg Porsche), $3,000 for a tent doesn't seem egregious.

Can you buy an equally good, if not better, ground tent for less? Yes, obviously. But again, this is a different target audience. If you really care about camping in the remote wilderness, you need to hike for hours with a 30-50lb backpack, on remote trails that yoiu can't get to with an off-road vehicle anyway. People who doe this are willing to sacrifice ""comfort"" because they know that's the price you have to pay.

OTOH if you want to go ""glamping"" in a custom fitted tent that sets up in the bed of your $80k+ truck... you're going to have to pay extra. Make no mistake, this is a luxury item and it has a luxury price.

"I think it depends on how you define ""fail"". I don't see Tesla going completely out of business barring some major administrative mistakes, but it isn't at all decided whether they stay on top once every other manufacturer is making EV's as well. Tesla has the first mover advantage, they did electric first and there are some big benefits that come from that, but the traditional automakers are very good at manufacturing at scale, which is something that Tesla has struggled with. When the world needs 10m new EV's per year, will Tesla be able to scale faster than Ford or Toyota can electrify? Also, when it comes time for current Toyota owners to upgrade, are they going to prefer a Tesla because they're the king in electric, or a Toyota because it's what they know?  


Tesla could end up with 40% market share or 4% market share, and it all depends on how which factors end up being the most important.

"There are a lot of Tesla haters out there. 

Tesla is a threat to the ICE industry and they probably hire people to smear Tesla in an attempt to stave off bankruptcy. 

I don't exactly agree that the push to electrify everything was appropriately timed, but in the end, it's about time we transitioned to a superior technology that has sustainability. 

Right now, we're seeing a lot of issues that are commonplace with all newly developed technology. Tesla is the only EV manufacturer that is already in full production with most of the kinks worked out. All the other EV brands are having all sorts of problems and they simply can't match what Tesla has accomplished in such a short time. They probably thought they could just reuse their ICE production and adapt electric powertrains and batteries... unfortunately for them, it simply doesn't work well enough that way. 

Tesla started from the ground up with engineering to optimize (something ICE hasn't done much of for years because they were mostly content with the status quo) EV production. 

In such a short time, Tesla has went from the newest vehicle manufacturer in the world to the brand with the most popular model in the world. 

The ICE industry didn't have motivation to change anything for so long, it's their own fault for getting complacent.",teslamotors
"I’m probably overly optimistic, but I think when there’s several million of these out of warranty after 2026 that there will be many more companies and options for battery/module replacement driving down the costs.

"I'm convinced that the rental model is just too inflexible for them to get enough value out of it. They should really plan on running the EV's for a 100-150k miles, longer than their ICE cars. Teslas feel less dated than normal ICE cars after that time, and the maintenance costs are where Hertz would start getting more benefit.

I hate renting Teslas from Hertz now though, so maybe I'm biased. It felt like they already gave up months ago--barely maintain the cars, alignment off, dirty, damaged. The average ICE car they have is maintained better.",teslamotors

And on a daily basis, my daily commute dropping off kids and then going to work is almost doubled if I have to go to the gas station, so avoiding unexpected gas station trips is highly valuable.

I guarantee that even if I counted every minute of super charging that we have to do, it would be less than the total time we would spend getting gas.  Plus there's no standing outside in the cold for it.

When Tesla has a high demand product and production was constrained to 1-2 factories worldwide —-they had relatively high demand and relatively low supply.

What do you think that does to prices? 

Additionally, when you go to a traditional a  as dealer and see a lot full of new and used cars —-its pretty clear there is adequate (or over) supply and theres more dealers nearby competing (on price) for the sale.

Tesla has fixed pricing, and no opportunity to haggle. There are few vehicles sitting around the showroom, and you have to order and wait —-the demand is high enough that people will wait in many cases after configuring exactly what they wanted online (a demand lever)

Price is highest when demand exceeds production, prices fell when production ramped substantially (it has ramped substantially ever year since model 3).

In town with a speed limit of 25mph, the car displayed a speed limit of 50mph. Fortunately, the car never got to 50 but that may have been entirely due to another car in front of me.

It just wouldn't be the first time I've heard of a patent be about some recombination of existing tech, that still doesn't add up to a fundamentally new thing, but was specifically filed to either create a royalty revenue stream or outright prevent others from using it.

For a 6 ft cable, you'd have 0.000294 ohms which would result in 45W of power lost in the cable at 380A.  45W would get decently warm, but probably acceptable, especially outside for a short time.  In the sun on a hot day, it might get too hot.

 0.46 in diameter copper, for 6ft, with two conductors gives 24in\^3 or 3.5kg copper, with a value of $30.

I can deal with the speed being a little short. What really changed for me is the fact that the car straddles the lines on both sides, the white and yellow line. Sometimes so much so that it hits the sleep barrier in the middle lane, and it's not a great feeling traveling on a road with cars going 55+ in the opposite direction feelings like they are coming way to close for comfort.. so much so that I felt like I needed to take over on a few different occasions.. I know people are having lots of good things to say about this update, and after watching all the videos online, I was so excited to try it.. but after this first drive, I'm less than impressed with the performance and really hope that since so many people are talking about these issues, it gets a patch and soon.. my fear is instead of progress, we have shortcomings, and that just doesn't seem like the direction tesla should be headed in..

"If they just took the model s powertrain and put it into the mdoel 3, that would be a total win. 670hp on tap, probably detuned to around 550. but can you imagine 670 electric hp with awd grip? that would be so much more than fast. the regular model s even though it does 0-60 in the same 3.1s, its faster than the old m3p because it has 670hp vs 455hp. just imagine how much quicker it would be to 60, and how much faster it would be in the 1/4 mile.

the old m3p is already so fast and honestly the 0-60 in a LR model x which is 3.8 is still FAST. like, chasing going faster and faster eventually makes you loose sight of just how fast the original model 3 performance already is. so i hope they make it more performance oriented in more ways than just speed.",teslamotors

I'm sure the M3 performance will be great, but it's not a true sports car. It's too large and heavy.

Instead of chasing dumb and expensive feats like 0-60 in 1 second, I wish the roadster's main design goals were:
- starting price of $50k
- lowest weight spec under 3,000lbs
- rear wheel drive only. Starting with single motor, upper trims dual motor but still RWD
- 300kw charging with an amazing charging curve
- huge focus on connected driving feel

Instead we have to hope that Porsche Cayman/Boxster EVs will have targets like these, but we know they will start at $100k because it's Porsche. And probably they will still be too heavy.

Pros:
1. Does better job on 2 way unlined roads. V11 would ride the middle and play chicken with oncoming traffic. V12 stays to the side and juts middle when it needs to (although it did roll over a lowered sewer grate 1/3 times. 
2. Better in parking lots (v11 would go over empty parking spots and veer around)

Cons:
1. The low speed, 55 limit, car set to 63, doing 45. Multiple times. 
2. Weird lane selection that didn’t exist in v11. 
2a. Divided Highway 2 lane express; 2 lane local. V11 got over 1-0.5 miles before split. V12 just misses the split every time not bothering to get over unless I signal it. 
2b. 2 exits after each other, car wants second exit but moves into exit lane for first exit goes about 50 feet then merges back into non-exit lane. V11 never did this.",teslamotors

If they could, Rivian would already have done it. For any car company it's probably better for them to just start from scratch. 

The only thing i can see of value would be the property, plant, and equipment - which if Tesla or any other company could acquire at a significant discount to face value might be worth buying. 

If you look at their balance sheet you'll see Rivian's Net PPE is valued at $4,230,000,000. So i would really say the ""floor"" on Rivian is sub $4B + whatever cash they have on hand.

"Yea, it was a tractor trailer mounted mobile system. Essentially the equipment would be retrofitted to an existing diesel trucking fleet and the over the road shipping process would produce water. The awg takes advantage of the forward movement of the truck and the drying element conditions air prior to entering the diesel engine. The awg has two identical moving parts that contain an engineered molecular sieve. One part sits at the front of the vehicle gathering moisture from the air passing over it, the second part is set in a housing around the exhaust pipe that functions as an oven. The part in the exhaust oven hits its release temperature and the water is removed from the part then condenses into an on board tank.  The tech takes energy normally wasted and produces a mobile deliverable water supply and raises efficiency for the individual diesel motors. It becomes a formula of gallons of water per container per mile, now imagine if it was a regulated requirement for interstate trucking. It grabs some pollutants as well.",teslamotors

I need to spend $1500 on a painted bumper anyway, and since I already bought the (incorrect for now) USS-compatible left-hand fender fairing/garnish, it would only be an extra $70 for the right-hand USS fairing/garnish, plus the sensors, sensor assembly parts, and wiring harnesses, which I’d estimate to total out to $500 but I could be wrong (have no idea how much the sensors are).",teslamotors

Otherwise a Mach-E could take up one space and create confusion when a Tesla pulls up to the spot next to it where it will be unable to charge.

I do think that Tesla needs to add some kind of graphic/alert in the Tesla app or inside the Tesla's charging screen to notify Tesla owners that a Ford is charging and taking up 2 spots, as per ""designed"", otherwise arguments would probably happen. It probably will anyway, but at least if they make it an ""official recommendation"" then people would eventually get used to it.

"Armchair engineers crack me up.  It's worth remembering that Sentry mode wasn't even a consideration for the Model 3 design; it came out [over two years](https://electrek.co/2019/02/13/tesla-sentry-mode/) after production.

Still, you might try to draw parallels with a <45W laptop or modern mid-range gaming PC and assume they left massive efficiency gains on the table or the computers are overly power-hungry, but a lot of Model 3s on the road are still running an Intel Atom instrument cluster with a TDP of [5-10 W](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/in-vehicle-solutions-platform-brief.pdf) (the AMD APU is likely not much higher) and the autopilot computer HW3 TDP is [72W](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucp0TTmvqOE&t=5500s), so the compute budget is already only 1/3rd of the total power the car consumes while awake, but within that 1/3rd it's running neural detection nets on at least 4 (and as many as 8) camera inputs 24x7 to bring you that Sentry mode. It's not simply recording & dumping clips to storage. 

There's three additional [body controller boards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVCHC2cw0v0) to operate all the various accessories & sensors that a car must operate when awake, not including the various BMS hardware in the penthouse to always monitor the battery health, cell radio, Wi-Fi radio, multiple Bluetooth radios, multiple NFC radios, etc.  The [cooling loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgfXyLLaO7I) isn't some 120mm AIO from Corsair either, it's two always-on automotive grade pumps capable of moving up to 30 L/m of glycol through a loop the length and width of a car and a similarly upscaled radiator - idle efficiency probably wasn't their primary design constraint for cooling.  It's also being powered by the 400V battery converted to 12V DC by the [power conversion system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ARHdRwfxjY) with only [37W of DC-DC](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/iws58g/model_3_factfinding_an_endtoend_efficiency/) conversion losses, which is spectacular considering its computer analogue would be a 2500W 12V PSU with an 80 Plus Titanium rating.  

I'm eager to test it when the update comes out, but I'm skeptical this ~40% vampire drain reduction will be available to any but the newest vehicles, if at all.  There's simply too much car built around the computers to shave off that much power.",teslamotors
"Always look at incentives. What are the incentives of the IIHS? Note that the IIHS is entirely funded by the insurance industry. Yes, they care about safety, but only as a means to insurace industry profits, not as an end in itself. To the extent that safety (or lack thereof) affects insurance industry profits, they will act to increase safety. For example if unsafe cars or unsafe driving is costing the industry money by increasing the cost of claims, then the insurance industry will take action.

But what happens if self driving cars become wildly successful and supremely safe? Suddenly there's a lot less money to be made in the insurance industry. The safer your cars are, the less insurance they need. So the IIHS doesn't have any particular incentive to actually move the technology of self-driving cars forward, and lots of incentive to put up roadblocks in their way.

Based on the incentives, the IIHS absolutely does care about hindering Tesla in their quest for true self-driving cars.",teslamotors

"I could be mistaken, but my understanding is there are three flavors of supercharger. The original (v2?) 150kw chargers, the newer 250kw chargers (no 'magic dock'), and the 250kw chargers WITH 'magic dock'. The older chargers ONLY work with Teslas - presumably because they can't communicate via 'canbus' with non-teslas to manage the charge session. The 250kw chargers w/o 'magic dock' appear to be what they are calling 'NACS' chargers and should work with ANY CCS EV (with an adapter) once Tesla opens them up, which sounds like that's going to be announced by manufacturer (starting soon with Ford?).  The 250kw chargers with 'magic dock' work NOW with any CCS EV using the built-in adapter and the Tesla app. 

A quick glance over the rather confusing map linked in the header appears to support this based on what I know about the superchargers in my area, which are a mix of all three. 

I'm thinking the fact the 'more popular / busier locations' aren’t being opened to non-teslas isn’t so much due to traffic and capacity but because they were the most obvious locations to get chargers first and therefore have the older non-NACS compliant 150kw hardware that was first widely rolled out and will need to be upgraded.",teslamotors

His brother FOUNDED Zip with Elon. You are just parroting long disproven junk. 

There is no evidence Elon has taken any considerable money from his father. 

Tesla does make money from selling carbon credits. That's part of their business model that he setup. Why is that bad? Also, it's still profitable by a very large margin if that were zero. You can look up their GAAP income statements. 

Tesla has lower incident reports than the industry average. 

SpaceX not being ""successful"" is one of the dumbest things I have legitimately ever heard. They are the only way American's can currently get into space, are BY FAR the largest commercial operating in the world, have the worlds only self landing, reusable orbital stage in the world, and launch more payload mass into orbit THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD *COMBINED*. They have had more consecutive successful launches than any other rocket in history. They operate at a lower cost (look at reusability) than any other rocket in history. 

I know no matter how many facts, or how well supported these statements are made, you won't be swayed. You've made your opinion by reading misguided information, and that's now ""your truth"".

Like seriously, they could easily get an electric motor like Nissan or Fiat did, and slap it in where the front motor goes currently.

Where the fuel tank goes, they can put a sizable battery there. Do it right and they can achieve likely about 100-200 miles range.

Counter intuitive it might have been , but she should have roll down her front window , let the water rush into the car, because once the car is fully submerged , even with mechanical latch it would be impossible to push the door open cos of the pressure.

If she was quick , she could have a good chance to get out from the driver side window, but if not and the water is rapidly rushing in preventing egress , again stay cool, take one big last gulp of air before water fills up the car completely , then she could easily open the door mechanically when the pressure equalises , or if like most people who don’t know there is a mechanical latch , at this point just egress from the rolled down window

"That’s a utopian spin on this decision for current Tesla owners that bought, in part, because of the dedicated Supercharging network.  

Let me give the dystopian spin on this:

1.  As a Tesla owner, I have no desire to use any other charging network.  I’ve been all over the country and, for Level 3 charging, never needed anything other than Tesla’s network.  So I don’t care about the CCS issue.  If it was up to me, let the other brands keep their bulky CCS ports and chargers.  

2.  Tesla cut the same deal with just about every other major EV maker (companies selling in the US).   They agreed not to charge other car owners more than Tesla owners.  A really stupid concession. Adding the other cars will put a strain on the network and  cause Tesla to increase prices.  And because they can’t discriminate under their agreements with Ford and others, Tesla owners will end up paying more, not less, per kilowatt hour.  

3.  The current Tesla network, with the very limited exception of the few Version 4 chargers, is designed with the placement of the Tesla charge port.  The other car owners will take up multiple spots, pull and damage supercharger cables, and other unforeseeable issues.  This will be a logistic nightmare for Tesla owners.  

4.  Tesla will lose out in the end.  It will turn out that Elon’s ego didn’t let him see that people bought Teslas in large part for the proprietary charging network.  With this boneheaded decision, Tesla will lose customers, be hurt financially, with yet unseen consequences for current owners.

EDIT: In bullet 2, I said that Tesla agreed to charge the same for non Tesla owners.  In the Tesla and Ford press releases at the time of the deal, that’s what they said.  It appears from the comments below that is not the case. We will see how this plays out in time as more brands have access.  I will note that in the YouTube video one person attached, they noted that Tesla was still more than 10 cents a kilowatt hour cheaper than EA in the same town.",teslamotors

"And precisely how many European roads can comfortably accommodate a 7' wide Ram 3500 dually? Seems like even ignoring the massive taxes Europeans love, it's not really a pragmatic choice for that market.

For instance, truckers in Europe favor the Cab-Over-Engine design, which is less fuel efficient at speed, because of the maneuverability they get when having to navigate city roads that were designed for horses. The U.S. has thousands of miles of empty highways, so the long haul truckers favor the Conventional cab because they get a 5-10% advantage in their fuel economy numbers, which is significant when your haul is 2000 miles. All but our oldest cities will accommodate these vehicles.

Do note, however, that the first half of 2023 did see SUVs make up 51% of new vehicle sales in Europe. They're a little behind, but it seems like they're catching up as much as their infrastructure will allow. They just have to suffer the tiny engines their governments allow.

The 'loophole' in the CAFE standards was a concession made because farmers, tradesmen, etc, all need their trucks to do real work. This might explain why it's basically impossible for us to have small pickups like the old Ranger/Mazda B series or the old Toyotas we got in the 80s. They're defacto banned!

The problem with crafting a definition is that people will always find a way around it if it means saving money or time. You can't get around the power of incentive, but it sure does breed innovation. Consider the silly firearms laws in the U.S. attempting to [classify firearms](https://preview.redd.it/still-the-best-nfa-atf-meme-v0-495xlwcm0ogc1.jpeg?auto=webp&s=c77c638ee7655549c3c47d58fe0fc29fe1230837) (I apologize for the tacky commentary on the image, but the classifications are correct).

And don't get me wrong - I drive a MINI Cooper (now passed down to my son) and a hybrid Ford Maverick. I don't need a large or powerful vehicle so I don't really have any skin in this game. I get 50mpg in that Maverick commuting 30 miles unless traffic is clear.

Canada allows matrix headlamps that conform the ECE rules, the NHTSA in the US decided it wanted to be different and make it extremely difficult to develop a solution that allows matrix headlamps.

And the main reason is this, from the above link:

>More specifically, NHTSA's rules require adaptive headlights to respond extremely fast after detecting another vehicle. This is not only much faster than other standards in use in Europe and Canada but also quicker than humans could switch regular high beams. They also dictate extremely narrow lines between bright and dark regions of the light beam, which is difficult to achieve in practice. This prevents current matrix LED headlamps from ever being switched on in the US. Instead, carmakers will be forced to redesign their adaptive headlights according to US regulations.",teslamotors

So for the entire package, including the car - today"". Which is ~180k ish.

"Just because a road has a speed limit doesn’t mean that going that speed is the safest speed to travel. If 90% of the drivers are on a certain road are going 10-15mph over the speed limit that means all of those cars now have to pass you. Each time you pass a car or a car passes you there is an increased probability of a collision. If cars are pacing each other there’s less probability of getting in an accident. It’s not about breaking the law, it’s about driving safely. That’s the exact reason there is a new button in FSD that tries to match your speed with traffic. It’s safer to do so! 

And ok let’s completely destroy your logic here. Some roads also have speed minimums where you can’t go below a certain speed limit due to an increased risk of a collision if you do so. Say this road has a speed minimum of 45mph meaning you shouldn’t go below that speed. Say this same road now has snow on it and a moose stumbles out onto the highway. Are you still going to go 45+ because a sign told you to? The same logic applies to speed limits. It’s just not as exaggerated. Would it be nice if everyone was a good little sheep and followed the speed limit? Sure! But that’s a magic fairy land we don’t live in and Tesla knows that either allowing the car to match the speed of traffic or having an offset of a certain % over the speed limit is a safer option.",teslamotors
"I spoke incorrectly. I mentioned it in my initial service request. Just not the fact that I wanted a round wheel.

When I dropped it off I asked the person checking me in to add the round wheel to my service.  Old version or new, I didn't care.

He stated the new ones hadn't arrived. But quoted me $0 verbally.

While waiting for my service to be completed I was called out to talk to a manager. He quoted me $1500 for a new yoke. I told him I didn't want a yoke. He pulled up the replacement cost of a round steering wheel in his computer. Still $1500.

Told me explicitly it wasn't covered, that it was cosmetic & I had to pay.

I refused & he left. His co-workers said he was wrong & put in for an escalation.

Nothing came of it.

That was in February.

"This really baffled me with the Plaid refresh. I was completely onboard replacing my old P85D with the next Model S refresh, but what they presented was the exact opposite of what I wanted.

The issue with the Model S was never performance; it was ridiculously quick already. What I wanted was better materials, more comfortable seats, soft closing doors, better driving characteristics and things like that. Make it an actual premium vehicle.

Instead, they cheapened the interior even more, removed almost all physical controls, removed sensors and made it a bit quicker.",teslamotors

"Tesla's board of directors is the only sad state. I've been active on this subreddit since 2015 when I bought my first Tesla. Back then, there was enthusiasm for the products and the company. Most of us believed in the vision and possibilities of a company full of brilliant engineers creating great, transformative products. We were evangelists, boring people at cocktail parties and giving randos test rides in our cars. 

But the sycophantic board failed to do it's job. It refused to make difficult decisions when the leadership of the company spiraled into delusion and mental illness, becoming a liability to the company's mission.

"It's extremely hard to break into the car industry as a new entrant, even if your car is very good. That's why Model 3 almost killed Tesla, even though it would go on to be the best-selling premium sedan in the world (which means it's an extremely good product).",teslamotors

"What redundant systems does a human driven car have if the driver passes out while on the freeway? The FSD has redundant processing chips btw.

In scenarios the system cant handle, why couldn't the car simply pull over safely and say, 'out of operation due to malfunction'.

Why couldn't there be a manual override also. You may argue well that's not FSD but again you have to quantify what is meant. A system that 99.999% of the time drives on its own, is pretty self driving. The fact once every 5 years a human might have to take control to overcome some edge case scenario, for all practical purposes that's an automated system. Even systems as basic as an elevator might breakdown occasionally and need maintainance / repair. I'm sure the odd elevator related accident has happened. Do we fret about the saftey of elevators even though they may occasionally result in accident. 

3 people dying every 5 years due to FSD malfunction is alot better than 10k people per year dying. It will be accepted, even if 3 people are still killed.

There are situations that humans cant handle, such as kids running out from behind parked cars, human not reacting in time. Perhaps computer system can react faster.

Its tolerable to allow a human driver to occasionally run over a kid but not for a computer system to also occasionally run over a kid but much less frequently? 

FSD doesn't have to be perfect or flawless, just like how humans are not perfect or flawless. Once it can be quantifiably shown to be statistically safer, to not allow FSD would then be the decision costing lives.

"An interesting consideration in this scenario would be given actual instances of a child running infront of said cars what is the percentage that the child actually gets hit.

Lets say that Teslas were able to avoid pedestrian accidents automatically 85% of the time, then they beat out vehicles with out the optional feature installed, which would mean that trucks not equipped with that standard would hit 100% of said children vs the 15% of the time in Teslas.

">Old ways die hard.

But just because they're old ways, does that automatically mean they're bad ways? You lose a lot of situational awareness if you're trained to look down inside your car for everything, instead of side mirrors.

Example: you're in the far right lane, want to merge into the center lane. Turn your signal on, look down at your screen and merge. At the same time, the car in the far-left lane a bit ahead of you starts merging over to the middle lane, but you don't see it because your attention is on the screen inside your car.

As opposed to a light on or near the mirror, you're looking over to your left already, and you'll spot the other car moving over because your eyes are already in that direction.",teslamotors

It was definitely not going to work for the customer... but they also didn't start out like that.  We had a Tesla from Hertz once, and it only had to come back with something tiny like 10 or 20%.  I'm guessing that didn't work for Hertz because they didn't have a way to get charging infrastructure at their lot, didn't have the manpower to take them to superchargers, and/or were losing too much time letting a car fill up over eight hours if it was dropped off pretty empty.  So they went from ""unworkable for Hertz"" to ""unworkable for renters"" and gave up rather than work on the infrastructure to make it workable.

To some degree, it might not even have been an unwillingness to install chargers-- I'm guessing they don't own the lots and garages they use at airports, for example, and the airport probably doesn't care enough to help Hertz make infrastructure upgrades.",teslamotors

"They allow the car to drive over the speed limit because it’s safer for it to drive like a real person than follow arbitrary hard rules. Tesla knows the math. They know that whenever you pass someone or someone passes you the probability of an accident increases. 

Let’s create a model thought problem. Say we built a computer program where you had 3 cars in a row. Each one of these cars keeps the same distance from each other and matches each others speed 100% of the time. This computer program also allows each of these cars to move to a lane to the left or to the right without checking to see if there’s another car there. How often will there be a collision? 0% of the time because they are keeping a set speed and distance regardless of the lane they are in. 

Now let’s change the experiment. Let’s say that we have the same computer program except every time the car that is in last place it has to increase its speed and pass the other 2 cars to get to spot 1. Now let’s keep the same parameters as before where each car can change its lane without checking if there is another car in the lane next to it. Now how many collisions are we going to have? The chances of a collision are now much greater because now there is a higher probability of a car being in the lane next to you. 

Point being if you allow yourself to only go the speed limit when traffic is going faster you are increasing your likelihood of being in an accident due to a higher probability of a car either coming into your lane or you changing lanes into theirs. In fact if all cars matched their speed and distance and never had to pass one another there would be no need to have a speed limit.",teslamotors

"And doing the speed limit on certain roads greatly increases your likelihood of getting in an accident. So what’s your point? If you are going the exact speed limit on a road where 90%+ of the other drivers are going 10-15mph over, all of those cars have to pass you. Every time you pass a car or other cars pass you there is potential for an accident. Even if that % is .001% it’s still higher than 0%. Now let’s take a situation where everyone is going 10-15mph over the speed limit. Now less cars are passing each other because they are pacing each other. Is there still a chance of an accident? Sure, it’s still not 0% but I’ll take .0001% over .001% every time. Just because there’s a speed limit it doesn’t mean it’s the safest to drive at that speed. We know this and that’s why some roads have speed minimums too. 

But let’s take this a step further. Say the road that you are on has a speed minimum set at 45mph but it’s snowing and a moose walks out onto the highway, are you going to continue to go 45 or above because a sign says you’re not “allowed” to go slower? Of course not, but it illustrates my point. The same is true for speed limits but the examples aren’t as apparent or extreme. 

When it comes to FSD 12.3 the point people are trying to make is that 11.9 getting up to speed quicker and adjusting due to road conditions or traffic is not only safer but also closer to how a normal person drives. FSD is supposed to be on a track to full autonomous driving and in this instance we’ve taken a step backward. I do however think 12.3 as a whole is a step forward and do believe that switching to the new neural network model is the correct path to true autonomous driving. But just like when phone companies drastically change course in an operating system, the first release typically has more bugs and tradeoffs. It incrementally gets better over time with revisions of the base release.",teslamotors

"From the article: Tesla has decided to leave Australia’s Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI), a major auto lobby group, over accusations that the organization made “demonstrably false” claims regarding the government’s proposed clean car policy.

As we reported earlier this week, Tesla’s criticism focuses on the FCAI’s claims that the government’s CO2 scheme would substantially increase the prices of most cars. Tesla argues that these claims mislead consumers and inaccurately represent the potential impact of the NVES, which aims to reduce vehicle emissions through stricter efficiency standards.

According to Tesla, the FCAI’s narrative suggests that implementing the NVES would force most car prices to surge by thousands of dollar. In a 7 page letter which you can read at the bottom of this article, Tesla says that this is not only misleading but also harms consumer perceptions and market dynamics.

The company points out that while the FCAI projects a dramatic price hike for gas-powered vehicles, it falsely claims that Tesla’s electric vehicles (EVs) would see significant price reductions, as much as 25%, which the automaker says can lead to consumers not purchasing a Tesla with the belief that they will be dropping in price substantially in the near future. Not only that, but that those consumers will purchase a gas-guzzling car “in anticipation of soaring resale values.”",teslamotors

That was not my intent.


>When driving long stretches w electric every minute counts, so not wasting 20kms on sentry would be great


My understanding is Sentry Mode has no real effect on range while you are driving.


I could see a case for charging up the night before a big trip and then losing 10-20 kms overnight before leaving in the morning but, unless the first Supercharger is right at the edge of your range, that loss should not impact your trip.


>Anyway, there are a ton of use cases where this benefits the owners, glad they will do it


Completely agree. My goal in questioning the ""long term use case"" comment above is that there are probably very few use cases that are affected by Sentry Mode drain. People like to make a big deal about the excessive drain, and it is excessive, but I was curious to learn about potential scenarios I had not considered.

"Nearly every automaker has level 2 autonomous driving in at least one of their models. Tesla’s FSD isn’t even amongst the best, and it’s presumptuous to believe no auto manufacturer can catch up and surpass Tesla’s FSD in such short timeframe. Elon and Tesla have been over promising for nearly a decade now, and probably assumed the market won’t catch up to the lead Tesla started, but that is catching up on them real quick. 

Ford, BMW, Mercedes, just to name a few, already have really good hands free autonomous driving that I would consider as good, if not better than FSD. Not only would they be as good, they are advancing at a quicker rate than Tesla, with Mercedes already introducing the first L3 car within the US.

Yea, Jerry did pull a rather shady stunt to incite debate and receive clicks, but the stance is still a good stance. Tesla is falling behind, and Elon’s lies only bring harm to the drivers believing the lies. A lot of people need to understand Tesla isn’t FSD, and stop buying them with the belief they’re getting a product that doesn’t really exist with Tesla.

So basically I don’t think they’ve lost much time on this.  It was going to take a lot of time and innovation to get to a truly low-cost design no matter what, so the choice was to get out a high-margin side product in the meantime, or nothing.",teslamotors

I didn’t trust it coming from 50 mph paved onto single lane dirt with deep ditches on each side. Once on my street and past the ditches I put it back in FSD and for the first time it cautiously drove at 7 mph looking for my driveway. In the past ver 11 would always try to go 25 which is a very bad idea where I am.

It does drive like a grandma, even when I set it to assertive, and I did have to encourage it with occasional touches to the accelerator. But, it is driving like a human.

Another person in the Las Vegas location, where I actually live and was going to buy my car, also confirm the same thing to me: that I could lease a model 3 and buy it out later.

So I leased a model 3, and I stupidly paid $10,000 for the  auto pilot for it because I thought I would get to keep it if I wanted to. Fast-forward and I learned they lied to me and leases were only for S and Xs… Now as I get close to my lease turn in date in June I’m pretty freaking livid. 

I had someone emailing, texting, and calling me from their “ Loyalty sales department” to “help get me in my next Tesla“. They were incredibly aggressive in trying to get in touch with me and start a conversation and were quite nice and communicative when I finally answered them, but the moment I dropped the above story and said I was only interested in buying out my lease… And that if I couldn’t this was going to be the last Tesla I ever owned… They have not spoken to or responded to me since.",teslamotors

"Tesla basically only have two high selling form factors which means consumers have little real choice. Compare that to a company like BYD who have:

- Sedans like the Qin Plus, Han and Seal
- SUV's like the Song Plus/Seal U/Tang/U8/Bao 5
- CUV's like the Atto 3/Song Pro
- Hatchbacks like the Dolphin and Seagull
- Even luxury minivans like the Denza D9

Whilst it is nice to have a product line that feels streamlined and apple-ified, it just boils down to having less choice on size, utility, luxury segment, features etc. 

If Tesla have 2 mass market products vs another brand with 20-30 (I think BYD have 34), obviously those two models will top the bestselling charts but it doesn't really mean too much. Long run it is likely that other brands will sell more as a whole unless Tesla can really start iterating faster.

"It’s a well know fact that Elon traded his emerald mine for his First Employee. He got really lucky and it was a good employee. That employee then hired all the other employees and paid them in emeralds via paypal, which was called ZipToX at the time. 

The employees then invented eBay so that they could sell their emeralds for money, and also sell PayPal (ZipToX) to the highest bidder. Elon was the secret highest bidder, because he traded his diamond mine from apartheid. Now owning PayPal (ZipToX) he changed the name to PayPal to seem nicer (Pal) so he would get friends because everyone knows rich people don’t have real friends. 

Since he was rich the banks gave him free money because of the leverage of his left over rubies. (They put the rubies on a see-saw and how ever much money they can lift is called the leverage and is free.)

His employees were working hard and made lots of money and Elon takes the money for free. He had to pay taxes once, though, because he forgot to turn off autopay.

The only reason SpaceX is successful is because Elon went to Russian and sold his South African racism secrets to Putin and they gave him an ICBM which he made his engineers take back to workshop on Christmas Day. Now they just reuse the ICBM for all the launches but since they call it a different number each time (falcons 1, falcons2, falcons 3 heavy, etc) everyone is tricked.

That being said, a few manufacturers are lobbying for NHTSA to relax the limitations and match what the EUs got going on so they can enable matrix for existing models if equipped / not need to redesign the headlights and introduce supplier and manufacturing complexity just to remain in compliance with both the US and other regions.

"""AI (Self driving) - Lots of players in the space not just Tesla""

Nope.  Not even close.

There is no-one doing real self driving except Tesla.  All of the others have approaches that use unreasonable amounts of hardware, or heavily pre-mapped environments that means they will never deploy outside a handful of cities, and even then eventually their AI will lag behind because of mappings getting stale and just die off compared to general purpose systems.

There is no-one else that has the volume of real world training data.  There is ino-one else with millions of cars deployed to real people that have powerful enough hardware to actually work.  

Tesla has a massive, probably 5-10 year moat in this regard.  Just in training data alone.

""Yeah and charging itself is a commodity not a profit center. ""

For Tesla this has become a profit center.  I assure you it is not commodity pricing.

"First of all, the current USS-based autopark feature Tesla has is trash, so I don't think it's unreasonable to believe there's a good chance that this new version is better than that. Therefore saying it's gonna be worse as if that's a fact without even seeing it in action is ridiculous.

That aside, ever since high-fidelity update came out, the vision-based park assist actually been pretty good. Far from perfect, but it's arguably better than the old USS-based park assist because it can detect more types of obstacles and represents them with far more detail. It's still not as precise as the USS version for simple obstacles, but it has its own advantages. And of course the software can always improve even more.

So yeah, I think the potential of vision-based autopark is quite high. After all, humans park with vision, and they generally do a good job (generally). So the potential is at least that good, and probably better. Now whether they can actually reach that potential with that software is an entirely different question, especially for this first iteration. That's where we'll have to wait and see.",teslamotors

"You make another great point, currently I don't have FSD so if new model or refresh has interesting features, I'd swap my car for the new one, but if I had paid for FSD, I would just try yo keep mine as long as possible, probably more than a decade, and would be unconsciously trying to convince myself ""nah the new one is not worth it, it's almost the same, I'll just keep my current one"".

And yeah, longer brand loyalty and retention shows in stats/news/articles/ranking lists, people get locked in the ""ecosystem"" (that's how Apple became the MOST valuable company in the world for some time and it's still 2nd place, and I don't even use Apple products but they seem to be really good at locking people in). 

Then more cars in the road clocking more miles and providing more telemetry to further improve FSD software. Seems like a no brainer. 

The monthly suscription option and free month is a great move though, some people once they try it they can't go back and that's what happened to me after the first time I test drove my model 3 performance, not FSD but the acceleration and instant torque, I ended up ordering shortly after test driving.",teslamotors

However, Steam has so far not been mentioned on any of Tesla’s marketing materials, and not appeared in any customer-owned Cybertrucks. As it turns out, that is because Tesla appears to be going down the same road with the Cybertruck as they did with the Model S/X.

According to hacker @greentheonly on X, the specs of the Cybertruck computer matches that of the early Model S/X builds, in that it only has 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. Another reason Steam has not appeared is that the Cybertruck might not have a discrete GPU (dGPU), something else that Tesla requires for Steam integration, although green said he was unsure on this point.

Regardless, green points out that unless Tesla relaxes their requirements (16GB RAM, 256GB storage) for Steam gaming, there will be no Cyberpunk, or any of the other thousands of games on the Steam platform, in your Cybertruck.",teslamotors

Afterward the first 3 cars were released the Model Y was announced to complete the S3XY line up. From what I can tell the Model Y's name is only a thing because the other cars were already S, 3, and X. The Model S and 3 names actually have an interesting history behind them while X and Y are just kinda cringe.",teslamotors

"Can you look at the cars as if they were personal computers and offer retrofits for retrofittable things?

Like the 1.0 to 2.0 center console upgrade in the Model 3/Y, things of that nature.

I get that, to an extent, it might drive away people from buying newer cars, at the same time, those of us who are content with our cars would gladly spend a little extra here and there to have certain retrofits done.

While you wouldn't get as much margin as selling a new car, it's still an avenue for sales to take place, and people to walk away happy.  If anything, this kind of service could also lead to adding more service centers, as they'd be able to bring in *some* revenue from retrofits, in addition to servicing vehicles.

Not just technology retrofits like MCU1 to 2, and AP HW2 to 3, but hardware retrofits.

As ADAS features are still options for many vehicles it is reasonable to note that automatic braking (along with other safety systems) comes standard with all models of Teslas sold. I will concede that a 5mph crash between a vehicle and a child will likely have a poorer outcome between a CT and another truck on the market, but how much poorer is tough to judge.

"I live in the netherlands, pretty much a walhalla for EV brands and we have BYD for a while now. The cheapest (the dolphin) is 30.000. Its a small city car, range of 340km and more or less a VW iD.3 competitor in size and feel (altho the id.3 is crazy expensive with 43.000) the cheapest ev we have is dacia for 20.000 which has 305km. 

For a good comparison you have to look at the same size and class of car. The BYD seal is basicly a Model 3. The price is 1000 euro’s more than the Tesla. Range is the same but with a 23kwh bigger battery, and slightly slower charging. 

The BYD Seal U is the Model Y, has 50km more range but on a 27 kwh bigger battery. Price and specs are near identical.

Used model 3’s here are 20-25.000 euro, but are prospected to drop to 15.000 because at end of year about 30.000 model 3’s who are sold 5 years ago for far far lower tax costs will lose their benefit at the end of the year.

And honestly if all cars were autonomous and were aware of each other at all times it would have been solved already. And we’d all be doing 150mph to work every day. Because there is human interaction that’s unpredictable is where 99% of the problems lie. Predicting human behavior or of  a car is the reason the problem is so difficult.

Remember this conversation. If you believe in any incremental advancement then eventually driving will be autonomous and when it does there will be real talks about outlawing human driving. When the great majority of accidents and deaths are due to human error we will look at self driving like we do drunk driving today.

If you drive 20,000 miles a year that means about 7 years before FSD messes up less often than you.

There's going to be a looonnnnnnnggggggg time between ""seems to drive perfectly."" and ""safer than me"".

You're going to think a safe/working FSD is released from your perspective but it'll be like 3x more dangerous than the average driver because it ""only"" crashes once every 2 years instead of every 7. Which is to say, safe/working FSD will be seen coming several miles away--so much so that you'll think it's already here long before it actually is.

Which is more proof of what a giant liar Elon has been all along.  We'll be close, when we think it's safer than a human, but it isn't close.  The final call on when FSD is safe will have to be made by Tesla using their data. Subjectively it'll feel done to any one individual user.",teslamotors
"Yeah it was super sketch.

Two parts to this, one I agree one I strongly disagree.

1) FSD is not full self driving and l2 right now. This is true. Tesla has been promising FSD for 8 years now, it’s not there yet, it’s still beta, it isn’t hands free (due to nhtsa). Until it’s can be regulated behind l3 the price is crazy for what you get today. It’s a promise for the future.

2) He says it’s just L2 which “everyone else has” suggesting some equivalency. This is ludicrous. No other company has anything close (except maybe Xpeng). It’s ludicrous to suggest ford’s blue cruise is as capable as Tesla FSD. Reading his tweets and than watching an FSD12 video and then watching his ford Mach e video..: it’s cringey. It’s like saying a blackberry circa 2002 is the same as an iPhone 15 because “ they are both smart phones”.

"No, you are wrong.  The Model 3 is currently ineligible for a Safety Pick + because it has not ***yet*** been evaluated for IIHS's two new tests: The new ""Moderate Overlap Front: Updated"" test and the new ""Side: Updated"" test.  It has nothing to do with the lower leg evaluation (which is on the  ""Small Overlap Front"" test, for which the Model 3 gets the highest rating of ""Good"" for both driver and passenger tests).

By contrast, the Model Y has already been evaluated on both of these two new tests (several months ago).  I follow IIHS closely and have noticed that over the last year or so, IIHS has been systematically testing cars based on these two new, more stringent tests.  What is different about these tests is that the new moderate overlap front (updated) test evaluates the passengers in the back seat and the new side (updated) uses a heavier truck moving at a faster speed.

Vehicles that have not been evaluated for the two new tests cannot be awarded a 2024 Top Safety + Pick for 2024.  IIHS made this clear more than a year ago.

All this leads to the following question: ""Why hasn't Tesla offered the Model 3 to be evaluated for these two new IIHS tests, which they have known about for a year?"" One (unverified) theory I've read is that due to the more stringent, updated Side test (with heavier barrier at faster speed), Tesla wanted to wait for the updated Highland M3, which has additional side protection due to a hook design that connects the center / bottom of the door to the frame. Alternatively, Tesla may not have seen the purpose in testing the pre-Highland 2024 for Safety Pick + when a new model 3 was right around the corner.",teslamotors

I have a 2019 Model 3 SR+, cars from this era were basically made with whatever was available, and Tesla just swapped out the battery packs.

My SR+, which as much as I think about trading it in, is quite unique, because I've got the frunk grocery hooks, fog lights, a smooth frunk, and rear seat heaters.

This was largely because in 2019 Tesla basically built one Model 3, and swapped out the battery, and motors, based on what the car was supposed to be.

So, SR+ vehicles ended up with Long Range cars, but different motors and less battery.

Some long ranges out there were known as ""LR-"", if memory serves, as they were Long Range cars with Performance motors in them, they were also known as ""sleepers"", because they were performance vehicles without the performance brakes, or tires.

The Model 3 ramp in 2017-2019 were *awesome* years for playing Russian Roulette on what kind of parts were going to be in your car, lol.

In my opinion, v12 crosses a line of utility where maybe another 400k people will pony up for it; those who are not expecting a robotaxi.  That translates to a market that values FSD on older cars.  Don't expect FSD to ever hold its value on a depreciated car.  FSD reasonably depreciates at the same rate.  But it is at least something that offsets paying again on the next car.",teslamotors

In the US it's a little better because it will follow through with a lane change it initiated if you're applying force to the wheel; you don't have to confirm with the indicator. Though it's still not great because applying force is basically a manual confirmation. FSD doesn't have this issue at all (in the US). It just initiates lane changes with no confirmation required from you whatsoever. 

But again, that's navigate on AP. I was talking about auto lane change, which is the feature where you indicate and it changes lanes for you. That's probably the main feature people get EAP for. If you don't have at least EAP, every time you want to change lanes you have to turn off AP, manually turn the wheel to change lanes, and then turn AP back on. It's much more convenient to just press the indicator and have it automatically change lanes for you, which is why that feature is the most desirable part of EAP.",teslamotors

Now that I use FSD I not only find I am MUCH less stressed from the long commute but I actually do get my time back in the form of entertainment I can engage with. I have read/listened too more books in the past year than the entire past decade combined. I think the value proposition for FSD is directly related to how much time you spend in the car.

"The problem with this is who assumes liability.  And It's aomething I'm concerned about no matter what.

If the driver manually ""dials up"" the speed offset so the car is exceeding the posted speed limit (as we all do today) and the car is involved in an accident, does Tesla still assume liability?
In other words: When FSD reaches Level 3 or above, will we lose the ability to manually adjust the maximum speed either directly, or by setting a speed offset parameter?
Or will the driver assume full liability if something happens while the NHTSA compliant settings are overridden either by a parameter change or manually accelerating through a stop sign or to speed up a pass on a highway?

Unlike in a political election, where people vote for a political party, company employees have no parties. Instead, workers vote for lists of nominees. Each union with members in the company can submit exactly one list with no further requirements. All other lists need a certain number of support signatures. Those non-union lists can be a single person, 20 people, or even every employee.

This means that one cannot compare the numbers on a list level. A union list may have 40 nominees, and there may be 40 1-person lists opposing. And, BTW, union lists really tend to be bigger than employee lists. Simply because unions only get one ""free"" list. Other lists are only as big as needed to get enough support signatures. Nobody wants to be on list position 99 when an 11-seat council is to be elected---even if that list got 100% of the votes, they'd never got onto the council.

Unions want an absolute majority on the council. Because then they can completely disable the democratic representation of the workers, as all the union council members will vote however the union demands them to vote. Here IG Metall failed to achieve this.",teslamotors

The report claims this is due to the driver monitoring being suboptimal, it makes lane changes without the driver’s input, it resumes TACC without the driver’s input after a long stop, you can’t steer with the system while it’s engaged, and a few other things. In practice, I found the driver monitoring to be pretty good, the eye tracking is definitely working.

the biggest issue is inconsistent build quality due to lack of oversight and pre-market development.

In layman’s terms, as a Tesla customer you either get a working vehicle or a lemon. The average Tesla owner doesn’t notice fit and finish issues so Tesla doesn’t check things like panel gaps and trim fitment.

If you want to escape by your car door, you'll have to wait until the car is completely underwater (see below).

"And to add to you saying that statistically driving faster increases your chances of getting into a crash. Yes but it’s not the speed that typically causes the crash. It’s one of 2 things that typically happens. When increasing the speed you need to increase the following distance to accommodate for someone abruptly stopping. Or someone is taking a turn faster than they should and lose traction. Both of these things are math problems that can be programmed or have sensors to solve. GPS, cameras, TCS (traction control system) and ABS (antilock braking system) found in a lot of modern cars are examples of these technologies. 

Besides there are 100% times you have used speed to avoid a collision. If you are in bumper to bumper traffic or have to stop abruptly and you look in the rear view mirror and see someone on their phone not paying attention. The lane or shoulder next to you is clear it makes sense to speed up and change lanes or move to the shoulder, right? It’s less about speed than it is about making correct and safe decisions. 

When we’re talking about being able to offset Tesla’s max speed we’re not talking about racing or setting it at crazy limits. Hell you can’t even set it more than 85mph. But even if you could set it at 150mph it would still lower its speed to follow the car in front of it at a safe distance. 

At the end of the day making a Tesla follow the exact speed limit versus allowing it to adjust its speed based on the flow of traffic makes the car less safe not more.",teslamotors

"The NHTSA required Tesla to stop at the stop line at stop signs. Often times this isn’t forward enough to see cross traffic. So the car has to stop at the legal stop line, then stop a bit further to actually see, THEN once it’s safe, it’ll go.",teslamotors
"Got the update yesterday night, and decided to go out on a quick test drive of the new feature. Excuse the lackluster video quality, it turns out the Insta360 X3 is not great at night footage.

My thoughts so far:

- As first software feature releases by Tesla go, this is definitely among the better ones. Very usable, will keep active and use from now on.

- There is no more ""normal"" auto high beams, it's either fully manual or adaptive / matrix with automatic engagement. You can still force them on or off with the stalk, and they auto-activate on AP, as high beams did before.

- It does a very good job lighting up the sides of the road far ahead, a lot better than normal low beams, and is very quick to mask out vehicles in front. Vehicles seem to be recognized reliably, very far out in front, and also when they're facing with their side to me (e.g. waiting at an intersection). Sometimes it recognizes other lights as cars and masks them out, but then lights up again once it clearly sees that that's not a vehicle.

- Dark masking areas around the vehicles are quite large, definitely erring on the side of caution. They update quite quickly, easily enough for normal driving - only in some edge cases, if a car enters the light cone very quickly from the side, or if I am changing direction quickly (going around a roundabout etc), the mask is _just_ too laggy to follow others perfectly in real-time.

- Cannot make out their logic for turning highs on and off when auto mode is engaged. When setting off in town, they stay off, and seem to come on once I exited the town onto a B-road. But then re-entering town, they stayed on. After disengaging manually and re-engaging, they again stayed off. A bit weird.",teslamotors

No, due to Tesla not having adequate driver monitoring.

It may be illegal with the letter of the law, but intersections aren't always built in a way that lets you follow the letter of the law exactly. 

It sounds like NHTSA is forcing Tesla to have the car stop once at the line, regardless of whether that spot allows visibility to  cross traffic or not, so the car then has to pull up and stop AGAIN at a spot where it can see.

It if the new price tanked to 30k during that, so you sell for 50% of that, you’d get 15k. But then only need to put in 15k to replace it. A net savings of 15k.

Tesla constantly does things merge into a weird/non-optimal position given upcoming turns or lane changes, frequently setting itself up for a last-minute adjustment needed to not box out an incoming car or itsefl. These aren't situations human drivers would ever put themselves into, and it makes for a ton of white-knuckling and second-guessing of whether the computer actually knows what is coming up in the next 10-20 seconds.

Waymo just handles all of these situations fluently. You just intuitively KNOW why it's doing x, y or z when it does it, because it's more how you would expect an actual person to drive, and you can tell that it's anticipating and adjusting to future conditions.

And the fact that it's happening fully autonomously in a dynamic/unpredictable driving situation like SF is insane. If Waymo was still stuck in downtown Phoenix, I could see the argument about it being cherry-pick-geofenced. But to operate the way it does throughout SF...it's bonkers how impressive that is, no matter how it's doing it.

"Hah nice post.

One of the advantages of training with a neural network and learning algorithms instead of ""write another 2,000 lines of C code"" that they were doing with V11 is that the learning shouldn't be as brittle.

The 2,000 lines of C code always broke down as they tried to make a car not miss a lane on a weird turn, it would pop up strange things in other areas.

With the learning algorithms, they just need to identify disengagement spots and have 8 or 10 ""teaching moments"" of a car doing that spot correctly and it should ""learn"" it next time.

Yeah, certain kinds of neural networks CAN fail in brittle ways so it's not impossible they'll regress in the future (just like a human can ""get bad habits""), but in general, I doubt it'll be as stark as it was before.",teslamotors

I don't think I've ever had a trip where I didn't have to intervene and I'm on 12. I even had what appeared to be a system crash the other day on the interstate. There is no way in hell I'd trust it in slushy/snowy conditions (not that the cameras could see anything then anyway). 

And that's the rub. If this is true and Tesla is really only ready for L3 in major metro areas on the coasts or in the south, is it really that superior to waymo? They effectively suffer the same issue, they are really only L3-capable in areas where they have oodles of data.

"No, driving the speed limit doesn’t increase your chances of getting in an accident per se but driving slower than the flow of traffic certainly does. 

They allow the car to drive over the speed limit because it’s safer for it to drive like a real person than follow arbitrary hard rules. Tesla knows the math. They know that whenever you pass someone or someone passes you the probability of an accident increases. 

Let’s create a model thought problem. Say we built a computer program where you had 3 cars in a row. Each one of these cars keeps the same distance from each other and matches each others speed 100% of the time. This computer program also allows each of these cars to move to a lane to the left or to the right without checking to see if there’s another car there. How often will there be a collision? 0% of the time because they are keeping a set speed and distance regardless of the lane they are in. The speed is arbitrary. You could be going 25mph or the speed of light it doesn’t matter. The chances are still 0%. 

Now let’s change the experiment. Let’s say that we have the same computer program except every time the car that is in last place it has to increase its speed and pass the other 2 cars to get to spot 1. Now let’s keep the same parameters as before where each car can change its lane without checking if there is another car in the lane next to it. Now how many collisions are we going to have? The chances of a collision are now much greater because now there is a higher probability of a car being in the lane next to you. 

Point being if you allow yourself to only go the speed limit when traffic is going faster you are increasing your likelihood of being in an accident due to a higher probability of a car either coming into your lane or you changing lanes into theirs. In fact if all cars matched their speed and distance and never had to pass one another there would be no need to have a speed limit.",teslamotors

I had a 2018 M3LR and that fuckin' thing was slightly louder and harsher ride than my 2012 prius II. The new M3 is a wonderful upgrade coming from pre 2021 model 3.

If you need a model Y this year though, and you qualify for tax credit, I'd get one before end of month from existing inventory with intent to use that as leverage to upgrade to new model Y. $7500 will eat a lot of depreciation and you'll probably end up only paying a couple grand or so to drive the current model Y until you upgrade.

"R2 is narrower and shorter than MY but slightly taller. I expect it’ll have slightly more usable storage space than MY, but given the R1S’s fairly harsh ride, and given the strides Tesla has made with the latest Model Y suspension improvements, I’m not confident R2 will be more comfortable than the current MY. With the much more dramatic suspension improvements with Highland Model 3 vs pre-Highland, if MY gets a similar refresh (Juniper) by the time R2 starts shipping, I’m going to go ahead and say MY will comfortably be the better option by most metrics for most potential buyers. 

And that’s all before we get into margins and manufacturing cost and production numbers. Tesla could cut the price of MY today to substantially below what the R2 will start at and still make higher than industry standard margins while R2 will likely be a loss leader for Rivian while they struggle to make profit on any of their vehicles. Their path to profitability is extremely difficult. But price cuts won’t be necessary for Tesla with Rivian’s very low production numbers by comparison. Rivian’s lofty total production target for a year after R2 production starts is roughly 1/10th what Tesla will produce this year, and as always, Tesla will continue to ramp. 

Competition is great and gives us all better options, but we’re many years from Tesla having real competitors making compelling EVs profitably at anywhere near Tesla’s production numbers. As for Tesla buyers not sticking with the brand? That’s just not what the brand loyalty figures suggest no matter how you cut it. ",teslamotors

"> If I need to increase my speed so I don’t get into a collision with another car, deer, person you are allowed to do so.

It is almost never the case though that speeding up would help in those situations. If anything, you’d hit the car/deer/person with even higher speed, resulting in a more severe accident. It’s a very bad habit to get into – the very first instinct in those situations should be an emergency stop, full force on brake pedal, not the accelerator.

">wider tires

the sidewall doesn't have to do with the tire width.  The stiffer sidewall is true, but, in the case of the uberturbines, that is at the expense of a higher moment of inertia (larger wheel).  Its a compromise, and when it comes to track performance, usually guys go 19""s instead of 20"".  So it seems if you solely care about performance, the tradeoff of having a slightly smaller wheel and slightly larger sidewall is worth it.  

But lets be honest, the reason the 20"" wheels exist is to differentiate it from the other base and LR models.  Its more of a status symbol, and its function is mostly appearance.  If Tesla truly cared about performance, they'd offer a sticky summer tier on a 19"" wheel, heck even an 18"" wheel, but they wont, because the performance trim is the most expensive and it needs to visually show that.",teslamotors

"I received 12.3 in Michigan on my 2022 M3 yesterday. Some items that I’ve noticed:

1. It would always slam on the brakes for the Michigan left on the opposite side of the road even though I am just passing it. It now goes straight past it without hesitation. Good. 

2. It would always slow down for a second green light if going through an area with many right in a row. Now it doesn’t slow down as long as they’re all green. Good. 

3. On average mode, it used to pass on the freeway if someone was going 1mph slower in front of me. It now waits until about 3mph slower than me. Good?

4. It used to slow down for turns onto side streets to about half the street speed, then use its turn signal. Now it uses the turn signal a few seconds before it begins to slow down. A little too soon for my taste, but better than the alternative. Good. 

5. It used to drive in the center of unmarked neighborhood roads. Now it hugs the right side of the road. Good assuming it isn’t trash day. 

6. Overall smoothness of the steering wheel is infinitely better. I haven’t had it jerk the steering wheel a single time over a few hundred miles.

7. It still goes to the center of 4 way stop intersections before turning. Bad and confusing to other drivers.

"* 2018 Performance Model 3 with PUP.

* They really need to add in Intermittent wipe with some user selectable variable speed between OFF and Speed 1

* Wifi is set to remain connected in drive for all known/saved SSIDs (Home and phone hotspot). The issue is, when I leave my home I need to wait to enable my iphone hotspot till I get one house away from my home and then enable the phone hotspot. The car can't figure out to switch to my phone hotspot as a ""priority"" over the home signal. The next wifi issue is, once I leave home and arrive at costco... I'll walk away from the car and now I am not in hotspot range... so it will SHUT OFF the wifi instead of keep it on. Once I enter the car it won't sync up with the iphone hotspot right away and by the time I have it in drive the car hotspot is already set to OFF. They really need to move that Wifi On/Off toggle to the ""media"" card which tells you to pay for a premium data plan.

Lots of low hanging fruit which could easily be solved on a computer on wheels, the platform was released in 2017 and it is 2024 now... they had plenty of time to knock out these quick/easy wins

* Tesla doesn't have an ambient light sensor, it has a camera which it uses to cross it's fingers and guess. But those same cameras don't always work well. So they always default to ""Please fire the headlights, until we can eventually figure out that it is not needed"" and this false positive event happens at every session you put the car into Drive or press the brake pedal just before putting the car into drive. The very first time I ever saw an ambient light sensor was around 1994/1995 with a top of the line viper alarm install. It was a very simple dome shaped sensor with a couple wires that was tossed onto the front dash. I'm pretty sure if I was to go on Alibaba... I could probably order it for 10 cents a piece (maybe even less) if I did a bulk order of 1M units. This simple sensor would save millions on engineering time!

Turns out Teslas are… just cars. Subject to the same rules and whims as the rest of the automotive market. The only thing that makes Tesla depreciation particularly noteworthy is the fact that the company claimed its products would be immune to those market factors.

- On my residential street with a 35mph limit, it refused to go over 25. 
- Hard braked and came to nearly a stop twice for absolutely no reason on an empty residential street.
- Drove over a double yellow line in a turn halfway into the oncoming lane. Had to yank it back into my lane. Line was a bit faded, but clearly visible.

In general it seems overly cautious on many residential streets to the point of not being usable (it drives at 25mph for no reason). Then it will suddenly get very aggressive/confident also for no reason - like when it took a curve in the road by driving straight over a double yellow into the oncoming lane.

I’m sure they’ll put out patches, but I found it rather dangerous. Certainly much less predictable than v11, which is rather scary.

The turn taking at stops is also very twitchy. You’re never sure when it’s going to go, and it does not inspire confidence. At least once it asserted when it should not have and I had to intervene. Unprotected lefts/rights from minor to major streets was also hairy, had to intervene at least once or I would have gotten into a collision.

"They allow the car to drive over the speed limit because it’s safer for it to drive like a real person than follow arbitrary hard rules. Tesla knows the math. They know that whenever you pass someone or someone passes you the probability of an accident increases. 

Let’s create a model thought problem. Say we built a computer program where you had 3 cars in a row. Each one of these cars keeps the same distance from each other and matches each others speed 100% of the time. This computer program also allows each of these cars to move to a lane to the left or to the right without checking to see if there’s another car there. How often will there be a collision? 0% of the time because they are keeping a set speed and distance regardless of the lane they are in. 

Now let’s change the experiment. Let’s say that we have the same computer program except every time the car that is in last place it  has to increase its speed and pass the other 2 cars to get to spot 1. Now let’s keep the same parameters as before where each car can change its lane without checking if there is another car in the lane next to it. Now how many collisions are we going to have? The chances of a collision are now much greater because now there is a higher probability of a car being in the lane next to you. 

Point being if you allow yourself to only go the speed limit when traffic is going faster you are increasing your likelihood of being in an accident due to a higher probability of a car either coming into your lane or you changing lanes into theirs. In fact if all cars matched their speed and distance and never had to pass one another there would be no need to have a speed limit.",teslamotors

It usually eventually gets to a decent to good park job, just in an order of magnitude more time than it takes me.

I have no confidence this will work well or that I'll get to the point where I feel like I can walk away from it, but this is a useful direction to go in at least.

Normal auto park that exists today best case scenario lets me...pick my nose real fast while it parks? Read a single text message? Flail my arms around like a wacky waving inflatable arms flailing tube man? None of that is really useful to me. For someone less confident with parking I guess it usefully can parallel park better than a lot of people.

Driving to the front of a lot and telling the car to go park over there and leaving immediately should have come before summon even. It's meaningfully a time-saver, and, importantly, all the time the car wastes with its lack of confidence is *time that the car is not being actively waited for*. When you summon and the car is being indecisive, its your time its wasting. When you auto-park and the car is making a 9 point turn to get into the space, your time is wasted. When I drive to work and tell the car to go park itself it can spend 30 minutes for all I care finding and getting into a spot and I won't have to care (beyond any excessive battery power it wastes) because that's not 30 minutes of me waiting for my car to figure its shit out. </rant>",teslamotors

If the naysayers were correct and the Chevy Bolt, Mustang Mach-E, Audi E-tron, or a number of other Tesla killers were actually successful, Tesla would have been required to actually shift to the Semi and Roadster to survive.

So as it was uncertain that Plan A would be successful, they flashed Plan B, then Plan A started to be a huge success.  What you witnessed was a strategic delay.  Tesla could’ve feared being called a liar and pushed out the Semi and Roadster, but now they are in a position to be able to pay all the money back with interest if they needed instead of potentially not existing.",teslamotors
"The long term solution is for all vehicle to adopt the NACS Standard AND for the charge port to be on the driver rear, or passenger front corner of the vehicle.  Right now we have a mix of locations on different vehicles which results in spots being blocked or charging cables having to be much longer than necessary to reach every vehicle.  The longer the charging cable the higher the cost and also the more like it is to fail, get run over or be damaged.

Nearly all manufacturers in North America will be on NACS by 2025 so there will be a limited set of vehicles with inconvenient charge port locations.  Unless manufacturers have included legacy vehicle support in their agreement to switch to NACS it is possible that Tesla will simply drop support for those vehicles in the future due to them blocking two supercharger spots.  A mid-term solution would be to put a few supercharger stalls with Magic Docks that have additional spacing or pass-through parking to accommodate more vehicle types.

As soon as EA, Chargepoint, EVGO, etc. switch to J3400 the CCS Standard will become like CHAdeMo and eventually CCS vehicles will just carry a J3400 to CCS adapter for DC Fast Charge access.  Unless the vehicle has the required contractors, owners will need a separate J3400 to J1772 adapter to charge at Tesla Wall connectors (e.g. a Teslatap).

A decade or two from now nearly every EV on the road will be on the same charging standard and charging stations will be much more widespread and hopefully more reliable.  Fairly soon there will be a need for a waitlist function in the app that tells you which spot to charge at.  The app should be smart enough to figure out where to place F150s and Rivians so they block the minimum number of charging spots.",teslamotors

What matters is the NET new price, not just the listed new price.  


Obviously if someone pays 36k then gets $7,500 back, no one in their right mind would pay $31k for it, even if it's a day old used.  Doesn't mean it LOST $7,500 in value instantly...it's just that the tax incentives and whatnot are driving down the used prices by an equal amount.",teslamotors

It really makes it feel like a plane where I can apply some downward pressure on the right side and it’s enough to turn and change lanes smoothly without being too fast or too slow. Feels balanced when you have both hand resting on each antler countering each other out. 

My gripes are when you have to steer lock to lock and the hand over hand method feels awkward when you’re unwinding and straightening from a turn. But cruising on sweeping roads and highways feels super good and spaceship like.

"Every proposal that resorts to governmental coercion as a solution embodies an authoritarian element. Individuals often justify certain authoritarian measures based on their underlying motives. The rationale of ""needing to act"" to do good often overshadows the uncertainty of outcomes, with some valuing the attempt over the actual impact of such interventions.

This approach frequently results in unintended consequences and perverse incentives that exacerbate rather than alleviate the original issue. A prime example are the CAFE standards for trucks, which inadvertently discourages or makes impossible the production of smaller trucks without being subject to penalties, driving up the costs of the vehicle. See the Ford Maverick. These regulations push manufacturers towards building larger trucks to accommodate the bigger engines required for handling substantial workloads for real work.",teslamotors

"While the data definitely supports the statement made in the headline, I think the main reason for this is because of Tesla cutting the prices suddenly and dramatically, not necessarily due to something inherent about Tesla vehicles themselves.

When you drop the price of a new Model S by $10,000 as an example, that immediately drops the resale value of used Model Ss by *at least* $10,000.

It makes me wonder what the depreciation is/would be if we controlled for Tesla's price cuts.",teslamotors
"Is that a typo, or did you have to pay around 13.8% Sales Tax?

Even though you have to pay tax and it IS an actual out of pocket cost to you, you really can't include that in consideration of vehicle value depreciation.  If you did that you'd have to add sales tax $ to the value of your trade in price or private sale price (even though you don't get that money).

That said, Tesla resale has definitely dropped more than most cars because of the large price reductions on new Tesla vehicles, beside the impact of rebates.",teslamotors

"I queried Copilot (in MS Edge) to see what it would return... (Sadly, nothing conclusive!)

**You:** The ""highland"" refers to the refreshed Model 3, with main updates being improved aerodynamics, and has been used in many official Tesla annoucements. As Elon Musk like to use movie references (e.g. 'Plaid' from Spaceballs), maybe ""highland"" comes from one... Alternatively, try searching for ""re-egineered Model 3"", instead?

**Copilot:** Thank you for providing additional context! It’s fascinating how Elon Musk often draws inspiration from various sources, including movies, for naming Tesla features and versions. While I don’t have definitive information on the origin of the term “Highland” specifically for the refreshed Model 3, let’s explore some possibilities:

1. **Movie Reference**: Given Musk’s penchant for movie references (such as “Plaid” from Spaceballs), it’s entirely plausible that “Highland” could be a subtle nod to a film or pop culture. Unfortunately, without specific confirmation, we can only speculate.
2. **Geographical Connection**: The term “Highland” is commonly associated with elevated regions, such as the Scottish Highlands. Perhaps Tesla chose this name to emphasize the improved performance or elevated status of the refreshed Model 3.
3. **Aerodynamics and Efficiency**: Considering the main updates are related to improved aerodynamics, the name “Highland” might evoke thoughts of soaring heights, efficiency, and reduced drag—qualities often associated with high-altitude environments.
4. **Re-engineered Model 3**: As you suggested, searching for “re-engineered Model 3” might yield more insights. Let’s explore that angle.

I appreciate your curiosity, and while we can’t pinpoint the exact source, the mystery behind “Highland” adds an air of intrigue to Tesla’s naming conventions!

I explained to the CS that this deal is contingent upon the trade-in and that changing the trade-in value by such a large amount is tantamount to a material contract change. They shrugged and were like ""well if you want to cancel, we keep your $500 online fee"".

For a track car, the performance was under braked, as using it as a track car means, turning of regenerative braking (as it over heated the battery pack and everything else). The performance brakes were too thin, and didn't really work well with regenerative braking off. 

Upgrading the front brakes (375mm), providing more cooling for the battery pack and motors, slightly firmer suspension, would help a lot. On some tracks that would easily make 5-10 seconds faster, and make it a more enjoyable car to drive. 

 Sportier seats, sportier interior trim, and a unique performance colour would go a long, long way to make it more identifiable and enjoyable and unique ownership experience.",teslamotors

Neither are the case in a road car. As I mentioned, wouldn’t be as much of an issue if they implemented steer-by-wire in the lineup, that would make it one-turn lock-lock just like a racecar

Same issue with the yoke, don’t need to do hand-over-hand in a racer, you need it in a road car.

""Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) and Tesla are working on faster battery charging technology. The CATL CEO has confirmed the collaboration and also said the company is supplying battery production equipment to Giga Nevada.


Robin Zeng, founder and CEO of CATL, commented on the $25,000 electric car that Tesla plans to start producing in the coming years. “There’s always room for cost reduction depending on what the $25,000 car’s aim is,” said Zeng, in an interview with Bloomberg. “If it’s for robotaxis, we don’t have to worry about the cost reduction for each cell as our batteries have a longer life cycle and so their average cost is actually lower.”

He said the companies are working together on battery technologies. In particular, collaboration is taking place on new electrochemical structures that will enable faster charging.

In addition, Zeng also confirmed that CATL is supplying equipment to Tesla’s Nevada factory. At the beginning of February, it became known that the Chinese giant would provide equipment to the factory of the Texas manufacturer for the production of Megapack. Tesla will start this factory with an initial capacity of about 10 gigawatt-hours (GWh), with expansion plans dependent on the project’s success, the sources said.

In addition to its largest customer, Tesla, CATL also serves automakers such as BMW AG, Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and Nio Inc. The company offers low-cost but reliable lithium iron phosphate batteries. However, CATL is effectively prohibited from selling products directly in the US. The company is trying to get around this by licensing battery technology to partners with a royalty fee.

Zeng expressed optimism about this licensing model. He added that the company plans to train engineers from automakers. At the moment, such an agreement already exists with Ford, and CATL is negotiating with about 10-20 other automakers in the US and Europe regarding a similar agreement, he said.

“Geopolitics is very complicated for us business managers but what matters most is client trust that transcends short-term governments and political disturbances,” said Zeng. “Actions speak louder than words.”""",teslamotors

The stock plan was also contingent on delivering stock performance, which meant Elon only gets stock AFTER the stock performs to agreement, which is AFTER the employees get upside on their stock options.

The lawsuit was brought by a guy with 4 shares, on behalf of a predatory group of law firms, arguing shareholders were not properly informed, the board is controlled by execs yada yada. It's a garbage argument because:1) it's very difficult for true exec/board separation in relatively young companies where the execs are early employees, see Meta's case where Zuck can functionally overrule the board unilaterally 2), the plaintiff is arguing an incentive to someone for increasing the PLAINTIFFS profit was unfairly informed.",teslamotors

Electrify America has actually been spawned off onto its own thing.  Volkswagen used to own them, but not anymore, they're their own entity.

I don't disagree that Electrify America needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, and to be fair, their CEO did an electric road trip recently and kind of acknowledged the issues, so they're working on it, but Tesla is just way ahead of the game.

You can see companies like EVGo looking at Tesla and trying to catch up, as they're also working on pre-fab chargers to deploy as quickly as Tesla does, but Tesla is just faster at it in the long run.

In the long run, I see more companies, like BP, who will opt to buy Tesla's v4 chargers and relabel them as theirs.  Tesla will become a charging equipment manufacturer for others, and themselves.  I would not be shocked to see some v4 superchargers branded as Ford down the road.",teslamotors

"I've had this happen a few times recently. It was daytime with good weather in each case. Definitely worse lately than a year ago. I tightly grip the wheel at any intersection or offramp these days, or for construction or faded lane lines.

Couple times, there was an offramp to the right, but the road was also curving to the left. The car started pulling out into the offramp. I did nothing at first, expecting it to correct itself. Instead it gave me the red hands of death with a ""take over immediately"" warning. (Which I did without incident.)

More scary was when I was on the 101 just north of San Francisco a couple months ago. You'd think Autopilot would operate better in that area than anywhere, since Tesla built and tested the system in the Bay Area.

"One measures distance using sound. Once captures light. Light is not distance. 

That light capture then has to get processed through a computer with neural nets to determine an estimated distance to various objects. 

The former simply measures distance of things that return an ultrasonic return which works pretty well in most cases. 

The latter can in theory work better given that it might see objects that an ultrasound sensor would not. It may also miss objects that don't match its training, or struggle in different lighting conditions. Humans eyes generally have much better dynamic range than cameras do. And humans use stereo vision to help with this, and Tesla doesn't do that either. 

They may eventually get equivalent or better results out of the camera + processing system, but it is a much more complex problem than a sensor that gives you a pretty reliable distance measurement.",teslamotors

"This was in response to why no 360 cam and every other complaint about Tesla. Decided to post in main thread.

It boils down to first principles.

Tesla decided to start from scratch on almost everything. It's their first principles and starts with, what is the truth? What is the truth of the purpose and need of this feature?  But we don't always know the truth, so you go on a truth finding mission. You ask, what is this feature supposed to do? Why do people need it? You challenge your findings for the reasons and the ways people do that it today to see if the truth is valid or was a car makers sales narrative all this time. Sometimes you even take the feature away and test to see if people ever actually needed it.

For Tesla, a lot of their first versions of a feature, their worst version of that feature, is so far ahead of the whole industry that leads people to believe they're going to crush everyone as they continue to iterate and widen the gap. Other features, the first version looks like they had their underwear on backwards. But at the end of the day, their promise is to iterate every point of the car that truly matters, and especially the things that can be solved with software. Whatever version you have today is something that will be improved many times in the future, especially the software based features.

The few valid criticisms like USS being taken away and this blind spot monitoring are already on second or third iterations. Blind spot monitoring started on your center screen and it's latest iteration includes a red dot so you can see it wherever you're looking. Seems to be going in the right direction.

Tesla vision is already on it's second iteration and has real-time environment modeling using cameras. That was pretty fast and was rolled out in 5 months. I'm actually excited to see how they improve it again. Possibly with textures or real-time photo texture mapping, so instead of a static perspective 2D 360 birds eye view, you get a 3D drone like actively rendered view that let's you swipe your perspective around on the screen.  That's probably asking for a lot on the current hardware but I actually think the right thing to do is NOT slap the same 360 cam everyone else is doing, check the box and never even try to look at it again like every other manufacturer.

They're going iteration, feedback, then iteration to eventually reach a version we didn't know could exist and would never have existed if we left it in the hands of traditional manufacturers.",teslamotors

"> it’s what, 9 digital cameras recording to a central unit.

That part is easy.  The problem is that it's not just *recording*, it's continually running the FSD AI image recognition on all those cameras.  

Doing that means you need the autopilot computer up and running in full power mode, which means you also need at least one coolant pump running.  That together is enough that you need the HV battery contactors and DC-DC converter active.  

So the result is the car is very close to 'drive' configuration, just without the drive inverters, stereo, cabin and driving 12v systems (IE power steering / airbags / ABS / USB ports / etc).  

My guess for what they're doing to fix it- rather than have the FSD computer continually running its algorithm, it'll stay mostly powered down and just feed the images to the AMD processor that'll run a basic motion detection algorithm (like a surveillance camera- just check how many pixels change by how much over the last half-second).  If motion is detected it fires up the FSD AI chip and runs image recognition on the last several seconds of video.  

Alternatively, it might be keeping the full stack active, just with less compute load- IE run the AI recognition only once a second and keep the AI processor sleeping the rest of the time.",teslamotors

It's also a misconception that it's just the integration that makes Apple Silicon good, they're just very ambitious, very wide decode, deep reorder buffer, high IPC cores, that can run at close to the best single core performance we have these days at a fraction the power because they don't lean on turbo boost.

But the damages are always just a bit right around the cost the target would have to pay to defend

So the holder sells a license and moves on

As CTO of a rising eCommerce site in 2005 that sold sporting goods, I brought in a company called Terra data to build an analytics wheelhouse for our site

Once we signed our proof of concept agreement they sued us for infringement !

What you ask ?

The electronic shopping cart 

You see - Terra data at one point was owned by national cash register (ncr) and ncr patented the electronic cart. They never did anything with it on purpose 

When they spun out Terra data they formed a joint holding company for the sole purpose of suing rising web sites with a cart.

They negotiated a deal with amazon a few years earlier, it was then around 2005, and amazon paid them around 25M to create a hazard in waiting for any competitor 

We dropped Terra data - but they had such a solid “patent pirate” operation we had to settle, Less than what they wanted - but we did

And we had our license 

I have so many more

I’ve also learned a lot of these patent trolls are hedge funds 

So my guess is that Hyundai likely negotiated licenses with every manufacturer who has an audible sound for proximity while turning

The car starts powering things down, and drops to under 90 watts about 1 minute before deep sleep when it opens the HV battery contactors.  So there's a lot of likely idle watts there to optimize. 

If they can address and optimize the other idle power consumption in the car while awake and Sentry mode is active, they can certainly make a pretty huge difference.",teslamotors

Tesla at least is honest about it and offered the same price to everyone unlike the scummy dealers who took peoples custom ordered EVs (ford lightnings) and marked them up $20k then sold them to highest offer. There are screenshots of ford dealerships sending email to 100s of people literally asking for $5k non refundable deposits and bidding the price up.,teslamotors

If we want to maintain a healthy and functioning society, we need to solve these CPAs. This can be done by authority, as is the case with the Cybertruck in Europe: It won't be road legal, because it's too dangerous for pedestrians and other road users.

But these collective action problems can also be solved through cooperation, based on human nature: If I can buy a car that's a little smaller, thus less safe for me, I'm offering a comparativley larger benefit to pedestrians, my fellow citizens.

"That again is a mistaken mindset. Self driving doesn't need the equivalent of a human brain behind it. Thinking it does is why you and Google approach the problem in a sub-optimal way. Does a car need to have an appreciation of poetry & Music to drive from A to B without incident. No, hence just one example of how the entire human brain doesn't need to fully replicate the brain. It just needs to emulate the tasks required to safely drive on roads and navigate the real world.

Using a human brain, 10ks thousands of people die each year from traffic accidents. Thus, why is it required that FSD be perfect? The goal of FSD would be to be a system very specifically tailored to driving and be better / safer at that task than humans. If FSD reduced car accidents by 50%. Its worth it to save that 50%. 

Thus, FSD isnt complete when it replicates a human brain, FSD is available once it demonstrably meets both the technical and saftey goals. Technical goal being to be level 5, no human intervention needed, and for safety, to result in less accidents than humans would.

Both of those technical and safety criteria can be evaluated quantitively.

Technical- Humber of miles driven per intervention. The higher this number, the more self driving the system is.  

Safety - Number of crashes, injuries, deaths per mile driven. The lower this number the safer the system is.

These metrics are monitored / known. The data will be eventually presented to regulators to approve systems for formal use as FSD. 

Here's a hint. FSD will be technically available years before it is approved by regulators. If you wait until a regulator has approved this tech before understanding that it exists, your going to miss out.",teslamotors

Those car companies have about a CENTURY of manufacturing and engineering experience on Tesla, surely they'll have some things first.

2) They are among the safest cars on the road (some would argue THE safest).

3) They consistently break their previous safety scores with new models.

4) This particular update (along with the new Model 3 getting a ""Car of the Year"" award from Drive and MANY rave reviews) Tesla is still innovating AND listening to customers on things like this and build quality, unlike traditional manufacturers who are still using ancient hardware to run their systems (most notably infotainment) and declining in build quality.",teslamotors

Idk ... I kind of like it? 😬

Simple doesn't mean thoughtless. It feels elegant in its simplicity. 

You already have a giant display showing you cars are in your blind spot and even exactly what kind of vehicles they are. That's far and away the highest tech blind spot indication out there. And if you're proactive it's quite good at covering blind spots. But it's not quite as discoverable / optimal in terms of your attention/awareness than a mirror based option.

But this signal feels like it *could* be as good as the mirror option. I'd have to try it to be sure. But if it does catch your eye especially earlier than a mirror even could, that could actually *improve* your response time. Just catching it in your periphery before you even bother to take your eyes off what's in front of you to look in the mirror. And it's tucked away, discrete. Speaks well to the Spartan design language in its efficient design.

And shit maybe you can retrofit with a speaker swap under the grill of existing Ys and 3s. The new speaker could have a built in LED for an optional ""upgrade"" after a software update.

"Got v12.3 today (and I'm perhaps the most non-influencer owner ever), made two short-ish drives, and had only a couple small quibbles:

* Interstate off ramp turned into a cloverleaf and car's speed near the end of that cloverleaf was slower than called for.  Traffic was closing in as I was merging, so I fed in some acceleration and it handled the lane change (two, actually, since my left turn was coming up kind of quickly) perfectly.
* Left turn at a light on to a four-lane road put me in the leftmost lane (as expected) and I had an upcoming right turn, but it stayed in the leftmost lane too long.  A quarter-mile out, with thickening traffic, I didn't think it would get over into the right lane, so I signaled and it handled everything just fine.

General: far more natural than any v11 version I've tried, signals earlier than v11 (which is great to help tailgaters slow down), and speed was a tiny bit slow (but I was in Chill, so probably going to move to Average).  Not sold on the Automatic Speed Offset; will try with and without.

I usually ask myself two rhetorical questions when I get an FSD beta update:

* Is this update better than the last version in my usual situations?
* If this was the ""final"" FSD beta version, could I live with it?

"My two issues include a few instances of your stop sign behavior but this was mostly limited to turns with bad sight lines but a far bigger problem for me is failure to maintain the set speed.   
     
I am not sure what is going on but on two lane driving it just will not maintain the set speed with instances of being down ten miles an hour at times. On a 45 set to 52 I had many cases where is was doing around 40. Now I could encourage it with a press on the accelerator and it would hold it awhile but eventually slack off. This is with very clear sight lines and even in areas where it was just straight road.    
    
Oh, I do not like that feature that lets it drive at what speed it thinks is safe. First off it speeds and not just by a little, I was doing 50 in a 35 and I kept trying to dial it back- it does seem to respond to that but does not make it clear what speed is now max. I really wish the speed offset value DID SOMETHING like apply to how fast over it was allowed to go. I need to test that on the road it would not hold to 52 on... I wonder     
    
Success stories include a very bad T intersection with crossing traffic does not stop. It finally is able to negotiate that without giving me a heart attack. It does seem to accelerate through intersections much better.  It uses turn signals.  
  
Failure, totally missed a right turn into my subdivision, navigation voiced the turn and such but the car blew past the entirety of the turn lane.    
  
Honestly the inability to maintain set speed means I absolutely cannot use with cars behind me because not only will that driving slow irritate people behind me the constant speed changes will as well.  Worse is that we are back to where it does not use map data for all roads. It keeps the speed of the previous road. So now a road I was fine on with it knowing it is 45 is now 35 or worse 25 until it sees the sign. They keep breaking this.",teslamotors

"One thing that was not mentioned in the comments yet is that apparently Tesla has been breaking wastewater limits for some time now.

Tesla did not respond to the letters from the wastewater operator. There is now a threat of the wastewater being stopped, which for Tesla means at least a temporary shutdown of production until the problem is solved. 
However, it probably does not concern industrial wastewater from production, but wastewater from kitchens, toilets, etc. Interestingly, the reason seems to be that Tesla recycles too much water and the wastewater is therefore not diluted enough. 

I wonder why Tesla let this happen. Why didn't they react sooner?

Completely unnecessary in my opinion and of course this now gives all opponents of Tesla a legitimate reason to the other, frankly very weak arguments such as forest (is being reforested) and water consumption (is very low).",teslamotors

"I think a lot of things that get removed aren't just because of cost, but because of logistics. Musk has said a bunch of times that a car has 10,000 parts, and you can only make them as fast as you can get all the parts.

That's especially true during the initial ramp up, getting your parts production and supplier deliveries all ramped up and synced up can take years to get to full capacity. And then if there's a disruption, whichever part is least lucky is what determines total production.

So when you replace stalks with buttons you go from a bunch of individual parts to a few similar parts. And buttons are probably a much easier thing to swap in from a new supplier too.

It's unlikely that your production line is going to be stopped by a missing switch that only shows up in the stalks, but it's possible. And if you reduce that kind of risk 50 times across lots of different places, it means that your volumes go up much faster and they don't fall nearly as much when there's a disruption.",teslamotors

Left-wing extremists have committed themselves to the arson attack on the electricity supply of the Brandenburg Tesla factory, which also led to power outages in the region. “Together we are bringing Tesla to its knees. Switch off for Tesla. Greetings to everyone on the run, underground in the prisons and in resistance! Love and power to all antif's!” says the detailed mail of the so-called “volcanic group”, which was received by this newspaper at 11.41. “We sabotaged Tesla today.”  
  
There is no assessment of security authorities. ""We are currently examining this,"" said Beate Kardes, spokeswoman for the state police headquarters, of this newspaper. The so-called “volcanic group” had already carried out an incendiary attack on high-voltage lines for the factory’s construction site at that time in 2021.  
  
Tesla eat earth, resources, people, workforce and spit out SUVs, killer machines and monster trucks, wrote the “Vulcan Group.” “Our gift for the 8th century. March means switching off Tesla.” It would be continued: “For the complete destruction of the Gigafactory and with it the sawing off of “Technofaschists” like Elend Musk (meaning Tesla boss Elon Musk, editor of the editors) are a step on the path of liberation from the patriarchy.”  
  
The group also calls for attacks on Tesla vehicles. “In the secret poetry album every activist should not be missed by a broken Tesla. No Tesla in the world should be more safe from our flaming rage. Every Tesla that burns sabotages the imperial way of life.”  
    
There were massive power cuts around the Tesla-Gigafactory in Grünheide on Tuesday – the factory of the US electric car manufacturer with 122,500 employees was paralysed. “The work has been evacuated,” Tesla confirmed on request. ""According to the authorities, it was an arson stop."" There was a power failure around 5 o'clock. All necessary measures were taken to secure the production plant.  
  
“If the initial findings are confirmed, it is a perfidious attack on our electricity infrastructure. That will have consequences. Here, thousands of people were cut off from basic services and put into danger,” Brandenburg said in the Interior, Michael Stübgen (CDU). ""The rule of law will react to such an act of sabotage with all its hardness. Nothing can yet be said to the perpetrators, so I warn of hasty speculations. Now we need to work concentratedly and with all its might to clarify the incident. The State Criminal Police Office has started the investigation.”  
  
Unknown perpetrators had set a high-voltage mast on fire between Steinfurt and Hartmannsdorf. Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke (SPD) demands that the Attorney General take out the investigation. “Both attacks on our critical infrastructure are a form of terrorism. It now needs a consistent crackdown on the rule of law. Should the suspicion of a terrorist attack become confirmed, the Federal Prosecutor General will have to take over the investigation,” Woidke said.  
  
After consultation with the grid operator E.Dis, Tesla expects that it will take a “a few time” until the damage can be repaired and the factory can be supplied with electricity again. The electricity also fell out in Erkner, in Grünheide and the surrounding area and parts of the south-east of Berlin. The freebrinck industrial estate, where Edeka operates a distribution warehouse for Berlin, Brandenburg and other regions in East Germany, is also affected.  
    
As a result of the damage, there were rests in outdoor drinking, Erkner, Neu Zittau, Dahlwitz-Hoppegarten, Neuenhagen, Woltersdorf, Schöneiche and Gosen, among others. “Due to immediate switching measures initiated by the E.DIS network experts, the supply default could be limited in the meantime,” said Fox. Due to the now ongoing investigation by the police, ""no further information"" is possible.  
  
“We start from arson. We are investigating in all directions,” said a spokeswoman for the East Police Directorate on Tuesday morning. “The mission is running”. Further information cannot be provided at this point in time. The police confirmed the fire of a plant in the grid operator E.DIS in the Tesla region. “There was a burning power pole in the district of Gosen/Neuzittau,” it said. The fire, which was reported at 5.15 a.m., has now been deleted. The fire of the mast, which is freely standing in a field, has been damaged by a high-voltage overland cable, it was said. After the fire alarm in the morning, a police helicopter was in use.  
   
“In civil protection circles of the Märkisch-Oderland districts, there was initially talk of a ""fire stop on a transformer station"".
  
According to information from MAZ and BZ, there was also a police operation on suspicion of ordnance. A tent is said to have been found near the fire with the warning: ""Fighting product here is pudding"". Therefore, the area is searched for bombs. The ammunition recovery service of the Brandenburg police, moved up from Wünsdorf, is to be in service. E.Dis announced information on request, “As soon as secure information is available.”   
   
Not far from the factory and the site of the arson attack is located at five, six kilometres away - in between the Spree flows - a protest camp of 80 to 100 climate activists from all over Germany against the Tesla factory had been flowing in between - for a few days near Fangschleuse station. They have built ten tree houses at several metres. The country of Brandenburg is owned by the forest. They are protesting against expansion plans for the factory of the electric car builder and the ""dirty e-mobility"". The forest occupation is supported by the Citizens' Initiative Grünheide. On the site, Tesla wants to increase its existing plant by 118 hectares, especially for a freight yard, for which the forest is to be largely cleared.   
   
“We don’t know more than others. We didn’t notice anything of the fire,” said Lotta Neyman, spokeswoman for the protest camp. Until now, communication with the police has been good. This had inquired about the arson attack among the activists, but searches or the like would not have taken place. “On the one hand, we are worried that there are negative consequences for our protest. On the other hand, we are happy to pay every attention to our concern,” said the 20-year-old student. Basically, the activists are confident that this will be up to the 15th anniversary of the sight. March tolerated camp may continue to exist afterwards.",teslamotors

They should have the app do a stall reservation system.  Many sites have or should have a surveillance camera for app to monitor stall usage and obstructions.  Using their super computer AI skills, if you are on the way to a charger, it should schedule your car for a 3 minute arrival window a specific charger stall.  It could optimize so other brands get stalls on the right side of the site and cars with back left or front right ports get prioritized for the other side.  If congested it can make a virtual queue so people do not cut in line and could conceivably wait in a safer spot than lined up blocking laneway plus optimize stalls for the car carger configuration.

If you do not plug in during your arrival slot you get app notice asking if there is issues.  No response and you loose your spot, reply with ""need more time to park, charger issue, etc to extend your timeslot"" abuse the reservation and you loose ability to extend in future.  Abuse it by not showing up multiple times and you get shorter windows or loose access to queues on busy sites.  If charger reports broken they could ask you to try another stall and if multiple people have issues with same stall pull it out of the queue and use it as a free space for cars needing to park on right side of adjacent charger.",teslamotors

So he uncritically bought into the wasteful fad for oversized vehicles (which was somewhat ironically largely kicked off by looser regulations in the 1970s - and could just as easily be reversed).

Partly redeemed by being both an engineering testbed and a way to change perceptions of a steel body in preparation for the Model 2?

For example, I did a 200 mile trip, 190 of which was on FSD.   In the 10 miles not FSD miles, I had a hard breaking.  

While, as Tesla says, the trip included the “miles driven on autopilot,” those miles are “not factored into the “Safety Score Beta Formula.”

As a result, I received a score as if I had driven 10 miles and had a hard braking during those 10 miles.  The trip showed the entire 200 miles.  So I received something like a 92% for the entire drive, because, as Tesla specifically says, those FSD miles are
not factored into the safety score.  

This is easy to replicate.  Pick a day, do a hard stop” and then use autopilot or FSD for the rest of the trip.  You will see that my I interpretation of Tesla’s language is how they apply it.

I like gas and electric in their own ways to be honest. GTR is a hard-core performance vehicle, very loud, rough and not refined or built with much quality compared to other vehicles now days

Problem with the tesla is that lower battery, battery degradation, temperature drop, will all have a drop in 1/4 mile time and probably a significant amount. Bmw is consistent 10 second car stock period. So electric needs to be on the faster side IMHO to hold its own better.

The Tesla has it built into the car, which actively monitors everything and will update your route accordingly.

BYD will gain huge market because of price, but don’t underestimate the convenience of the Tesla navigation. Many people will not mind to pay a bit more for convenience.

">You consider the current cybertruck 'rollout' a success?... 

When has Tesla unveiled an entirely new platform and immediately ramped to full production at the lowest price possible? Again, every detractor called it vaporware that would never be delivered, and now that it’s being delivered, you have to find something new to bitch about. Or do you still think the current deliveries are CGI? Must be exhausting. 

>The thing is 40k more than originally advertised and gimped vs original specs lol. 

Ah yes taking advantage of gigantic demand with a temporarily increased price somehow makes it a gigantic failure. They have FAR more customers willing to execute at this price than production capacity, so of course they’ll charge more. They’ve done this for almost every new platform release. My M3P+ was $77k in 2018 and costs $20k less now. I paid an early adopter fee to get mine sooner. And calling an extra 40 miles of range and significantly more towing capacity on the most popular, most reserved spec “gimped vs original specs” is funny. Only the Cyberbeast missed initial range expectations, and the platform gained 48v architecture, rear wheel steering, steer-by-wire, and V2H. Range extender reduces the bed size to that of the R1T’s bed and increases range almost 40%, extending range far beyond what the AWD was announced at and missing the top spec by 30 miles, but just like every other tslaq, I’m sure you don’t believe it’ll ever be delivered. 

>Have you seen how poorly the model s/x sell?

Competitively with other vehicles in their classes and price ranges? I wouldn’t call that poor lol but ok. Halo effect of the Plaid also absolutely sells more 3s and Ys. 

>Prices only just recently came down from 70k to 40k on model Ys, and you are arguably getting less than what you got 3 years ago if you bought.

Comparing peak LR prices during COVID to SR prices today and saying you get less in a lower price tier model without mentioning that. Neat. Not disingenuous at all. Still making higher margin at 40k than any other automaker anywhere near its price range, and far more than any other automaker makes on any EV. Best selling vehicle in the world and you’re implying it’s a commercial failure.

>You can't be that far up Teslas ass lol. Tesla is full of empty promises.

"From the article: In version 2.0 Tesla updated the metric to take into account how much time you spent driving in each hour between 10pm and 4am, resulting in more of a negative impact on your Safety Score the later in the night you were driving.

Despite this change, there was still a lot of criticism that the 10pm start time for Late Night Driving was too early, resulting in customers paying higher premiums. Tesla has heard this feedback and pushed back the start time to 11pm with the release of version 2.1, according to the Safety Score page on Tesla’s website.

“Updated Late-Night Driving to be risk weighted based on driving from 11 PM – 4 AM (previously 10 PM to 4 AM). The impact of late-night driving on your Safety Score will depend on the proportion of time spent driving in each hour from 11 PM – 4 AM.”

Tesla says this is the only key change with the release of version 2.1. Unfortunately there has been no change to probably the most controversial metric, Forward Collision Warnings.",teslamotors

"Two million people reserved a truck that is less than half the price of the cheapest current truck they sell…
People will get excited over a Ferrari but you are not going to see every family own one. The fact of the matter is that the price jumps ended up putting it way out of the non-Tesla fan truck buyer bell curve. 

The Model Y is Tesla’s best selling car. The Model X, which is a similar price jump as the cybertruck now vs announcement, sells less than 1/30th the numbers. 1/30th, a bonkers number. 

Nobody here really understands that most truck buyers are buying cars they can barely afford as it exists. You jump that $20k and you have 90% less sales. 

Might I add, the cheapest base model will probably never exist for two reasons: 

1. The price cut for a non-foundation RWD from the current AWD is $40k…that battery and motor are like $5k max in cost. The margin is likely not there currently.

Teslas focus on reducing material costs and streamlining production is part of the reason Teslas are notorious for their shitty build quality and probably the reason they're losing so much market share to BYD in China.

Later with projected LEDs and then with matrix (pixels). Are you in doubt that Tesla doesn't know how to do it? They work very well and fast. From the opposite perspective it might look like a little brighter than usual headlights approaching you but they are not glaring. I've driven with lights like this for almost 10 years (vw passat with dynamic light assist, MY2015). They're just great. Matrix is the same tech but less moving parts since the lighting is controlled by turning on/off individual pixels. Just got them on my 2021 model 3.

For the OP, the large masked area around car is probably just to make sure, because you can adjust your headlight's alignment by yourself from the service menu, and people can have all kinds of different alignments that +/- some from the sweet spot.  Just my 10 cents, I bet the car doesn't know exactly how the headlights are aligned compared to the camera calibration etc. so there needs to be some headroom/clearance there.

It's also 40% more money than the current m3p once you equip it with options like most people do. 

A quick look at the 5-60mph times also shows that while still fast, it's not quite as fast as the 1/4 mile times suggest, a base m3 was like 4.2sec 5-60mph which is still fast, but it's no faster than a f150 lightning in the same benchmark.

Tesla's built in navigation is great at planning charging stops and required for FSD to change lanes and make turns appropriately. The navigation system needs to know the vehicle efficiency, state of charge, temperatures, etc in order to effectively plan charging stops.

He said Tesla was among the automakers with whom the government held talks regarding efforts to increase car production in Italy.

“We have had conversations with producers from several countries, not just eastern ones, but western ones too,” Urso told the Lower House’s industry committee amid reported interest from Chinese maker BYD in making vehicles in Italy, according to ANSA.

In his opinion, tensions in connection with Tesla’s development in Germany may become a reason for a more decisive position of the company and its desire for further negotiations with Italy.

“A German city rejected a plan for the large-scale expansion of Tesla’s European assembly plant,” the minister said, referring to Brandenburg. “This will certainly lead to a decision by the group,” he added.",teslamotors

When the Model 3 and Y launched in China there were social media influencers making fake videos, lying, disparaging Tesla. Those people were found guilty of what I assume is the Chinese equivalent of defamation, made to pay fines, and apologize publicly. 

At the time, someone had apparently found a connection between one such person and a rival EV car company. I’m going from memory here, but I think it may have been the lady who jumped on the roof of a Tesla at a convention worked for NIO or something.

Today you have so called “environmental activists” protesting against the Berlin factory because they say it consumes too much water and the carbon footprint for EVs is larger than ICE cars.

Bullshit. Neither of those is true. Tesla is one of the smallest water consumers in the area. There’s a coal mine in the region that uses 170x more water. A nearby asparagus farm uses twice as much. And Tesla recycles 100% of their water. EVs also have a much smaller lifetime carbon footprint than has cars. 

These protesters are not environmental activists, they’re probably being paid by someone to sabotage Tesla in any way they can. The only two obvious suspoarw short sellers and competing car companies. Paying people tens of thousands of dollars cash to “protest” Tesla would be trivial to do. There’s no way people can be this stupid.",teslamotors
"The thing is normal teslas are renowned for NOT going down. Really the primary thing that will lead to sinking is water ingress but there is more than enough air, and not enough gigantic metal box known as an engine to force the front down which is the real problem for normal vehicles. 

Since the weight is far more evenly distributed it keeps the vehicle windows above the ground for far longer and does slow down water ingress by keeping ways of entry (such as aerations and the various interfaces) higher.

A youtuber already did the experiment with the plaid, which isn't light by any stretch. He needed to overload the vehicle to a comical degree to get it to fully submerge. Even if it does not reach the levels of accidental flotation as the model 3, it still remains a very good or at least average case.",teslamotors

At the time he said V12 wouldn't be beta, they were already testing early beta versions of V12 internally, and obviously he knew those weren't good enough to not be considered beta (otherwise he would've just released it back then).

If Hertz bought a bunch of combustion cars, they would not have paid inflated dealer pricing and the manufacturer can't artificially raise the prices because dealers would have put a stop to it.

"There are plenty of incidents where roads, signs, markings, or lines are not properly maintained or even the same quality between locations by state/local authorities.  The request of NHTSA is to comply with the law in all scenarios even when the government is upholding its responsibility.  

Humans can and do make decisions based on poor data - even FSD can as it is trained based on human data.  NHTSA says ""fuck the data follow the law to the letter"".  As others have pointed out this causes safety issues when a driver acts unexpectedly.  The laws exist to keep people safe who use them, but there is a culture of normalcy of deviance around laws in that in practice not all laws are followed to the letter.

Is there a person alive who hasn't gone over the strict number of the speed limit?  What if you come over a hill and below the crest with no warning the speed limit changes from 65 to 40.  Typically there are speed change ahead warnings, but I just went on a ride on my bike yesterday and that exact thing happened.

By NHTSA logic Tesla should stomp on the brakes to follow the letter of the law - something that will cause a car accident.

Now, this isn't to say that people break the road laws being unsafe, driving 120mph in a residential zone is asking for someone to be killed yet this isn't the complaint.  The law is a standard but there is variation in that standard as normal operating procedure.  We don't see police (unless they are directed by the politicians to make the government money through tickets) pulling over every single infraction, there wouldn't be enough police and the ROI for tax dollars to safety improvement is not there.

"> put it on the wrong side

There is no right side.

Put it on the front? Ices up in winter.

Put it on the driver's side fender? Can cause contention with the driver's door depending on your garage layout. Requires nose-in parking at perpendicular charging stations, which is more dangerous than backing in.

Front passenger side? More convenient for curbside charging, worse for pretty much everything else. Still encourages charging stall designs that have you pull in nose first.
 
Rear passenger side? See front passenger side, except now back-in charging makes more sense, which is good, but you have to walk around the front after you plug in because the cord is in the way of getting back to the driver's seat.

Rear driver side? Reasonable compromise: gets people to do the safer action of backing in for high speed charging, doesn't ice up, convenient for many charging situations. Inconvenient for curbside charging.

Personally I think the Tesla compromise is the least-bad choice from the set. Front driver's side isn't half bad either. Dead center front and rear passenger side have been my least favorite. I haven't owned a car with a front passenger side port.

The best solution is probably to do what Tesla did, but then add an AC-only port on the rear passenger side. Similar to what Audi does. Then you're in great shape for L3 charging, and curbside L2 still works well.",teslamotors

And the speed on the Autobahn is far from “pacing traffic”. You have trucks going 80 km/h, grandmas going 100 km/h, “normal” drivers going 120 km/h to 130 km/h, fast drivers at ~160 km/h, and “racers” going 200+.

Are you a new tech user?


Literally the entire gaming industry, and most software industries. The only difference is since their software isnt literally life or death, they can remove the “beta” word and pretend it’s a finished product.

The entire software industry these days runs on an Agile development framework. There’s a reason the word “MVP” exists, which is “minimally viable product”. The entire point is to deliver as soon as possible to make money first no matter the lack of features, then add the meat and potatoes through future updates.",teslamotors
"My essay written on phone. It boils down to first principles.

They decided to start from scratch on almost everything. It's their first principles and starts with, what is the truth? What is the truth of the purpose and need of this feature?  But we don't always know the truth, so you to on a truth finding mission. You ask, what is this feature supposed to do? Why do people need it? You challenge your findings for the reason and the way people do it today to see if the truth is valid. Sometimes you even take the feature away and test to see if people ever actually needed it.

For Tesla, a lot of their first versions of a feature, their worst version of that feature, is so far ahead of the whole industry that leads people to believe they're going to crush everyone as they continue to iterate and widen the gap. Other features, the first version looks like they had their underwear on backwards. But at the end of the day, their promise is to iterate every point of the car that truly matters, and especially the things that can be solved with software. Whatever version you have today is something that will be improved many times in the future, especially the software based features.

The few valid criticisms like USS being taken away and this blind spot monitoring are already on second or third iterations. Blind spot monitoring started on your center screen and it's latest iteration includes a red dot so you can see it wherever you're looking. Seems to be going in the right direction.

Tesla vision is already on it's second iteration and has real-time environment modeling using cameras. That was pretty fast and was rolled out in 5 months. I'm actually excited to see how they improve it again. Possibly with textures or real-time photo texture mapping, so instead of a static perspective 2D 360 birds eye view, you get a 3D drone like actively rendered view that let's you swipe your perspective around on the screen.  That's probably asking for a lot on the current hardware but I actually think the right thing to do is NOT slap the same 360 cam everyone else is doing, check the box and never even try to look at it again like every other manufacturer.

They're going iteration, feedback, then iteration to eventually reach a version we didn't know could exist and would never have existed if we left it in the hands of traditional manufacturers.",teslamotors

On the flipside, I'd like to see some comprehensive data showing the automation is MORE unsafe than a person - even if its just limited circumstances like lane/speed keeping - because if we turn these things into nag machines and people don't use the tech then we're actually going backwards. Lately I have turned off the lane keeping because I find the new recall mode to be too naggy.",teslamotors
Someone’s getting dropped here. Gonna be expensive.,teslamotors
That Rivian Treehouse is damn gorgeous looking.,teslamotors

"To give context to my metrics, if it took me 5 years to hit 65k miles in my car, it will take me another 24 years to reach end of life on the battery pack =) I don't know about you, but I generally don't keep my cars more than 7 years. I usually get bored of them. But my 3 still feels ""new"" to me, so I could see myself keeping it longer than usual. Still, when you're talking about multiple decades, the interior seems like it would be the first to fail.

Tesla's ""million mile battery"" is really only useful for commercial use vehicles when using this context, especially since their normal stuff already lasts close to half that.",teslamotors
"My current role is US focused, but I’ve worked at EV startups where I was the only person on the team and my scope covered US, Canada, Europe, Australia, China and Middle East/North Africa. So yep.

The nice thing is that outside North America, pretty much the entire world uses the UNECE regulations or some variation thereof, so it’s not as daunting as it sounds.",teslamotors
Is your personality hating on the cybertruck lol.,teslamotors
Yes because it's required by law,teslamotors
There are mclarens and other vehicles that do 0-60mph in <2s. It’s totally possible and the plaid can do less than 2s if properly prepped,teslamotors
Good.  I still need a bit more time to make my millions drop shipping mini projectors.,teslamotors
Interesting. They were the highest for my '21 F-150. 🤷‍♂️,teslamotors
"He has not identified as a Republican as far as I am aware. Just because he no longer lines up with the Democrats does not immediately make him Republican.


I'm in the same position as I feel like the Democrats have lost their damn minds in recent years and they have lost my vote as a result. But I sure as shit am not voting Republican.",teslamotors

"If you followed the Rivian sub you'd know there were SW updates since Kyle's video that have improved the charging experience. He's even documented them.

Yes, R1T's (especially early builds) are going to be less reliable overall than the 3/Y and probably the CT. But I'm not worried about the battery at all, and the video you cited indicates Rivian has good protections on the battery (which have been further refined) to prevent damage.

The CT is cool and I don't mind the design, but it's not for me. It's not a work truck and Tesla cut too many corners to make it a good lifestyle vehicle. It great for navigating the grocery store parking lot with the RWS, though. My pick order is Lightning, R1T, then a CT (assuming I could purchase with no delay).",teslamotors
I'm going to write them regarding their reliability and duty to objectivity. I suggest others do as well,teslamotors
People are prematurely irritated about something they may or may not experience directly.,teslamotors
"It also increased because there was a mistake in the statistics for years, hehe.

1.4 billion and more and more are getting old and can’t work anymore but have to be paid for, but that’s a problem that Germany has to. That’s true.",teslamotors
"V12 also pulls over to the side at the destination. It means also it may drive past the destination marker a little because a few meters further is a place to pull over.
What I don’t like about that is, it does the pull over also onto a cycle path.",teslamotors
What now?,teslamotors
What? how? A button you can press without looking will always be easiert to use and safer than doing anything on a screen,teslamotors
Design was pretty much done q4 2023 I'm sure they've some stuff to work out and the production flow but that's a 2 year gap..,teslamotors
Prices are clearly listed on their website.,teslamotors

"Why must Americans have such big expensive deathtraps in the first place? From the first time I drove I have been convinced cars are for enthusiasts and the rest of us are just dragged along by bus route budget cuts, a distinct lack of trains, and bike lanes that make you feel like you're playing frogger. All lobbied and payed for by the people selling them to you. Driving is just dangerous and should only be done by professionals or avoided in favor of something slower.",teslamotors
"Well then not all ""the public sites are going to be only v3 and above"", some will still be V2.",teslamotors
"I am by no means an expert on how batteries are made and how the chargers integrate with the batteries, but would it be a ton more expensive to have charging ports on both sides of the vehicle? That’s the first thing I thought of",teslamotors
I’m sure the increase will drive people to buy. Lol,teslamotors
Same date for me!,teslamotors
I think I know some body who can tell you otherwise...... Never mind,teslamotors
