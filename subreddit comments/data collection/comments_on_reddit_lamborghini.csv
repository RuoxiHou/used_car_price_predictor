You don’t want one for 180k it will be problems,lamborghini
Is this in Pittsburgh?,lamborghini
My all time favorite car and color.,lamborghini
Nay,lamborghini
Purple,lamborghini
"Not implying that, got your panties in a bunch lol

A condo is a glorified apartment is all",lamborghini
True but they're built with similar engineering and tolerances. You have to do the maintenance a lot less often than on racecars but it's never going to be a Camry.,lamborghini
Really glad we got the Murciélago instead of this.,lamborghini
Yes it was a good time! Lamborghini built an ice track on a lake up here in Quebec Canada where they’ve been having people out this week for some ice racing in Sterrato’s and the Urus. Good time all around!,lamborghini
"It is the same as leasing. Leasing is just a different structure, but in principal it’s the same.",lamborghini
The issue with this car is that I see it and I just wish it was called an Aventador.,lamborghini
I barely noticed him after I took the picture & went back through my Gallery lol,lamborghini
Tell your wife we said yes.  Now go get that soccer mom her car. Or grow a set and get that Huracan you really want.,lamborghini
Get that thing off the rear wing,lamborghini
That is beautiful,lamborghini
"That’s why rentals are kind of silly unless you have experience. 

If you want to rent them, do one of those track days where they let you push it just a bit. 

Then when you rent an exotic, you can actually have some fun. Otherwise you’ll be doing what you see on the internet with no understanding of how they that actually works physically/mechanically.",lamborghini
The bottom one gives it more character however I don't think it goes with that color..maybe with white or green or red will look good,lamborghini
Love the Alcantara lol,lamborghini
My son got an Aventador and he did fine,lamborghini
That I’m not 100% on but I was thinking it was when I had seen it in person,lamborghini
"If that’s a wrap, that’s dope",lamborghini
damn 250 in world is crazy.,lamborghini
Interesting. Thank you. I like the wrap color more than the blue but I’ve always wanted a matte black one anyways,lamborghini
How the hell does the dude not hear the sound difference between his supposed huracan and a aventador,lamborghini
"Saw one in person, beautiful car.",lamborghini
"If anything major needs attention, just flatbed it to the dealer.  If it's your only car, disregard.  My tow truck driver just retired, but he delivered exotics for dealers hundreds of miles away and picked them up for service as well.  Very common.",lamborghini
You might be shocked at how many people live in the city and have Lamborghinis,lamborghini
Not to mention driving experience of a gated manual,lamborghini
Agreed,lamborghini
This 😂,lamborghini
"I mean, are you asking how clean they were when you took the picture? How clean they are now? Do they get parked indoors or outdoors? 

Man we need more information to answer your question.",lamborghini
Guy on the left in the green shirt looks like he is selling the extended warranty,lamborghini
Nuh uh Murcielago hotter 🗿,lamborghini
Nah Lambo and Ferrari hold value pretty well similar to Porsche. Because of rarity and lack of supply.,lamborghini
"As stated above, be wise with your money, you are obviously doing extreamly well for your self at such a young age. I had come in to money when i was 17, i bought  cars and tbh drugs with is money when i could have bought a house outright. Now i have nothing.",lamborghini
"Having owned both, my 2015 LP610-4 was way more raw feeling than my 2020 Evo 4AWD. I would still pick the evo over the LP because of the inside update though.",lamborghini
"sheeesh boy! 

Congratulations",lamborghini
"We have no choice. I understand the appeal of being a snowbird and leaving this cold place.

That said. This winter has been very mild. Odd.",lamborghini
I have no problem with these posts if allowed but there’s just no creativity here. You just used the stock scapes movies instead of taking some pics of your own or using race footage of you on a track which I do appreciate a lot. Plus the livery on the car is just terrible. Plus your title makes no sense unless I’m too old to know what it means…,lamborghini
Whats the difference,lamborghini
"I would love to do that one, maybe next year!",lamborghini
Must have,lamborghini
Viola Parsifae,lamborghini
"Ah yeah you like the Murci sound better. Make sense. It’s  an amazing sound. 
I prefer that Aventador scream haha.",lamborghini
Give me a thumbs up in my stupid little Japanese car 😭,lamborghini
I think Verde Selvans.,lamborghini
"I like aventador looks better, this cool, but w,e … new countach was great tho, they nailed that",lamborghini
"Did it have a german license plate? Just curious because I’m sure this is a 1of1 and I’ve seen this one before.

Color should be verde hydra",lamborghini
"If you see a vent, and a door, you already know what it is.",lamborghini
"As a tractor, no.

Jokes aside, I think non-TEB is kind of rare, but for sure not what people buying Huracans are looking for.",lamborghini
You’d likely be paying $1k-$2k a month in insurance.,lamborghini

Yup,lamborghini

"Harder to gauge since it’s an older car now, sure you’ll have your typical oil and tire changes but things can and will go wrong, like any old car, and that’s harder to budget for",lamborghini
What car?,lamborghini
I’m sorry what,lamborghini
jdm style gallardo,lamborghini
Full on carbon!!,lamborghini
460 moderno pisto spyder,lamborghini
www.google.com,lamborghini
Need to make a James Bond Lambo that has defensive measures and somehow fucks the truck towing the car or puts the thieves to sleep. Sorry to hear that you have had multiple things stolen man. I leave my car running where I live bur it’s also an older civic 😂,lamborghini
The revuelto will sound louder than the aventador once it releases plus that single clutch ain't gonna be a problem anymore,lamborghini
"Not gonna lie. Saw the pic and thought, I love that color on a c8.",lamborghini
"I'd confirm the car was never been wrapped, never buy a wrapped car or a car that been wrapped. Someone had that panel off and didn't know how to put it back on",lamborghini
Man the rear looks so bad,lamborghini
Don't let her learn how to drive from chat gpt,lamborghini
I mean technically Chiron is Bugatti Vision GT,lamborghini
"Yes drive away with your plastic car!

Being under VAG group Lamborghini cars have better engine and better quality compared to the older ones,lamborghini
I like it!,lamborghini
Both,lamborghini
It’s 3d printed. Where’d ya get it from,lamborghini
Viola Pasifae is a top 5 Lamborghini color,lamborghini
You mentioned it someone in the post. I'm bored at work lol.,lamborghini
Green lambos always look so cool,lamborghini
"Can completely agree to this. Got also an Evo AWD. The AWD gives such a nice extra. Plus of course the touch screen with carplay, worth the extra money, we live in 2024, and will help a lot in resale. Not to forget the Evo 20/21 is different to the newer or older ones, extreme sound and fantastic performance.",lamborghini
Shrug as long as he likes it. It's his car.,lamborghini
"I dunno, they were never offered to dealers just to VVIPs like the Aventador Countach.",lamborghini
If you pre paid years in advance yes.,lamborghini
Park in a Kroger parking lot,lamborghini
What car show?,lamborghini
I \*think\* a dealer can install it; someone please correct me if I'm wrong.,lamborghini
I had to come to reddit to figure out how to do it. It's a really stupid method lol,lamborghini
Really going out on a limb with that statement,lamborghini
Give us a ballpark,lamborghini
"I used to work the parts department for a Lambo dealer here in NJ, I don’t see why another shop wouldn’t be able to service your vehicle. Idk how It is where u live but in Nj there’s tons of reputable shops to work on exotics around, the only thing would be tsb’s and recalls, if you find a reputable shop by you just ask if they are able to do those services as well. Idk if you would have to pay for It to get done tho at a third party cause at the dealer those are free and billed to lambo. I mean maybe the third party servicer can work out where they get the part for free and the dealer still bills lambo, I honestly don’t know. Just something to think about.",lamborghini
"I’ve always loved Alex chois whips, hope to be able to take pics one day with him",lamborghini
The Aventador is a timeless classic. Too soon to be praising this one in such a way...,lamborghini
"It depends on the dealer, and dealers aren’t made aware of their allocations until a month before the allocations are available. 

If the dealership has a list of previous customers waiting for an allocation, there is a chance the dealer does not care how much money you have.",lamborghini
"I’m surprised at how often I look at these posts and the cars in a great many cases, out classes the house. In my generation it was save, save, save. Now I think it’s spend, spend, spend. This generation realizes you can’t take it with you and who wants to leave it to the kids.",lamborghini
Omfg,lamborghini
"No, it is the LP 610-4, so AWD.  Actually does really well in the snow.  It was a blizzard and I was the only one out on the road, and so that is why it is so white.  The car is a lot of fun in the snow - mostly worried about other drivers!",lamborghini
"the 20k akrapovic from lambo is not worth it at all

like other people said, novitec is a great choice for half the price",lamborghini
Enrico Pallazzo!,lamborghini
"Yes, but most of those are gloss black. *semigloss* black is where it starts getting fun again.",lamborghini
 What does “don’t panic” refer to? Sick af otherwise.,lamborghini
Wow. Not as bad as I imagined. Not bad at all.,lamborghini
"Yeah it's a place called SJ Specialist Cars, and yeah it deserves either a way better showroom or a more isolated spot so it can stand out more",lamborghini
"I agree with you too. If I were to buy a revuelto, I would definitely buy the part under the headlight in body color.",lamborghini
"Because the Aventador is overrated. 

Definitely this. It's sexy",lamborghini
You clearly don’t own one of these,lamborghini
"Yeah’p.

That’s swinging.",lamborghini
"Lol, I heard some real bad stuff about insurance companies many times for youngsters with expensive cars. Is it really THAT bad?",lamborghini
Take all in with a smile 😃.  You’re living part of someone else’s dream sometimes,lamborghini
Then buy it and have fun with it. $189 is a great price. You could probably sell it for $175k in 2-3 years. That’s $5k a year to drive a Lamborghini around.,lamborghini
That’s a huracan. Aventadors have a big vent on the door. aVENTaDOOR,lamborghini
"Before there was a dealer in Nashville, Atlanta's dealer sent a car transport to my home to pick up and deliver the car when it needed maintenance. It's about 4 hours driving distance. Maybe the Chicago dealer would do the same? Can't hurt to ask.",lamborghini
Nice hood fitment 👌🏽,lamborghini
Thanks for the input! Let me research them,lamborghini
Don’t insurance companies declare them total loss once a vehicle is stolen? My biggest worry is losing my cars and then getting back with a salvage title,lamborghini
Trash next to an STO,lamborghini
"fiberglass kit? molded from a real supertrofeo body? does the mounting point for the street car?

Have quite a few questions, but this is sick.",lamborghini
"It’s impossible to wear anything but a smile in a lambo.

To be fair anytime someone has their phone out recording the car, i give them a bit of a show in it lol",lamborghini
Forget the Lambo I hope you are maxing out a Roth IRA every year. That can turn into millions of dollars later,lamborghini
"they been doing that for decades.. special financing thru lambo, ferrari, etc..",lamborghini
Future proof,lamborghini
"what the heck, i thought 911s are the only ones that hold value..

maybe these cars aren't that expensive to own after all. 

i just assumed almost every high-end car that's not a 911 will depreciate like a land rover range rover/maserati quattroporte",lamborghini
What do those number represent under the V10 badge on the 6th pic?,lamborghini
This is why i drive a ratshit Jeep. (I cant afford a Lamborghini anyway),lamborghini
I’d grab it for $4k if it’s a civic,lamborghini
Wrapped cars are scary because who knows what’s underneath,lamborghini
Find a local independent exotic mechanic,lamborghini
Definitely not. needs the lift.,lamborghini
This is my buddy Dennis' car.,lamborghini
Green one,lamborghini
is there a time when it wont,lamborghini
I don’t really have a favorite color. I like earth tones I suppose but there is something about this color of purple that I like really like but specifically when it’s on a Lamborghini. ,lamborghini
"I would avoid any exotic with an accident reported, and I would be vary wary of any wrapped car (as you don't know the condition of the paint, or if they are trying to hid something).... Combine both of those conditions, and I would scrub this car from my memory, as a potential candidate.   


In regards to the Ferrari, I will point out two things specifically that you should heavily consider.   


1. Ferraris are much less reliable/require more maint, especially the early 458s. If you buy from a dealer and you get a warranty, you are married to that dealer, no matter how bad they might be (local F dealer has screwed up 2 of my friend's cars).    

2. Since Jul 2022 (market peak) 458s are down 5.4% and 610s are down 4.8%",lamborghini

even better yet,lamborghini

Huracán Performante is only offered in all wheel drive.,lamborghini
Wow! That’s great to hear.,lamborghini
They sound amazing but they’re kinda slow,lamborghini
The community is so good too. Like it’s actually  where you find all these young guys who want to be successful pushing each other everyday. Love it honestly.,lamborghini
"It got wet, it's totalled",lamborghini
Definitely the purple. Lamborghinis were made for loud colors ,lamborghini

Makes me sad knowing we cant travel in space because it take like hundreds to millions of years to travel anywhere cool,lamborghini
Really glad you like my work! I'll send you a chat message with pricing details :-),lamborghini
What gives.   It’s not even a Sterrato.  You are a brave sole,lamborghini
"I'm biased, but the Perf is the best Huracan, imo.",lamborghini
Lol that’s not how it works… anymore,lamborghini
"I’m sure they can be, however having a primary GPS what the crooks aim for, and having a secondary set of AirTags which they may not suspect are even present, gives the owner that much of an upper hand.",lamborghini
"No, you assumed I was saying something and said I was stupid for something you made up in your head lmao",lamborghini
Looks like an origin 300i in starcitizen,lamborghini
Why the fuck would you use an AI generated image of a huracan when it is one of the most popular supercars of the past decade with millions of photos taken of it? Get the fuck outta here,lamborghini
man I hated rear wheel drive in the snow at Livigno when driving on the ice track,lamborghini
"Probably an Ultimae, could be a Sian though so I’m  not 100% sure.",lamborghini
Idk. I think it's my favorite Aventador out of all the variations. The front end looks so cool with the wider grills,lamborghini
Viola pasifae right? Stunning car.,lamborghini
"There are so few cars on the road they can carry that color, but the purple looks incredible.",lamborghini
I’d have me number 1499.,lamborghini

"The French one was sold to a german in 2022, I think we’re talking about the same car! There’s only one coupe in this spec as far as i know. And a British roadster",lamborghini
Ahh yes the model with a plus one smaller exhaust. lol ai is so funny. Photo is sick af though.,lamborghini

"The front looks so good

What the fuck happened to the back of the car? This can't be the successor to the Aventador",lamborghini
Bro this was super OG. I agree with this one. He chopped a sunroof into his murci on the side of the highway after picking up billy idol if I recall correctly.,lamborghini
Need the right tires for winter time. Not worth losing your car over the winter. Especially in Chicago when you get rear ended by another car in the ice.,lamborghini

"Try racing planes!

Although now that Reno is shut down, I guess you can’t any more. So yeah you’re probably right.",lamborghini
I’m curious. How can you tell it’s a Performante? I saw one identical in Boise.,lamborghini
There's literally only 1 photo,lamborghini
Psilocybin will have that effect at times 😵‍💫,lamborghini
Yes they sure do.,lamborghini
"Aventador is much cooler looking and better sounding (with the right exhaust) in my eyes, also more legendary",lamborghini
"Hell yeah. Thing was sweet. Exhaust tone was fairly quiet, but the whistle was prominent",lamborghini
Aventador has my heart. I’m choosing that V12 bull 🐂🔥,lamborghini
"I’d personally prefer the OG aventador with its clean curves and edges before they started adding bits and bobs everywhere, it seems over engineered.",lamborghini
"Love it. Absolutely love the design.   
But guess I have to compain about something... The interior doesn't look futuristic enough if you compare it to Ferrari SF90 interior or even Tesla Model S Plaid.",lamborghini
matte purple,lamborghini
"I would almost always go with purple if it’s an option for a car, it’s uncommon and typically sexy as hell.

In this example, 100000000% black, I actually hate the purple. 

I’d for sure take it though if someone is giving ‘em out lol",lamborghini
So cringe,lamborghini
Lambo Tractor.,lamborghini
Mine,lamborghini
"This Lamborghini is no doubt a fun car, but it’s a bad investment. You can try hard to convince yourself otherwise, but it will always remain true. 

That being said, if the 458 doesn’t have any “blemishes” on its history then it’s a solid investment opportunity and it’s only slightly less performance. Performance at a level you probably won’t see often.",lamborghini
"It sucks. Lamborghini has lost their imagination with design ever since they were bought by Audi. The revuelto is lazy on all aspects from the name of it, it’s not a revolutionary car and far from it, the design is lacking on all aspects and looks as if it was designed in the boardroom and still looks like the aventador. The inside looks no different and is getting pretty dated with the fighter jet theme. That was the reventon and that time it has passed, please please please come up with a new interior design. All in all they have kept the same design theme since the reventon and can’t seem to stray away from that which is sad.",lamborghini
"You know everyone that’s ridden in your car in the past two years? Sorry, I don’t.",lamborghini
This is the best color!,lamborghini
My mom,lamborghini
"Sorry to hear, brother. I’d be absolutely pissed as I learned Lamborghini isn’t taking anymore orders for these.",lamborghini
Are we talking about a normal (like LP610) Huracan? He said 992 GT3 but no info on the Huracan. If its something like LP610 IMO 992 is the way to go. But if its a Evo then Huracan is the way to go.,lamborghini
love this pic,lamborghini
Is that an LS intake manifold laying on top of the rear valance? 🤔,lamborghini

"its like looking back at me haha

I was 15 when i had roughly 60k euro,  this was from resseling sneakers back when it was still posible, and thanks to my dad who agreed to do it under his name

I always wanted aswell to get a lambo,  had the gallardo in mind

Now fast forward im 20 and i got about 1.4 mil all,  because i bought bitcoin during the dip at 7k euro each

And i still am not able to get a lambo sadly,  and i will state my reasons

A huracan isabout 200k with good mileage, keep in mind the cheap ones where rentals and theyll break on you fast

Insurance i got qoated 25k a year due to my age,  on my dads name he got quated 14k a year

On top of that in belgium where i live the first year road tax is 30k euro ish give or take,  beacuse of the v10 engine and stricter regulations

And after that its about 10k a year in tax

If things where to go wrong i always make sure i can survive from my job alone,  wich atm pays 25k a year netto

So yeah you can prob buy a huracan,  but it will use all your capital

Not even going to get into where your going to store the car,  beacuse you need to also buy a house with a garage,  leaving the car outside you will loose it in a week

Even if you buy a garage box for about 20k,  give it a few months before it gets stolen from there aswell

As you can see allot of money just for a lambo

Buy a Bmw M car intsead,  reliable and under 80k for a newer m4 comp or m5

With my 1.4 mill i was only able to afford an aston martin vatange v8, i got it for 70k and insurance is ok,  so is the tax for the moment,  and a daily bmw x4",lamborghini

"Theres a film sold on Amazon called “STICKER SHIELD” specifically for this, I’ve got one for my vehicle inspection sticker.",lamborghini
What happens with insurance?,lamborghini
I believe they were standard.  Some people have retrofitted the earlier cars with aftermarket alternatives.  Many people replace the dated Audi stereo system.  There are some drop in replacements that add CarPlay and are fairly OEM looking.  That’s a good time to add a rear camera.  It very much helps to have a rear camera when backing up.  Due to the low seating position and the mid engine rear visibility is quite challenging.  Anyone considering these cars I would really suggest test driving one.  For similar money you can get the same performance out of a modern vette.  You can get better acceleration off the line out of many electric vehicles.  The Gallardo is probably one of the last supercars that left you with a bit of Stockholm syndrome.  It wants to be driven hard.  It will grumble and buck in traffic.  But for a small subset of people when you get out of it you will have a big dumb grin in your face.  ,lamborghini

"So while the LED driving lights on the bumper (vs bonnet) are stylistically contentious for sure,  the Sterrato is a Huracan Evo AWD with aoftwr and higher suspension, a roof scoop and knobby tires…so for purposes of understanding what else is “f’ing weird”? 

You mean why people would want it and its purpose?

I will tell you that it’s the most fun in a Lamborghini I’ve had with the least amount of anxiety — no driveway or parking drama, no rough road issues, and the fact that I can actually enjoy it “off pavement” (off-road is subjective, for sure…)

At any rate, not for everyone but I love it and I’ve bolted a bunch of shit to the roof because I take it “off pavement” quite often!",lamborghini

"I find it ironic people could refer to this as a 'pure' lambo, it was the first under Audi who are better guardians of the brand than the various owners in the 90s, and this platform paved the way for the modern Lambos which use the same DNA but with more Lambo lunacy

"This is a great rule of thumb to follow, but only applies if you’re looking at really long term ownership. When you look at those digital gauges and displays from the 1980s cars you think Gosh this is OLD.  At the time they were new and exiting and now they date the car tremendously. Same applies to 90s and 00s cars. So sooner or later just about all digital displays, no matter how fresh they look now, will look out of date eventually. But does that matter to you? Depends on whether you’re keeping the car for many years or just a few years. 

Here is my take - the Huracan has a digital gauge cluster so regardless of buttons vs touch screens in the center console, the main screen you look at all the time will get outdated eventually. Just accept it and be ok with it. So don’t pick your model based on center console format. Pick based on performance, design, ease of use, and etc.",lamborghini

Idk about the GT3s but my 992 GTS does the same. It’s like 3-4k or something they will not fully open. They can open partially if u open valves but not 100% and even when at high rpm I’m not sure if it opens 100% cause of the way they tuned it with the pressure. There are little things to keep it open 100% I guess but can’t be bothered.,lamborghini

"The main differences between a 1990 Honda Accord and a 2020 Lamborghini Huracan Evo are:

1. Performance: The Huracan Evo is a high-performance sports car with significantly more horsepower, acceleration, and top speed compared to the Accord.

2. Technology: The Huracan Evo is equipped with advanced technology features such as touchscreen infotainment systems, driver assistance systems, and performance tracking tools, while the Accord from 1990 would have much simpler technology by comparison.

3. Design: The Huracan Evo has a sleek, aerodynamic design tailored for performance, while the Accord from 1990 has a more traditional sedan design.

4. Price: The Huracan Evo is a luxury sports car with a significantly higher price tag compared to the Accord, which is a more affordable, mass-market vehicle.

5. Driving Experience: The driving experience of the Huracan Evo would be more exhilarating and sporty, with precise handling and responsive performance, whereas the Accord would offer a more comfortable and practical driving experience suited for daily commuting and family use.

Totally. Ferrari financial actually has a special program for this that is essentially an interest only balloon payment. 5 year loan 59 months of basically interest 60th payment is the full remainder.

"Perhaps it's due to my age (13 vs 25), but it doesn't excite me as much as the first time I saw the Aventador. But then again, I fell in love at first glance seeing the Sian.

Maybe think of it this way. The design of the Revuelto to the Sian is like what Aventador is to Reventon. Adapted design language for the mass produced model. But where the Aventador made it more aggressive, the Revuelto tones it down a little.

It's growing on me, and as a Lambo fan & a die cast collector, I'm eager to have one.",lamborghini

I was hoping your report would be positive, and it sounds like, for the most part, it is.

Tecnica,lamborghini
"I mean it’s subjective, they are all amazing in their own right, which car do you like the most and what will its purpose be. 

The R8 and Huracan share a chassis and many parts, I personally like the Lamborghini design and interior more but that is subjective. R8 is much of the same performance for cheaper also if that matters. Huracans were always very reliable too(r8 too I guess by since they do share much of the same dna). Many of the times cars came in during my tenure was for their interval servicing or a nail in the tire. Even if you did have to ship the car for tsb’s or recalls I couldn’t picture It being often and you should probably check to see if any car you are looking at has had all available ones done prior to purchase so you are up date. The GT3 is great I have friends that love them and swear by them and they are track monsters, my friends that have Porsches all tend to be huge PCA guys and it’s like Porsche or nothing to them. 

I haven’t driven the GT3 but have the R8 and Huracan and personally a Huracan is my goal to get to and what I would go for. Looks, interior, my personal favorite brand, and throw a titanium exhaust on It  and It creates perfection, although the stock sound is more than adequate. If I was going to get an R8 It would probably have to be the early-mid 2010’s V10 manual as that intrigues me, however I haven’t driven the manual but I assume it’s gotta be fun. 

Prior to purchasing I would find and check out a reputable local exotic shop you would feel comfortable working on your car. Maybe ask them if they are able to do the recalls and technical service bulletins as that pretty much eliminates any need for the dealer. Also look for a car with nose lift if you do pursue It, you won’t regret it. I wish you well and hope what little 2 cents I have helps you sort things outs out a little better.",lamborghini

I bought a car that had a good PPI, the wrap was in good condition and had a PPF on top of it too, the previous owner spent a ton of money on it. The selling dealer did not know how long the wrap had been on, but since the PPI was good and the wrap was still in great condition I bought anyways. When I went to unwrap it turns out it had been on way too long, the total cost to just unwrap was $6k. Luckily for me the paint condition underneath was fine, but theres also times where the wrap covers up a bad paint job or other problems that can cost even more.",lamborghini

Ahah a 1.85 inch lift , better suspension and skid plates and shit ahaha  damn it must be a rally car 😂😂 

If you have enough money to buy this car and you actually buy it, you must really like the way it looks, or you literally have so much money you don’t know what to do with  … just because you gave a Lambo a few of the perks of an off-road vehicle, doesn’t turn it into an off-road vehicle… i’m guessing the off roading that people do with this is more “county roading” than “off roading”

"You should not be buying one of these cars if the most important thing is resale value. They aren't rare or investment cars, Lambo made a ton of V10s. You cannot also bank on the V10 appreciating in value when the V8 Hybrid comes out, that's over 2 years away and we don't know if it's compelling or not. It could offer features that the majority of folks want therefore the V10 value would drop.

">Are Lamborghinis that bad of a track cars?

Lamborghini held the Nurburgring production car lap record 2 separate times with the Huracan Performante and Aventador SVJ, and could've gotten it a third time with the Aventador SV had VW not stepped in to prevent them from upstaging Porsche. They make extremely capable track cars. 

That said, despite their claims 10 years ago to prioritize handling more than other performance departments, handling is still not that big a priority for them in the grand scheme of things. Their best track cars are their highest end cars, while the rest of them prioritize ""the Lamborghini experience"" above all else. 

Ferrari prioritizes handling a lot more than Lamborghini do, so the result is that their cars are, on average, better handlers than Lamborghini, but they do not yet have a car on par with the best from Lamborghini. Or maybe they do, but they don't care for Nurburgring lap records so we'll never know what their ceiling is. 

It's sort of like the difference between BMW and Mercedes 10 or so years ago. You went BMW if you wanted a car that felt dynamic in the corners, but you went Mercedes if you wanted a more theatrical experience. However, the ceiling was a lot higher with Mercedes since they actually had a high performance sports car while BMW did not.",lamborghini

Having one or the other, or both, doesn't really makes a difference unfortunately - unless you're lucky and the thieves have a GPS only jammer, which is unlikely as most organised criminal gangs know that trackers use a multitude of protocols so will have a jammer that subsequently targets all of these.

The EVO is the better buy for many reasons.

- Better looking rear

Also something to consider is the equity you will keep or grow in the EVO considering the V10 is gone. 

It will be easier to resell an EVO in the future as opposed to a 2015. Same goes for trade-in if you decide to trade-up.

"Let the Lambo be a dream for now, it'll motivate you to a point where hopefully 300-400k is a drop in a very large bucket for you.   
Another point to consider is that any car at that level is going to seem like a handful for a new driver, not trying to offend or assume you dont/wont know what you're doing, but maybe dropping less cash on something awesome that you can use to ease into the power and layout of a Hur might work out better in the long run? if you plan and research that correctly you could even get something dope for a first car that won't depreciate/may appreciate over time, making that a secondary investment for you.

Now I'm 35 and it cost me $92 to insure my Huracan Evo AWD. Id buy a house first with that money.

The newer one will be in warranty and the older one won’t. Worth considering. On the other hand with low mileage there’s not much damage that could have been done anyway. Just take it for a prepurchase inspectuon.

EDIT: don't forget to get the VIN number and run it through carreport.com to get the accident history, and ask the owner for the full service book.

There is usually a 100k-200k premium over MSRP for a v12 car that is in demand.  On the allocation for a special edition, that is a different story.

To add to discussion, 90% of new money from Covid have not experienced automotive market fluctuation / new exotic model replacement depreciation. 

Anyone that had a Gallardo when the Huracan came out got hurt. As the cars are getting more difficult to finance for a lot of people, there will be a pretty steep depreciation hit on the Huracan moving forward.. Because those that can afford the new models do offload the older model coupled with lease returns, etc. Huracans will be back in the $130k range sooner than later.",lamborghini

"A small step forward but not a leap. The rear is gorgeous, especially the diffusers. The profile is fine. The front has ups and downs. The Y shaped LED lights are nice and modern, but the the hood and front intakes could’ve been better. The engine bonnet is very underwhelming. The top view of the car (especially on the rear half) reminds me of a C8 corvette and ford GT which is not up to standards for lamborghini’s v12 flagship. The interior is also underwhelming. It lacks the jet fighter cockpit look of the Aventador and looks like the interior of a McLaren 570s.

Overall, Lamborghini’s flagship v12 models have always brought about a new era in exotic car design. The countach established the DNA of lamborghini. The diablo refined the countach’s boxy look with sleek curves and rounded edges. The murcielago modernized the diablo with angular details. The aventador turned lamborghini into a jet fighter on wheels. The revuelto, on the other hand, takes all the innovative designs of the aventador and exaggerates it. Again, nothing new or revolutionary but instead capitalizing on an old trend. Overall, a 6.5/10.",lamborghini

With that being said i do think its a good platform to build off of. thinking maybe a svj variat or some other future trim level can change the front a little and give it a similar road presences as the aventador",lamborghini

All lambos are awesome and deserve respect - even the older ones. Feruccio Lamborghini wanted a supercar to rival ferrari - it eventually happened. Rejection doesn't always mean you failed at life. All lambo owners worked hard to get to the point where they could afford one. Don't lose hope if everyone seems to reject you. The dreams may become a reality if you don't give up.

"There are 2 generations with the 1st gen being 04-08 and the second gen 09 on. The second gen is referred to as LP due to the change in the engine which gives it slightly more horsepower.  The 2nd gen is considered more desirable due to its ease of driving as well as its easier to source engine block should you need repairs.  The 1st gen has a different firing order resulting in a sound some prefer.  Both gens are single clutch and will feel jerky off the line.  The 04s are probably the least desirable.  By 06 they had added a backup camera, a front lift and a shorter first gear making it a better driving experience.  Many would consider those necessary.  If you really like to drive many would consider a manual rear wheel drive Gallardo to be the purest car.  Of note the Valentino balboni edition is this configuration and he was the test driver for Lamborghini.  E-gears can be converted to manual at some expense.  The conversion to rear wheel is reversible and inexpensive.  As for maintenance, some of them burn oil and there are a few common issues like the cat disintegrating into the engine but it’s basically an Audi.  Of note, the original clutches sometimes didn’t last past 30k miles and you should find out how much life is left on the clutch as it’s a $10k replacement.  Your repair costs will vary widely on how well maintained the car has been and whether or not you have a mechanic you trust.  The first gen Gallardo require the Lara-as computer to do major service and not everyone has those.  Getting fixed at the dealer will result in a lambo tax and Lambo parts.  Over at Lamborghini-talk.com there’s a database of Gallardo parts that came from other manufacturers and compatible parts which can result in much cheaper repairs. 
Edit: I forgot to mention the front bumper and tail lights changed significantly in 2009.  There are many aftermarket versions of those so sometimes the earlier cars have been made to look like the newer cars.  There were several different bumpers after 2009 depending on what model you got.  ",lamborghini

"Fuck all these comments, don't listen to people who are not where you want to be in life. I am a fellow software founder & supercar(s) owner here is what I would do if I was in your position.

First step, talk to a CPA and understand your tax liability for the money you are making. You need to start thinking in POST TAX money. So you make 100k in profit. Uncle sam (federal gov) taking 40% + your states % if you live in a state with state income tax. I know it sucks but the sooner you ingrain this in your head the better you will be. (Hint: there is no way around the taxes,\* usually ;) ) The best way to do this so one, you don't die and two you position yourself nicely is - when you turn 18, immediately go to a dealer and get a car NOT A LAMBO, and get a loan on it. Think a car in the 60-100k range, RS5, M4, etc.. something enough to scratch the sports car itch but not Lambo yet. Put down half or even more, just get a auto loan under your belt for your credit. Keep running the biz and running it the fuck up, once you feel like you can part ways with 100-150k - use that cash as a down payment on load for lambo, but seriously wait at minimum 6 months from 18 so one you don't kys in a lambo and two for your credit.

&#x200B;

And for the people in the comments who think saving money is how you get rich, newsflash buddy boii, if you want to get fucking rich in this life you need to take risk, calculated risk. Not shoving all your money into a retirement account or some bullshit. If you want to get RICH, saving is dumb. You need to INCREASE your INCOME. This will go over the heads of all the normies/W2s in the comments LOL.",lamborghini

"If they release something new and you get to a dealer there's a good chance you get one. But again, this is all dependent on the area and dealer. If you see Lambo testing a new Reveulto SV, there's a decent chance there is a list of existing customers texting reps to put them on ""their list"" as you are not the only one to observe the testing. You're not actually banned from getting the car because you haven't owned a Lambo, but you're unlikely to be priority if you haven't done business with a dealer prior to release.

However, I'm giving a hypothetical of going to a dealer for the existing Revuelto. They are sold out until the end of 2026.

I'm sure if you were willing to do something stupid you could get one, but a dealer isn't going to be prioritizing new and (as far as they are concerned) financially unqualified customers for limited releases/hot new cars.",lamborghini

"I know this is the Lambo sub and I loved my Huracan, but I'd 100% go for the 458. They are very likely to shoot up in value in a major way and the design just looks even more exotic year after year as it ages.

That said, if you do choose to go with that particular Huracan, I'd would strongly advise you take it somewhere to get a thorough inspection. Assuming you're in LA, see if O'Gara Coach can do a PPI for you.

The wrap is the other issue, can they verify the quality of the body and paint work underneath? I'm assuming they wouldn't agree to unwrap it for an inspection, that feels like a big red flag to me.

I guess my ultimate advice would be to treat the car as an investment piece, even if you do plan to daily it. Think about it down the line - if you decide to sell it, will you break even, lose money or make money? A damaged Huracan under a wrap with a bunch of additional miles almost certainly loses value. The 458 likely ends up selling for more than you paid for it.",lamborghini

On the plus side the Gallardo probably won’t depreciate that much and at least for me the insurance wasn’t as expensive as I thought it would be.  I bought a new sienna the same year I bought the used Gallardo and when I sell the Gallardo by my math it will have cost about the same as the new sienna maybe even less depending on if I keep getting lucky on not needing repairs. ,lamborghini

"You are doing awesome at 16. 70k to ur name. It’s miles ahead. Especially it’s ur hard work money.  Don’t blow it on a car. Get a house/condo. Realistically speaking at least in Canada. Most people. Event my age group (im 25)  they can’t afford a home any time soon with the crazy high prices. 

My family helps me out alot. At 18 they gave me a choice between a car or a condo and I pick the condo 600k back then. Now it’s worth 1.2m and I finished paying off the mortgage. 

Yet those “cool” kids in high school driving nice car is not exactly no where in life. But their cool car definitely depreciated hard. 

Funny thing is. I bought a Supra in 2022 and I sold it few months back to put down another down payment for my own home. I need to work my ass off to pay it off. But hey. Another home. I can rent one out. And make some passive income. 

You are a smart kid. Don’t get sucked into those “TikTok” hype trends or whatever else there is. 

I’m in insurance and I work pretty hard to be where I am. My family still helps out. Especially with my down payment. I put down 70k they put down 80k for me. 

Like I love cars, but they ain’t shit compared to houses. Think the long game. Do girls like cars or houses more?  How many of those guys out there flexing, but they are renting a home not to mention financing or leasing their car.

"Buying a high-performance car like a Lamborghini Huracan with 34k miles is definitely a decision to consider carefully. While these cars are built to high standards, the lifespan can vary depending on how well it's been maintained and driven. Here are some factors to consider:  
Maintenance History: Check if the car has been regularly serviced according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A well-documented maintenance history is a good sign that the car has been taken care of.  
Driving Conditions: High mileage doesn't necessarily mean the car has been abused, but it's important to consider the driving conditions. If it's been primarily driven on the track or in harsh conditions, it could have more wear and tear.  
Inspection: Have a trusted mechanic or specialist perform a thorough inspection of the vehicle. They can assess the condition of the engine, transmission, suspension, brakes, and other critical components.  
Warranty: If the car is still under warranty, that can provide some peace of mind. However, you should confirm whether the warranty is transferrable to you as the new owner.  
Price: $187k seems like a reasonable price for a Huracan with that mileage, but it's essential to compare it with similar cars on the market and consider any additional costs for maintenance and repairs.  
Ultimately, buying a high-mileage exotic car like a Huracan comes down to your comfort level with the potential risks and your budget for maintenance and repairs. If you're unsure, it might be worth considering a lower mileage example or investing in a comprehensive warranty for added protection.",lamborghini

"A) Some toll tags use RFID so seeing them isn't really the issue, but being able to read the signal. Easy to test by putting them somewhere and driving through a toll and checking your account for it to hit - or some places have a 'test toll' you can roll through just to verify it reads  


B) Show cars I used to work with years ago with Tint would actually have the tint shop put them it by cutting the exact shape out of the tint. Like a wood inlay might be done by a wood worker.

"Agree with PPI. Really though, Huracan’s are one of the more “practical” Lamborghinis. It could easily handle bumper to bumper traffic. This and the R8 use the same engine, if there are R8’s with high mileages being sold, what makes you think the Huracan can’t be a DD?

On video, nothing sounds like an SVJ with a Gintani, but an LP700 next to an SVJ while next to a Murci doesn't sound wildly different if they're all revving together.

"Does the standard exhaust use a vacuum valve system? Might be worthwhile investigating if you can bypass this. Sometimes, it's just a case of using a $5 clip or pulling a fuse.",lamborghini
"Sure was, I’d go back immediately if we had a chance like that.",lamborghini
Your opinion denied,lamborghini
Based on the badge...probably a Kia Aventador.,lamborghini
100% yes. We plan on shooting some videos at a local auto-x track and there are plenty of back-roads where I live.,lamborghini
Fake BS!  Notice how all the cables are conveniently disconnected!,lamborghini
"I lived in Old Town and bombed around in a Diablo and a Countach occasionally in the winter. 

While your car is infinitely more sophisticated in terms of electronic traction nannies, it will still suck. 

Tires are likely beyond bad at Chicago winter temps, mine were super sketchy once it hit low 30s.

I feel like Chicago salt trucks get paid by the volume they dump on the streets, and it tends to linger until a hard rain.

Lake effect snow? Really want to drive  your lambo in that? I don’t know where to start here but safety would be my primary concern.

Get a depreciated Maserati as a second car throw all seasons on it and thrash it like you’re on a winter rally stage.",lamborghini
"Dude, I literally did mine myself in 20 minutes. You just have to remove the carpet component of the front trunk and pull out the battery. I literally bought one from Costco for $180.",lamborghini
"Mf, I barely used Reddit. See my account. You’re the Retard. Some Reddit dork telling me I am retard because I made one post about maybe owning a lambo when I’m 18. Moron.",lamborghini

Could you elaborate on this? I've never seen advice about buying wrapped cars until now.",lamborghini

"Yea but invested money doubles every 9 years. Time is free money for invested earnings. Invest as much as you can now and you’ll thank yourself later.

If you want to spend a little enjoy life for sure, but have a budget and don’t blow your whole wad on a deprecating asset. Why not rent one for a month or sometijng instead?",lamborghini

Also the side vents. Aventador has huge vents. Huracan is like the photo smaller towards the side skirts.,lamborghini
I had my gallardo serviced at our local speed shop. My bow gen2 v10 plus r8 is also serviced there even tho there is an Audi dealer 20 min away.,lamborghini
I have mine lowered with Novitec and the lift is a must for me.,lamborghini
"I have tried both, recently bought an EVO AWD. If carplay is that important to you, get the EVO, best carplay experience I've ever had. Totally different than the aftermarket 610 version which you won't even have touch screen...

That aside, you'd notice AWS and EVO feels to me more planted to the ground. Otherwise you won't feel much difference. EVO have a sexier butt tho.

2015 probably will hold their value if you can really find one low mileage for $150k but I doubt that. Typically for similar mileage they are about $50k apart not $100k. You feel EVO being more expensive that is because they have lower mileage.",lamborghini
I was going to block you because the photo and title was regarded.  This however saved it.,lamborghini
Im gonna get one this year,lamborghini
Lamborghini winter driving academy in Livigno. Was casually on my way to some skiing when I saw a large group of Lamborghinis drifting across a frozen lake.,lamborghini
Like a million dollar lambo,lamborghini

"Lexus owner here (I’m not lambo rich, or even sports car rich for that matter).  I’ve seen this in a few luxury vehicles and can explain why your tire pressure is triggered despite the fact that the reading is on par with others that are in a green range.  What happens is, especially during winter time, when it gets cold, a certain tire may have its pressure dip below a certain threshold.  When that happens, the indicator is triggered and tire pressure monitoring system will light up.  Even if the temperature rises and the tire pressure by such goes back to normal, the pressure light will not go away once the pressure has dipped into the warning region.  The only way to get rid of that light is to inflate your tire to a recommended pressure.  When that happens, most luxury vehicles will disable the warning light for that tire but the pressure *must* first be met.  For some older models, you may need to drive around for a few miles before the light sensor is reset.  Your recommended tire pressure should be located both on your tires as well as a sticker on the side of your drivers side door.  I hope this helps and…. Congratulations on being lambo successful in life.  That’s beyond a dream for some people.",lamborghini
Love the car but man those tire stickers are LOUD 🙄,lamborghini

"Because if I just said “I have an apartment there” it just sounds like it’s a normal apartment. 

The apartment price matters because you can buy a crazy house for that money, it’s the location. It’s saint Roman, 1300 SQ.",lamborghini

It looks kinda funky with the silver rims on satin black,lamborghini
"I’ve had 3 V10s and they all were bulletproof. I wouldn’t worry but you need to see the service records. If this car was not serviced religiously, look for another one. If it was serviced at A1 Budget Repair, run.",lamborghini
Stunning!,lamborghini
"Turns out the majority of people aren't into cars, but see something cool on the road and just wanna know what it is. They might know it's a Lamborghini which leads them here but not the specific model. Cars can be daunting if you know nothing about them 

The least you could do is be helpful, ""oh its an X"" and move on with your day. Wanting them banned? You sound like a child.",lamborghini
"Is this taking a Super Trofeo and making it street legal, or taking an EVO and making it into an STO, or what exactly is going on here?

Looks amazing either way.  Crazy cool.",lamborghini
"They probably would still do it if they're not too busy, worth asking. Also a good test for the dealership - if they don't want to have O'Gara inspect it, run away.",lamborghini
Love the Evo. When’d you get it?,lamborghini

"$291,671.00 for a high mileage Huracan.",lamborghini
Thank you!!,lamborghini
Don't think that's how that works. They can't force you to have a car services and just void warranties. Many people work on cars themselves (especially Porsche people) and have no problems.,lamborghini

You'd be raking it in that day.",lamborghini
"Sadly the STO and newer EVOs have the exhaust flaps closed, from the factory, under 4500 rpm. My buddy's STO is basically mute, compared to my Perf, unless he floors it.",lamborghini
That’s my dream right there. The color is stunning.,lamborghini
You can post these into Google and they tell you. It work well,lamborghini
Why would you lease a super car ? Unless the reason is you can’t actually afford it I guess idk,lamborghini
"I think the peak of modern day automotive design was 2016/2017. Everything was still simple with not that many forced lines and the design was still pure. The OG LP610, 991.1s, Pre Facelift Gen 2 R8s, 488s, and others looks simple yet elegant and doesn't look outdated today. 

The late 2010s-early 2020s (today) are heading towards the agressive ""Look at me"" kind of design though. I prefer the SV over the SVJ and Perfomante over the STO. And its not just Lamborghinis. F series BMWs looks miles better than the G series, the W205-era Mercedes looks better than the W206, Porsches too, and others. 

I know in today's world, making a statement is the norm. Thanks to the flexing culture and social media i guess. But i'm old schooled. I liked older cars better. Give me cars from 2005-2018 please. Loved those era.",lamborghini
Now that’s what I call a leanborghini,lamborghini
