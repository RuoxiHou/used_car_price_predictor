"I love it.

Mine is 1.2 TSI.

No issues (so far, at least). So I don't have anything significant to share, tbh.

Especially if we consider the fact that mine one is the older version. Mine (2012) is 2nd generation, yours (2021) is 4th generation. I imagine yours must include some ""new tech"" that is not in mine. No idea.

My only complaint is how small those cupholers are xD So difficult to find a proper mug for them.",skoda

Left hand drive or right hand drive country? Roads are designed to have a small angle towards the curb so it can flush the water from rain to the curb. I sometimes feel that on newly built roads instead of older ones. I drive a right hand drive car,skoda
Yes because the main fuses (and locks etc) of the big battery a used operated by the 12V system which ya need a battery for when you don't have the big one in operation.,skoda

Petrols are chain driven but that kind of chain that you need to replace too 


Both cars are ages away hah, I'll have a think :) I'm leaning towards diesel because of mpg, reliability and longevity. I wasn't really after 4x4 but I guess other than haldex and slightly lower economy it goes into pros rather than cons ",skoda

2 years ago I bought a 75k km Superb 2018 L&K with the same engine in Czechia at the exact same price. Is it a bad deal? No. Is it a good deal? Also no. It's a deal at a market price imho. Depends on the overall state of the car and how it's been looked after.,skoda
"Start stop might be off, bc the batterie is to low. Maybe the previous owner only drove short distances. Just drive a bit longer, let the batterie get loaded and it will work. At least that is what happened to me. I bought an Octi RS 3 with same mileage. To be honest, after driving it for 2 years, i programmed it out. Its useless and you fuck your engine and your gearbox, bc 1. the motor has to shut down and start over and over again and 2. if you dont want it to be shut down, you cant get in neutral while holding on a redline e.g. this is fucking your gearbox.",skoda

Stage 1 usually requires just more regular plug changes and nothing else.,skoda
"The question is why you have a hybrid when you only charge 1 time per week, at a public charging station, with probably a high price per kW. Then drive around 6 days with a big xxx kg battery. You should go petrol (with your mileage) until you get availability to charge every day.",skoda
"I know exactly what you mean about availability and costs. 

I don’t know if a 4x4 version of the RS was released in Australia. It’s a car with a lot of configurations and variations. If they do exist in Australia, I have never seen one. 

I also know about the redriven video you speak of as that one of the videos I watched as well! I’m also based in Australia but not TAS. 

My used RS had 89k kms on it when purchased. 
My only piece of advice is do you research. I probably went a bit OTT with the research, and the redriven video didn’t help lol but they like to list EVERYTHING that could or might go wrong with any car they review. 
Yes there are reports of parts failing (water pump, thermostat housing, wheel bearing) but there are also just as many happy customers that have had their vehicle for over 150k kms with nothing to go wrong. 

yes it’s a good idea to set some money aside just in case, I did the same but not 10k worth. 
I’ve purchased new front tyres because the ones that came on the car were cheap and had a lot of road noise. 
I also had a slow leak in the upper timing case fixed ( cost a bit under $1500). 
And I had a rattle in the door fixed by an independent Skoda specialist. 
All of those were known issues when purchasing and also helped my case when it came time to discuss the final purchase price with the seller. 

I also purchased a OBD11 which will cost you about $100 or so, maybe a bit more. That will allow you to diagnose things yourself without having a mechanic charge you crazy amounts of money just to scan your car. 
I also have some money set aside just in case something catastrophic goes wrong, and aim to keep costs down by doing some work myself. 

From what I found, if you’re willing to do your research on the kind of car you’re purchasing you’re going to save yourself a lot headaches and heartaches. 
There is also a wealth of information on YouTube and the Briskoda owners forum which has helped me diagnose and fix the sunroof draining issue already (known issue when purchasing). 
Doing your research about these known issues will help your future headaches. 

I checked out 3 or 4 RS’s in person and I was serious about all of them. Once I checked it out in person I arranged a pre purchase inspection. Some of them came back rather questionable, which was also news to the owner! 
Sometimes owners can be oblivious to issues that are under the bonnet of the car - sometimes major sometimes minor. 

If you’re buying new, you won’t have to worry too much about the above comment as it’s under warranty - and Skoda Aus have a deal for 7 year warranty at the moment I think - unless that’s just my local Skoda dealer. 
If purchasing used, it’s cost effective to purchase a used car service pack, which won’t cover you for warranty claims if parts fail but it spreads out your servicing costs for your major and minor services. 

Owning a car like this requires a different mindset to the one we have culturally here is AUS. Aussies have been born and raised on fords, holdens, Toyotas, Hondas and Mazdas. 
Assies think a car should just go without thinking about care and maintenance. No fuss, no hassles, no bullshit. 
Car ownership is no longer like that (I believe, anyway). 
Things can go wrong at any moment with any brand of car. 

Owning a VAG product requires you to ‘enter into a relationship’ with a car like a Skoda (as my pre purchase inspection mechanic put it). 
Cars take time, attention and care. 
If you look after it, it will look after you. 


There’s lots I could say but don’t want to ramble on too much. 
I’m also on mobile so my responses aren’t  that great at the moment. 

If, after all this research and thought, you’re still keen on owning an Octavia RS then I highly encourage you to join the club. It’s a fantastic car to drive.",skoda
"850km sounds normal, so the fuel gauge is off by software. Look into how to reset this.",skoda
"Have you tried different music app? If you don’t have subscription, just try Podcasts. Download several music podcasts and switch between them, see what happens. Also, 2021 Octavia had a shitty multimedia software. Current version is 1941 and is quite good. I’d say go to a skoda service and have the multimedia updated. Also online communication unit, otherwise you won’t get online updates for multimedia after 1941.",skoda

You guys should check your infotainment SW version. I assume Bolero/Columbus device in Style trim? They've fixed a lot of issues with SW ver. 1941.,skoda

It might just need a bit of a clean.
Equally, the B7 passat probably has the same parcel shelf, but I can't say with any certainty that it does, but the photo you posted looks very similar to my B6 Passat parcel shelf, so, I'd hedge my bets",skoda
It's from a private owner. I enjoy driving and don't abuse my cars. My previous car was a octavia 3 rs tdi and didn't have any issues with it.,skoda
"it is possible to do this through the battery management screen on the infotainment no problem - however keep in mind that overnight (depending on weather conditions) the battery will 'leak' charge so it won't last the full 60km if you only intend to charge it once a week.

Having said that, on longer drives, even without charging the efficiency is pretty good. On a long drive I average 5 - 5.5 l/100km (motorway driving) with around  8 l/100km in city driving. But yes, if you charge the battery while driving - there's no point, as it almost doubles fuel consumption.

I bought mine second hand and given the relatively minimal price difference bewtween the solely petrol version and the PHEV version it was absolutely worth it in my opinion.",skoda
"Thanks. 

They all seem to be £160 or so and hoping to see if I can pick one up a bit cheaper. Thanks.",skoda
"Thanks. Got a rough price idea on timing belt change, if it's loads I'd need to look for one that's had it done as they'll likely all be over 6yrs for me?

Do they have heated windscreens or parking sensors? I'm getting mixed results looking online so guessing they may be optional extras.",skoda
Diesel and gasoline cars nowadays have nearly the same consumption. 90% of the time I would choose gasoline since diesels have gotten quite complex with emissions equipment. Some countries (like Finland where I'm from) diesel is about the same price as gasoline and annual roadtax is much higher.,skoda

"I wouldn't use the ""rubber spider"" 😊 securing a load onto the roof-rails either.

"What's your current mileage ?

Break pads needs to be worn in, depending on the mileage could also be unaligned properly.

"Of course you could do that but I figured it might get expensive. I mean a power strut is around 400€ and a power latch/lock around 200. Parts replacement for testing is an accepted way of diagnosing problems but that should come as a last resort, when nothing else works. One of the reasons i said the problem could be tricky is because both components are known to fail. Power struts fail at the wiring (you don’t know which one and if you do repairing by soldering is just temporary because wiring is flexing each time you open the tailgate), also inside power strut is a simple but and screw mechanism that could fail due to mechanical wear. The powerlatch is also known to fail at the switches I was talking about earlier.",skoda

"You guys are forgetting that consumption is affected by driving conditions and driving style.  
I have karoq 2.0tdi 4x4 and the consumption is spot on.

Even when driving more agressively its stays at around 6.  With that said, it can also easily drink 8 - 9 l/100km with heavy foot.

Its not always about ""driving slow"". Do you accelerate swiftly ? Do you coast whenever suitable? Do you overtake other cars often? How far and what terrain do  you take? Are your tires properly inflated? Do you drive alone?  You get different consumption when driving in town all day compared to mixed roads or highways...",skoda

"Brake disks and pads or drum brakes? Either way you can confirm it’s the rear by gently applying handbrake (careful where and when you do that, have the handbrake button pressed at all times so you can disengage it immediately; maybe an empty parking lot is a good place to do it). Anyway I suggest having the brakes inspected/serviced by a professional.",skoda

"Yes, it is complately normal.

Diesel cars act complately different in rev chart.

For example if your petrol car is able to go with 130km/h in 5th gear 4000revs, diesel do it in 2400revs 5th gear. 

So 4500revs is okay, and you shouldnt drive your car as petrol. Gear changes should happen in lower rpm-s under 2500rpm max.",skoda

It's not a problem. But because your led lights are bright white the halogen lights seem more yellow. That's why,skoda

Shocking,skoda
Just for fun maybe get a buddy to connect his different brand android to your car to see if its car or phone related,skoda
Lower control arm are usually the easiest with shark-hooks / J-hooks. Rims are a good option with straps too. If wheels are in gear/locked then with skid blocks under those wheels.,skoda
For sure. RS has almost the same engine with 185hp so it’s safe and you will consume less fuel and have more fun driving. I also have the 2.0 TDI with 150hp and will get stage 1 done when my warranty ends.,skoda
Nice. I'm planning to do the revisions at max 10k kilometers.,skoda
"Engine? Great colour! I own a Octavia blue race colour and I love it.

Yes, too much expensive. In Portugal, cars are expensive as well. Government needs money... And can't compare the wages Nor Vs Por",skoda
"no, I do not mean speed limit indicator and it is standard Skoda function. I know what I have. Notice about the camera comes to infotainment screen and there is option either press OK or press to show the camera on navi. It is standard functionality, just need a way to turn it off.",skoda
What an awesome build!,skoda
"Octavia driver but mine is very sensitive to any road incline. Since most roads here have a light incline to the right, my Octavia will slightly move to the right also.

One braking from 180 to 80 kmh and the brakes went noisy. Two persons and one luggage on the board. Sorry no...,skoda
"Would absolutely love to, just a bit too far out of my price range!",skoda
with the dsg and mhev extra i haven't noticed a turbo lag. maybe on manuals is much more noticeable. but in terms of gas mileage the 1.5 is much better engine,skoda
"Yes that's exactly what I did, got a RCD330 for my Yeti. It struggled a little to start, but it eventually did after 3 tries.
I think the main issue is my daily commute is very short (8km/5miles to and back) so I charge my battery regularly to compensate and when I installed it I haven't charged it in a while.

Car wise a 2011 with only 50k on it needs a check because it's been driven so little.

  
Is it a good idea? Are you going to do your own mainteance? Or do you have a VW service partner that doesn't mind taking on a bit of a challenge? Is it on the market in nearby countries? That could help with parts.

I would never tune a car because of those experinces, especially on a machine that I need to work reliably. Perhaps one day I'll tune my GSX-S1000 after an exhaust swap but that's it. Even then it'll be a reversible procedure with a power commander module. It's totally irrational, but I would love that Akrapović sound on it.",skoda

"I believe the 1.8 it has 6 gears and it has the DQ250 gearbox that does need an oil change, as someone else said it is a wet clutch that is submersed in the oil.

What you guys always miss is that those cars i post are from official skoda partners they don’t screw around they check every car because they sell them with a one year warranty,skoda
"Ateca ended up being too small to future-proof myself, and ended up deciding on taking wagons off the list (resale after relocating, etc).

Will definitely revisit it after they redo the lineup with their own models in a few years, when it’s time to change cars.",skoda
I agreed,skoda
Was thinking about this aswell. You might be right. So it could be because of the combination of both? I guess i will eventually get used to it,skoda

The tuning was done at APR I belive if you read the first line Stage 1 APR. 

For now the car is very fast for me coming from an Octavia 3 RS TDI with 184 hp. 

I will enjoy the car and will definitely take it on the bends in the weekend. I know an awesome road that takes you from Bucharest to Calarasi at the Danube river, but you have to take the alternate road, not the A2 Highway.",skoda
I agree 😊,skoda
"I had read about the lousy upholstery work, but damn... Those seats look wrong.",skoda
I use eco mode(coasting) for 90% of my drives. With the 2.0 tdi I get better consumption than 1.6. The wltp is extreme driving to hit that.,skoda

Well at least thats what i experienced and a mechanic explained to me that the system wouldnt shut the motor down when there is not enough energy. Its a safety mechanism for that your battery runs low because of multiple starts and stops and not enough charging of the battery for example when in high traffic in the city.,skoda
Sent a DM with town,skoda
Thanks. I’m hoping it’s nothing serious! I have seen the start stop error before when it was super cold weather. It was just the EPC light that’s made me worried!,skoda

On the DQ250 the peak torque of the 140kW variant engine is software limited to 350Nm in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th gear, because out of the factory this older box was not designed for the 400Nm torque.

Just note that Injectors need to be changed at 100k if I recall for diesel, for TSI I dont know, but they are cheaper.

I would personally avoid 100k cars.

125 or 75 are OK, but 100k is a milestone.",skoda
Is the problem that they keep failing and they've run out of them?,skoda
"This usually means that you are either driving it for too short distances, or not driving it often enough. For the latter, a battery trickle charger is advised. I avoid this by taking it out every weekend for a longer drive.",skoda

Same with pulling towards, but speed increases. 

Hope this wasn't too hard explanation. This is based on my observations on my mk3",skoda

To my knowledge the location and number of sensors varies depending on which climate system your car is equipped with.,skoda
"If it’s a well done Stage 1, all that means is the car’s potential that it already has within its coding has been increased, meaning that next to no other modifications need to be done for the car to reliably handle the power increase. Of course, that’s given it’s been done properly and not just flashed on. Personally I wouldn’t be too happy if I bought a car that I didn’t know had a flash map on it; if it’s been dyno’d then I’d be very happy.",skoda

It’s great car for family back seats have so much room and it’s really safe car I have worked on many crashed cars and kodiaqs are in my top 10 of safest cars and also it’s great for kids because of those plastic pieces on doors so they won’t damage your car and everyone parking next to you plus that 220V outlet in the back can power small TVs or laptops if you are planning on taking your kids on longer drives.,skoda

Meh,skoda
"The 1.2 TSI with either 86hp or 105hp is a reliable engine contrary to what people say on the internet. Keep in mind that this engine has a timing chain which can be faulty because back then VW used low quality parts which was changed a while later (around the time you mentioned should be safe tho).

Especially the 105hp version has a great mix between enough hp and fuel consumption. I never had another gasoline engine which a lower fuel consumption tbh.",skoda
I have the 2021 ambition but the wireless CarPlay works fine for me,skoda
Wipers have been removed and tested with other ones as well as the wiper lever/ switch next to the steering wheel. The cable/wire ends that connect with the front wipers have no power going through them.,skoda
Since you seem knowledgeable 😉 do you also know where the indoor temperature sensor is? That's also something I've always wondered...,skoda
"If he used it as tuned race car, it has better stats now, but also more worn out part, so in fact, new owner might be forced to do big maintanance...

Minus point to OP... if you are not aggresive driver, dont take RS model, there is always huge change, they were driven hard",skoda

Car has 110kw and is very lightweight and fast for my needs. Engine is great in terms of reliability and fuel consumption. Also superb is heavier so consumption will be higher and acceleration not as good as octavia.  As any car in VW group, they are not as comfy as french cars in my opinion. For my back, any trip longer that 2h is pain, so I can not help you with that.",skoda
I have the same tyre pressures written. Ride was like a carriage in far west. Now are 2.3 front and back,skoda

You mean stopping engine in traffic lights while you wait and turn it on when you press gas?,skoda
"TSI 95 HP, is it correct in english? I hope 😆",skoda
It will not show the name of the person who calls in the virtual cockpit display.,skoda
I have the Scala Se with the 1.5 Tsi engine (Manual) and it's great on the motorway. Makes the car feel really composed. It's more than enough power and very economical. If you are planning longish trips with family and luggage it's a good option.,skoda
That's pressure because of fuel consumption. For your comfort and durability of suspension. Inflate front and rear to 2.3. Noticeable better ride quality,skoda
"Pulling towards always increases by 1, pressing end button should decrease by 1 (once speed is set, as you correctly said), but it sometimes decreases by completely random amounts (5, 15, 30, anything really). Not sure what you mean by speed delta and tolerance",skoda

Thanks but I don't think that's it.  I'm fairly good at keeping keys dry and not dropping.  I was driving the car and couldn't lock it remotely with the fob when I noticed it first.  My trust is rapidly dwindling in this motor but maybe all new cars are problematic though.,skoda

I stand by my Electronic Diff and DSG comments though!",skoda
"If fuel efficiency was a consideration you could have gone for a greenline or 1.6tdi, around 560miles (900km) to a tank. Mine averages over 55mpg and on long motorway commutes can hit over 90mpg (38kmpl).

Maybe when you get a bit older 😄",skoda
So in summary a DSG is alot more comfortable and responsive :D niiiiiceeee,skoda
"Michelin Energy Saver are quiet and efficient, last very long. Not exceptionally grippy of course, you can't have both.",skoda
"They also sell a lot to fleets, and on a typical 3 year replacement cycle for a fleet operator, they'll only need to service it once, which makes their numbers look good.

Sometimes with looking at what the same manufacturer with the same engine in the same model recommend in other markets. 

E.g. USA market often recommends more frequent service intervals, and if anything the driving style there should be kinder on oil (longer distances, fewer short runs etc )",skoda
3800 kms. I have seen it from Day 1 as that sound comes only once when I move vehicle from overnight idle condition,skoda
1.0 is a good engine with good power output for that car. The 1.5 tsi will be a blessing for a car that small. It will be fast and it should get good mileage.,skoda

"I drive 2021 Octavia 2.0 TDI with matrix lights. Matrix lights are absolutely awesome and I would choose them any time in any car.

If I were you I'd go for the benzin version despite no matrix.",skoda
Do you think car paint is invincible object? For now you wait and respray it later or use colour marker for now. But in future you need to wrap your front to prevent damage on your car paint,skoda
"There's also a minimum speed limit, which allows you to creep as long as you want, and to crush tall grass when parking.",skoda

"It makes a difference. But only if you have long journeys and use it all the time, and drive conservatively.

I drive around 40 miles to work, and most of it is dual carriageway and motorways. I kick it into eco when I leave the house, and as soon as I hit a long stretch of road, I put my Adaptive Cruise Control on and I barely touch the pedal again for 40 minutes unless I really have to. Otherwise, I let the car brake and accelerate, etc.

I have a 1.5 tsi also. A full to the brim tank will hold 70 litres, give or take. And normally, I'll get around 530 miles out of it from normal driving as long as I'm not booting it everywhere. With the Eco and ACC on, I'm able to stretch that out to around 630/640. So, another 100 miles is great in fuel/moneys terms.",skoda

Prev owner put a new clutch before selling, I've only had to change the steering wheel clock ring, turbo actuator, front discs, timing belt, tensioners and water pump - generous estimate of 1k GBP on parts/fluids, do all my own work. If I only do town routes below 40mph then the DPF does start to clog and the light comes on to tell me to take it for a longer and faster journey, occurs every two-three months if it is only being used to pop to the shops and back. One thing I love about it is the fairly straightforward servicing, for a couple of years it only needed oil changes and filters.

It will do what you are looking for but if parts are not easily available I'd stay away.

If I understand correctly you want to upgrade to wireless SmartLink (Skoda's name for AA and CarPlay functionality) on your Octavia. Some cars have the option to buy this functionality. You should ask your nearby Skoda dealer if your head unit is eligible for this purchase/upgrade.

Whoops! Not sure where I heard about the 6 being a dry clutch then, thank you for the correction!

Cheers for your help though, I think the 245 is definitely the right option for me!

> Finally, I assume from your post you are choosing the Wagon variant, which is of course the only correct option.

Oh yes, a wagon is the only choice for me, and anyone sensible ;) I know I would miss having the extra space, especially after how useful the Scooby wagon has been over the last 10 years!

> The only *disadvantage* I can see would be that you have to take the 19"" wheels due to the bigger brakes on the 245. I had these as a factory option on my vRS and whilst they looked nice, they did add a bit of harshness and noise to the ride and due to the low profile they were super-easy to curb or chip!

I'll have to have a better look into the wheel sizes, as it seems quite a few 245's here in the UK are being advertised with the 18"" wheels. To be honest, I prefer the 18"" wheel style anyway, so it doesn't really make a difference for me.",skoda

I have driven the 220ps petrol engine and being honest preferred the power delivery in that, I bet there’s not much in the real world in terms of running costs factoring in the cheaper petrol price too.

On the 4x4 you need haldex servicing every 40k miles and assuming it’s dsg which has the same 40k service interval, extra costs to factor in. I believe the 190tdi without 4x4 is also cheaper to road tax annoyingly.",skoda

"Hey! Firstly, I can tell you are a smart person as you are choosing the far superior body type in a vehicle- the wagon. 

I went through the same car selection process (looked at the other cars on the list) as you and also had similar criteria (musician but like to drive. I also have two kids and I like to take to family on a cruise sometimes). 
I also looked at the Mazda 6 wagon if that’s available where you live.  

I ended up buying a used 2016 Octavia RS wagon and absolutely love it. 
Managed to get one with two services left in the service plan so double win there. It’s only been a few months (bought in Dec 2023) but loving it so far. 

There’s a lot to consider when buying a car like this but to answer your question specifically about how it goes on gravel. 
Because it’s a front wheel drive with a fair bit of power you will get a fair bit wheel spin if you are trying to go uphill on gravel. 
Well, at least I did anyway when I took the car to a camping spot that was accessible only by gravel road and was up a steep hill with the back full of camping gear. 
I had to go slow as it was near pedestrians and a shared walking space. There was a fair bit of wheel spin and took a lot of care going up. 

That’s probably the only time when using the car that I felt it was operating a bit too far out of its comfort zone. 
If the roads were flat it would have been fine. 

If this is a major criteria for you, then I would maybe consider the Octavia Scout if AWD is a necessity.",skoda

"Yeah, maybe that‘s the way to go. I was a bit in a hurry, so I just insulated the faulty wires with electrical tape.

One thing I noticed: there are two very thin brown/green wires coming out of a single pin. One of them had a scratched insulation, but the copper was intact. The other one was cut through about 5 cm from the connector, but I didn’t find its counterpart. The rubber thingy is extremely annoying when working in such tight spaces, so maybe I should unpin the whole connector, remove the rubber and ring through all wires to see what is missing.

Current symptoms:

- Lock sometimes doesn’t open when using the key fob 

- window lifter is stuttering when moving up. This could also be a faulty lifter motor or excessive friction, but the window lifts properly when doing the „learning“ procedure by turning and holding the door key, so I wanted to sort out any wiring issues first.",skoda

"I own a 2018 Superb and following are my recommendations : Automatic DSG transmission needs to have oil changed max every 60k km. At this mileage, the DSG will be at ~1/3rd of its lifespan since they usually last 250-300k km based on maintance. If you cannot validate that the DSG oil has been changed regularly, don't touch the car. The same as above if it has a 4x4 drive. If you don't change oil in the Haldex system every 60k it will get stuck and you lose the 4x4. Not a cheap fix. If it's a TDI then it will have a particulate filter which might need changing later on. Can be a 2k EUR repair. If it has the adaptive suspension DCC the dampers are a toast after max ~150k km. One adaptive damper costs around 500 EUR EACH. So again can be a 2.5k repair easily. Normal non-DCC dampers are 60-80 EUR each though. The timing belt should be replaced at around 150k km. It has a lifespan of around 210k km on paper, but can blow up way before. If the timing belt and water pump haven't been changed yet, if you do buy the car, do it anyway! If the timing belt breaks, the engine is scrap. The factory water pump often glitches on newer VW TDIs (happened on mine too - water pump sporadically malfunctioned and engine started to overheat on the highway - happened once and never again) and can cause the engine to overheat sporadically. Change it, it's a cheap fix when you're already doing a timing belt replacement. The lightly colored interior version tends to attract dirt and needs a good amount of care to keep it in good condition. Other than the above, Superb is an extremely reliable car, sexy, and vulgarly spacious car that can easily last 100s of thousands of km if it was maintained properly.",skoda

"If you don't need the extra space, the Octavia is the better car.

The Ocativia is a little lighter, in my opinion much sportier (possibly with a little less comfort, because it's designed to be a little sportier), it's better in cities because it's a little smaller than the Superb, and it's a) faster with the same engine, and b) it consumes a little less with a balanced driving style.

But when it comes to the seats, I would bear in mind that leather seats can really be hell, especially in warmer climates, and the fabric upholstery lasts forever, it's pure VW quality, they still look like new after 10 years; I would only opt for leather if you're taking children and/or a pet, such as a dog, because dog hair, for example, is virtually impossible to remove 100% from the fabric seats.

"Great choice, I have got a 2019 in Elegance trim and wind noise and pothole comfort aside, a magnificent vehicle. Now, if you have the DSG automatic, do watch how much you manually shift since the box does tend to learn on its own and get more aggressive with your aggression. The 2020 model refresh is sensitive enough as if you switch down a couple times on the highway to overtake, it will take a week for it to calm back down. It will be more agressive to the point of losing comfortable gear switches. Also, someone more knowledgeable can correct me but I can't imagine this being good for the clutches. That being said, oil more frequently, 10k I would do on either petrol or diesel. The factory interval is really for best case scenarios, if you are in nice warm dry climate year round, it's probably fine. You can only help the engine by changing the oil in more frequent intervals. Same goes for other fluids, if you live in, let's say northern Europe or thereabouts, do have brake fluid tested at least once a year for moisture. Also, as said, clean off salt if applicable, Škoda paintwork is good, but not that good. Especially keep an eye on the underbody if you live in the salting area of Europe.

Other than that, the 1.5 is a great engine! 1.4 before that, not so much. Rough idles and turbo issues are what I heard.

But that'll use the petrol engine to charge the battery and make the fuel efficiency terrible. It'll still use both the petrol and electric engine.

You can charge the car at a normal electric socket. It'll take 5.5 hours but it'll work. Unfortunately using a wallbox is not much faster (3.5 hours at best).",skoda

"DSG gearboxes are great, but you absolutely *must* follow their maintenance schedule. At around 40k km (check the manual for your specific car) it will need a fluid change, and at the same regular interval thereafter. Failure to do so could be a very expensive mistake, as DSG gearboxes are prone to failure if not maintained and are very expensive to replace. Thankfully (at least in the UK) VW group have a very reasonable, flat fee for gearbox service.

Also re your question in another thread about whether DSG feels like an automatic. Mostly, yes, but there are a few subtle differences:

* DSG gearboxes do not always creep in the same way an automatic does (i.e. when you lift off the brake in a standard automatic, it begins creeping forwards). Some models have added this in software, but you might have to get used to auto-hold brake and then accelerator to get it to move.
* DSG gearboxes are very responsive, if you use manual mode you should be able to change gears as fast or faster than a manual
* DSG gearboxes don't ""slip"" like an automatic. In many traditional automatics, when you accelerate the revs will rise before the speed rises, because the wheels are not directly connected to the engine (there are many examples, especially with modern automatics, of locking torque converts that *do* mean the wheels and engine become directly connected). With a DSG, like a manual, when you put your foot down the revs rise in-line with your speed.",skoda

If that’s the case the tailgate will stop moving. Also the struts could be faulty, the wiring could fail and one of the struts travel sensors could report a faulty value. Also this will stop the tailgate. 
You need a tester to verify the faults in the address 6D (tailgate electronics). If you find faults regarding power struts position sensors, well, you know what to do. If you don’t find such a fault, you have to see tailgate lock measured values in the same address. If the values don’t match, the closing latch/lock is at fault.",skoda

"I can’t answer all your questions unfortunately. Because I’m not well versed in the diagnostics codes of the DQ200.  Because in my case the pump failed completely and catastrophically. So just like your situation it went out of gear, but it wasn’t sporadic, nothing could get the car back into drive. The clutches just wouldn’t close.

Because I'm not well versed in the diagnostic codes to do with the DSG (DQ200).

>would using the tiptronic system avoid the gear slipping:

Likely not, as it looks like something is wrong with your mechatronics unit, best case the pressure might be low because there isn't enough mechatronics fluid in the unit, and it just needs a top-up. Which a specialised DSG shop can do (despite it apparently being sealed for life). Worst case a high pressure fitting inside the mechatronics unit is broken.

The average lifespan of a DQ200 is rated to be around 300,000km acc. to VW. My mechatronics unit failed at 275,000km, and the clutch is still going at 350,000km. However DQ200 units made before mid-2013 are known to be problematic.

>How long would it take to open up the gearbox to see if it's wear and tear,

since what's going on most likely has to do with the mechatronics unit (that actuates the DSG) and is attached to the outside of the DSG transmission itself, it won't take all that long. 

>Is there any way to repair the wear and tear that's cheaper than replacing the whole gearbox:

Yes, you can simply change the mechatronics unit with a new/refurbished unit, or have yours refurbished. However most Skoda Dealerships are in way above their heads with this, the mechatronics unit will probably cost something in the range of 2000-3000€ direct from VW with installation (mine was around 2000€ back in 2019) and the DSG will need recalibration after the replacement. I would recommend TVS engineering or one of their local dealers for a quote.

Even if the entire gearbox needs replacement, you can get refurbished units through TVS.

>Can you install a wet gearbox system:

"Both the 6 speed and the 7 DSGs are wet clutch!

But yes - the 245 had the 7 speed which is the same as in my current 206kw Superb and is a better unit for both general and sporty driving IMO.

I also think the electronic diff is a really worthwhile improvement. I loved my 2016 Mk3 vRS wagon, but driving around NZ it was pretty easy to light up the front wheels in everyday driving and the resulting wheel-hop in the wet could get pretty annoying.

Roads conditions in Wales are similar to here - varying quality of surface, lots of rain and plenty of hills and b-roads where you would find yourself needing to quickly pull out into traffic from a hill/wet/poor surface. The Electronic front diff really helps with the traction and the propensity to hop/wiggle in these situations.

...then of course you have the general improvements to power and performance which are the icing on the cake!

I don't remember if DCC is also an option on the MK3 245, but this would also be a key difference and improvement worth having over the 230 if so.

Finally, I assume from your post you are choosing the Wagon variant, which is of course the only correct option.

The only \*disadvantage\* I can see would be that you have to take the 19"" wheels due to the bigger brakes on the 245. I had these as a factory option on my vRS and whilst they looked nice, they did add a  bit of harshness and noise to the ride and due to the low profile they were super-easy to curb or chip!

So for your use case I would definitely seek out the 245 if the wheel thing isn't a deal breaker!",skoda

5. Bought it 6 years ago, 100k km ago
6. I do the regular maintenance by the book, nothing more, or less, with an independent mechanic.

In these 6y / 100k, zero issues with the engine. Things that have gone wrong:

* Auxiliary heating (for freezing days) never worked, not worth fixing it
* Electric trunk. I had to replace the electric engine

and of course there is reguar maintenance (battery, timing belt, DSG, brakes, etc...) and a chip in the windshield and someone bumped into the rear bumper. But as hassle free as it gets.

**Overall: Super happy, I woud buy again.** If anything, I am bored with the car after these years, but it works as flawlessly and reliably as it could, zero reasons to change it.

The sits in the Karoq are making you stay more up right, this is also for the rear passengers. If you don’t have the vario flex option you can’t recline the backrest. The Karoq’s interior is designed in such a way that you have enough leg room in the back to feel comfortable but the sitting position is lower than other SUV’s, this proved to be an issue when using rear facing child sits and it will hit the front sit unless you slide it forward a lot and a 1.80 m person would not be comfortable. The interior feels better quality than the Octavia, steering wheal is the same, climate controls are the same unit from Octavia 3, DSG shift is also the one from the previous Superb, but overall it feels OK. Noise insulation is also better than the Octavia 3. On the technology side I’ve found it to be lacking, for me none of the sensors work like it should, matrix lights are constantly missing and I get flashes for blinding incoming trafic, whippers don’t start when they should, parking sensors are missing higher objects, rear camera has no guiding lines (only if you upgrade to highline camera), ACC is breaking when it shouldn’t, infotainment is from 2015, it’s basically the same that I’ve had on my Octavia 3 only connected and as a extras it has wireless Android Auto but some how AA works worse even by wire (it’s not using the entire screen available, it has a thick 1cm black bar at the top of the image that should be used, not a problem with Car Play)",skoda

VW apparently recently replaced their head of IT to try solve these, we've seen nothing yet.

Based on what I got from my dealer and my general experience:
- first 2kkm or so - drive gently, try avoiding sport mode in DSG (pushes the revs up), I'd avoid Eco driving mode as well for first 1kkm
- consider changing oil and filter after first 5-8 kkm

If it's well maintained and has a service history or lots of main dealer paperwork.....then 170K I wouldn't be too worried and hopefully coming at a good price. Hope this helps,skoda
Deactivates the interior movement sensors for your alarm. I think only for that one lock time. For when you want to leave your dog in the car ,skoda
"I would get a used petrol L&K Superb with 4wd & 280bhp. Very nice cruiser and adjustable suspension for comfort. I know it's not what you asked, but just a different opinion.

Or maybe an Octavia Scout for extra ground clearance, you can get one with the same tdi engine as vrs.",skoda
"Of course it's on warranty service, but the car has been out for 6 weeks now... It was a 2017 Kodiaq 2.0 TDi 4x4 140kW",skoda
Yeah I know but the info the person you were replying to gave is wrong so wanted to let you know.,skoda
no,skoda
Had an old 2005 tucson. Great motor.  I drove the crap out of it and it never let me down. Everything worked perfect.  The air con used to frost up the vents!!,skoda
Have you asked him?,skoda
"I get same feeling with Skoda Kushaq 1.0 MT, but that's only in the morning when I move the car 1st time. Rest of the time ok. It is very irritating especially when move from 1st gear to 2nd gear as if some part coming off. 😭",skoda
"Odd. Up and down should be 10 but that's odd what yours is doing. 

By delta I mean if you have set 85kph and someone in front of you drives 70,  that's delta of 10kph. Then say the tolerance is 10, and as current delta is 15, pressing end button sets speed to 70.

If you have set it to 85 but actual speed is 74, that's delta of 6 which is less than the (not confirmed) tolerance off 10, and pressing end button only drops it to 79.

Then ofc if you override the acc and speed up, say ACC is setin to 85 and you accelerate to 100 with pedal and then push the end button it sets it again to current speed, because the (assumed) tolerance of 10 has been exeeded.",skoda
"i have a mhev. what it does is shutting off the engine while cruising when you step your foot off the pedal and the car is coasting. something you can do with your manual is like cruising in inertia with the gearbox in neutral and the engine idling. this is what it does plus it shuts off the engine completely. the good part is you don't understand when the engine is off or when it wakes up. it is very smooth

if you get annoyed by it you can always switch the engine to sport mode and voilas! it forgets about ecology and the engine does engine brake changes gears a little bit higher than usual and it stays on during stops",skoda
.,skoda
"I hate ""suvs"" so easy choice for me.",skoda
"But I love my Scout :D just did springs replacement and the car looks like it has lift kit, old springs were done….",skoda
"I got a dsg and the engine temp gets most of the way to 90 while warming up. Then stops, drops a bit then after a couple mins it heads up to 90 and stays there. You reckon that's the dsg thermostat then?",skoda
That sucks. Perhaps they're cutting support for older models.,skoda
Probably.  The normal park distance control is already quite effective.,skoda
Better check belt then,skoda
"There is! Mine is by the driver side B pillar :)

And yeah it's great for locking yourself in and sleeping!",skoda
1.0 116 6 speed manual ..,skoda
YETU's ?!,skoda
Ignition coils in Octavia a4,skoda
"New battery will need to be coded after install. Well, at least that's what Skoda says.

Just had an original battery replaced for my 2018 Octavia. Battery died a couple of wks after a scheduled service.",skoda
Sometimes it can mistaken for the bumper fluid also so best to double check.,skoda
"Holy sheet. That's very neat. Would love to try it. Tks man, hope you have fun with those horses",skoda

"Yeah, I was thinking the same.

I was also thinking to buy the car after 4 years, as companies are movies towards electric and don’t know if any ice would be ordered then.",skoda
"Most of the Octavia 2 have AUX and it makes it quite easy to add Bluetooth dongle that is powered by USB and it uses the AUX for audio. I have Anker in my old Roomster and it has been working just fine for the last 10 years. One of the best upgrades I have done to it ever.

100 000 km for that engine is nothing as long as it has been serviced regularly and driven normally. It can take 100 000 more without any problems if you take care of it.",skoda
"a bit of double sided tape or velcro and stick it next to the USB port, if the car is anything like mine the USB port is switched, so when the car off and locked the USB port doesn't supply any power, and even if it did it'd draw such a low amount of current it'd take a few weeks to drain the battery, a dash cam would draw more current.",skoda
"Late MK4s with most of the issues ironed out are too close to the cost of new one. Outside of Europe so diesel isn’t an option, plus both those models are TSI-only now! 
Sad to see VAG kill off performance diesels :/",skoda
"The 1.0 TSI will be better for short trips and urban drives  when you will be forced to use 1st and 2nd gear a lot (frequent traffic light stops, traffic jams, junctions etc). It has less of a turbo lag than the 1.5 TSI.

The 1.5 TSI will be better for long journeys, and you won't have to drop down a gear to overtake.

I think the 1.5 TSI will be a better fit for you, but if it's offered choose the manual instead of the automatic.  It's more responsive to deliver the engine's power.",skoda
My fab vrs is currently on 205k and hasn’t wanted for anything in my 4 years and 50k miles of ownership,skoda
i drove a BMW x5 with dynamic drive active steering or whatever the f is called it didn't have this issue. older model with no such extra it was noticeable but not that annoying,skoda
"yeah, good point",skoda
"It didn't sound like it? It sounded like you were making excuses for why it was safe to use your phone, then said that using the radio was mote distracting and therefore fine to use the phone?",skoda
"Fidgeting your phone while driving is dangerous.  
Depending where you are located, you may have various laws for it, but in EU generally:  
- Texting while driving is illegal  
- Checking text messages while driving is illegal  
- Looking at your phone while driving is illegal  
- Using your phone for whatever reason is illegal

Modern cars can connect to your phone and you can talk over your phone without the need to hold it or look at it. Heck my 2012 Octavia 2 can do that, there is no excuse your's cannot, and it actually can, so use it. You are paying 20k+ euros for a car with features that exist on 12 year old cars.

I personally have my phone on a magnet because the 2012 nav system is slow as balls, but my phone is placed in a way which is outside my field of vision, and I DO NOT use it in such a way as to become a danger to others, when in need to text, I pull over, text, then resume the drive.

Please don't use your phone while driving.",skoda
"Yeah, you shouldn't be able to pull fault codes from Multimedia module, and see if there's any recurring faults. Might as well check and clear other modules while you are in with reader.

But this needs VCDS or OBDeleven specifically, generic readers can't get nearly all the info out the car.",skoda
You could always take out one of the plugs to see what it is,skoda
Thank you!!,skoda
"Sealed for life means it’s not recommended by VW and a Skoda garage won’t do the change. The fluids (mechatronics/gearbox oil) are separate in the DQ200 7spd Dry Clutch). It can still be done by a specialist, whether it has any benefit, idk. 

My DSG7 did 275,000km (175k mi) on the first mechatronics unit. Still got the original clutch at 350,000km.

With the wet clutch boxes, it’s an absolute must as the fluids are shared between the mechatronics and gearbox.",skoda
"If you are sensitive to the fuel price at your region, the Kodiaq RS will have worst fuel consumption especially when driving around city/town compared to the Octavia.

Personally I'll go for the Octavia RS mk4.5 once it's ready. But I am a bit biased because I've just ordered the mk4 to be collected next week :)",skoda
"If you change a battery in the remote 4 times in a short period, you didn't have 4 issues. It's the same issue.",skoda
"Legends thanks. Also, where’d you guys find this bulletin? Just so I know where to look next time instead of bugging everyone lol",skoda
What’s that haha ?,skoda
"It was below freezing a couple of nights ago, but since then it’s been above freezing. It was 4 degrees or below when I got in the car this morning because I got a warning when I turned it on. I will look into getting the gearbox and tranny oil changed. Thank you!",skoda
I can safely inform you that this is true for ANY engine 😁,skoda
You got example for rims,skoda
Check tire pressure on both sides. It might be that one of your tires on the left side has lower pressure than the ones on the right.,skoda
Remote is defective. Unfortunately you need a new key entirely.,skoda
"I have this exact colour but with different wheels and I absolutely love driving it.
The car looks amazing btw",skoda
