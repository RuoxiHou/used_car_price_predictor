"I've worked in a couple DRPs. I've worked in a couple dealer owned body shops. I've worked in a couple dealer owned body shops that had DRP affiliations.

Having a dealer's name on a body shop doesn't make the paint or body work any better. They're just as happy to use aftermarket and recycled parts as any other shop. All the techs attend the same ICAR trainings.

In fact, there are a few dealer-owned body shops in the area I'd actively recommend you not use, because they have some shitty techs and the shops themselves are ridiculously slow because of bad front office people. But I could never tell customers that. They'd take their cars there and then call me complaining that the repairs were bad. Of the four or five shops in the area I'd recommend, none of them were dealer shops. One was always a pain in the ass to work with, but they did great work.

The biggest difference is that dealer owned body shops share their profits with the dealer. If they're owned by a luxury dealer they'll charge more because they can. Two of the local german-owned shops were at $48/hour body labor while the rest of the area was still at $40. Why? Becuase ""reasons"". Their work wasn't better. They didn't work faster. They didn't even pay their techs more than the prevailing rate. They charged more because people expected to pay more at a german dealer than at some run-of-the-mill body shop.

Take your car where you want, though. If you're happy going to the dealer, don't let anyone stop you.

ETA: You're right that insurance companies establish DRPs to save money. But dealers aren't steering you to their body shops so that you get the best service and repair. They're doing it to make money.",Porsche

"If the delta was larger than $65k would you regret not buying the GT4? The GTS will depreciate. Based on sales over the past year including past few weeks; the GT4s are selling for basically MSRP if they‚Äôve been driven and over if they were garage queens. This is during a car market that as a whole has been softening. With the discontinuation of the GT4, and production around 2,500 units in NA market, the trend would suggest the GT4 prices will only continue to increase over time.",Porsche
Love to see one in Miami Blue.,Porsche

Well said and sounds like you're not as reactive as me. I should probably just see it for what it is and move on. Cheers!,Porsche
Man card? You'd need a nametag from the asylum to get into that thing willingly.,Porsche
I guess that exactly my point. The two different definitions is confusing.,Porsche
Sparingly from what I‚Äôm told.. I floated the idea to my dealership about a year ago and they never got an allocation. They had to trade allocations with another location apparently.,Porsche

"I‚Äôve had a 2011 Panamera Turbo for the last 8 years and loved it (except for the air suspension). It only had 20K miles when I bought it as a CPO. Now, too much failing rubber, plastic under the hood so moving to an M5 for something different for a few years.

"Also my daily.  Nice color - remember when brown was THE color for luxury cars?  The Risky Business 928.  Even Sheila E sang ‚Äúbig brown Mercedes sedan‚Ä¶‚Äù.  Have to admit I prefer our separated tail lamps better than the light bar now.  Ah well, progress‚Ä¶",Porsche

"I personally don‚Äôt like hybrids. I love electric cars and I love ICE cars but I don‚Äôt like the mix. 
Also I could imagine that the last non hybrid Turbo S could loose value slower.
However: the newest 911 has always been the best so the 992.2 will probably be better and my opinion sound silly once it‚Äôs out. 
Personally I would still get the 991.1",Porsche
"Sorry, to be clear i design the space and infrastructure for them to be installed.",Porsche
DougDeMuro just did a video about this car!,Porsche
"The overall experience of that car. The rawness, the sound, it's more race focused look. The 911 is faster, handles better but the GT4 was of an adventure driving. I have the option to build a 992.2 GTS but I honestly keep looking at a 4RS or even a 718 GT4 (mine was a 2016 981).",Porsche
This is Dark Blue Metallic,Porsche
"People have this odd fascination about critiquing others' taxpaying natures. It's how the system is setup, if I can legally exploit loopholes to maximise my spending power, then I absolutely will. 

I live in the UK though, so I'm just guessing what they are doing is legal through an offshore LLC. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong",Porsche

">the interior is significantly outdated, 99% of the time I use Apple CarPlay, how does it look? And did this make a difference to anyone?

This was a selling feature for me. I much prefer a classic interior with button than a giant Ipad glued to the dash.

>because this is effectively the last combustion engine model year in the 718, will it hold its value better in the future?

Yes, no, maybe? It's really hard to predict the future. However, the Cayman is currently one of the least depreciating cars on the market. 

I got mine about 2 months ago and I absolutely love it.",Porsche

"I wouldn‚Äôt say that they‚Äôre the best at what they do.. there are a few restomods out there that imo do it better.

"I have always wanted a 911 and for whatever reason did not get it. The wait is over for me, mine coming in 30 days. Buying a 911 is not like buying a car, its buying a dream & experience. Do it if you can because life is short. I had a Mercedes for the last 10 years and every time I got in it, it was something special. I can only imagine the 911 experience will be up a notch. Good luck",Porsche

"Well, a Panamera is closer to the soul, if there is such a thing, than a Cayenne is. But everyone‚Äôs circumstances are different. When my kids were small I got a Panamera as a compromise between the SUVs and a 911. Then when they got older I got a 911 :)",Porsche

"Gonna break it down as best as I can based on your responses here.

1. You said you like the interiors of the cayenne and panamera, but macans 19-21 are all older interiors with buttons. Not the touch that you see in panameras and cayennes in their current generation. This means you need to be looking at 22s or newer on the macan side.

2. You have a preference to the panamera. I am assuming that is because it is ‚Äúsporty‚Äù. For the macans, that means you need to be looking at S trims or higher to really start getting that sporty porsche feel. Same with the cayennes to get the upgraded suspensions. 

3. You talk about what mileage is too much. Aim for a cpo car around their major service cycles. In order to be cpo, that means they have to have done spark plugs, brake fluids, transmission fluids, and filters. This means you need to aim for around the 30k or 60k mileage range. 

4. Cost wise, I‚Äôd expect them to all be around the same ball park. The major difference is that the cayenne has a battery that cost 2-4k to replace. Panamera and macan being more like 600-800 bucks. 

I don‚Äôt think you can lease used. 

Based on all this, base panameras with some features on them and that mileage should be in the 50-60k cpo in the next few months for the older years (2017s/2018s).

Cayenne S and above easily above 65k

Macan S and above trims I believe 60 or above. I don‚Äôt track macans as much.",Porsche
$2000/sq ft I believe,Porsche
"They have. And different to what most people believe, roundabouts are not better in every situation whatsoever, which is probably why they don't have many. I once spent and afternoon going into this rabbithole, lol",Porsche

Why? Because PATRIOTISM. that‚Äôs why,Porsche
"Because a lot of experts are a saying that modern cars are not going to last as long as cars from 20 years ago.  People might keep a few special 911 models but they would only last 20+ years if they are stored, babied, and rarely driven.   Look at the new Mercedes compared to their older cars - total garbage.",Porsche
"For me, personally, I found that the typical/mainstream 911 is still too much for daily driving where I live (mostly 40 mph speed limits, heavy traffic, bad roads, ground clearance issues), but not enough for A-to-A driving (autocross, track, even rural B-roads), at least compared to a GT4 or Spyder etc.

I'm with the others: I want my second car to feel really special and be a huge event to drive. Practicality does not matter. As far as a fun but livable daily driver goes, a classic BMW 3er is a great choice (and that's what I have), or a modern GTI/Golf R, S3/RS3, M2/M3 etc.",Porsche
"Just trying to educate on EV's. Unfortunately, people think the ""charger"" actually does something when it's just a glorified extension cord. It's literally just a direct connection to the AC mains power, with a relay to prevent human shocks until plugged in. All the charging circuitry and power conversion is in the car. This is why you can have $200 mobile charger cords that only have a small electronics module which work identically to the wall mounted ones.

Please do explain how a charger could do this in a way that the vehicle was not expected to protect against.",Porsche

This is sick af,Porsche
"I think there's grip and stability handling vs fun handling. The GT4 handling is more on the fun side than grip handling side that GT3 have. I find the GT3 more intuitive in a point-and-shoot unflappable manner since the mid engine rear suspension is unstable. Never driven one with the rear end upgrades to decrease the dynamic toe changes though, I'd be curious what it's like.",Porsche

It‚Äôs reassuring to see individuals like yourself, are still proving to be successful within the field. Before starting this career path, I always thought there were  opportunities/avenues available for me after graduating, but now actually looking at it, I‚Äôve been beginning to doubt how far I could actually progress (within architectural industry) as I have personally not heard of many people progressing beyond a certain level/stage (for various career types within this industry).

"I have fond memories of riding in a 92A Cayenne Turbo S on a hot lap at Barber Motorsports Park.  We were chasing a 997 C4S and both cars were being driven by Porsche race drivers. Let me tell you, it was not getting away from us, cornering speed of the 911 was faster but it lost all of that gap on the straight bits.  Maybe the guy driving the 911 was sandbagging but it sure didn‚Äôt look like it.  I was absolutely blown away by how fast that Cayenne was in the right hands.",Porsche

A lot of people who have driven original targas point out some obvious flaws to the design: huge B pillar blind spot, large complex curve rear window that costs over $10k to replace that your insurance may fight you on (this has happened, search rennlist), buffeting. Look at 964 911s and earlier‚Äîlike for like a targa is the least valuable.  For 964s and earlier, except for special exceptions, valuation goes like this: sunroof coupe > coupe > cabrio > targa.

"Watch AMMO NYC's video(s) about chip repair. He does Porsches specifically and is very helpful. also r/autodetailing 

Research before you use and understand how you should fill the hole. There are kinda 3 levels of competence here:

1. Slosh some matching paint on the chip so it doesn't look like a shiny spot and won't rust. Not much technique required and probably not what a Porsche owner should do.
2. Fill the hole so that it looks reasonably good. This takes some work but is doable. Watch videos about this. Recommended. 
3. Fill the hole, wet sand and polish to get a very good result. This is scary but doable if you really want to have a good end result. More equipment needed or you can have a pro do it. I did this on my Audi and got good results but I went pretty far down the paint correction rabbit hole at the time. I don't regret it. but it does take some work.

"I understand why people are saying insurance first, however I would highly recommend talking to an attorney first to get guidance. (lemon law attorney specifically, even if it‚Äôs not a lemon law case, they‚Äôve likely dealt with many similar cases and many offer free consults) Once you file a claim to insurance, that claim is permanently seen by all insurance providers and will impact your future insurance rates even if you aren‚Äôt at fault, you cannot remove it. Whereas talking to an attorney first will allow you to understand if there are any other suits against Porsche with similar issues and outcomes in which case it may be very easy to get a settlement. (I went through something similar a while back with Audi and got a settlement) So in this sense, I was able to get a settlement outcome and my future insurance rates were not impacted because I didn‚Äôt file a claim. I also owed the attorney nothing if we didn‚Äôt get a settlement. Since we did he got paid a fee from the settlement in which we asked for a lot more than the value of the car to cover those fees. 

There is no risk seeking advice from an attorney, if anything you will come out more educated.

If the attorney advises you that your best bet is insurance because they don‚Äôt feel the outcome will be positive or worth the effort, only then go to insurance.",Porsche

It is cool that the dealer handled your situation well, but in either case insurance will handle the cost, this guy has just only reached out to the wrong people about it, repeatedly.

"If you like it you like it. Im not saying everyone hates it by any means. Im simply stating that I know firsthand it's not going to be in demand. 

I wouldn't say the Taycan is a flop, but it's far from a hit either. There are many sitting, their values are minus 30% or so after year 1. Trade in value is roughly 40% of msrp. 

The customers buying these cars dont come in asking for speed because that is cheap now. You can get speed anywhere for far less, they want value, history, sound, feel. Thats your average Porsche customer today, which is not the porsche customer of 5-10. years ago. 

Your average, and I mean average specc'd 911 is now roughly 170-180 new out the door. Im not sure these customers are concerned with maintenance.",Porsche

"it's illegal period. The simple fact that you got repairs at a non-manufacturer location or used aftermarket parts cannot void your warranty.

Should a later warranty claim arise, a denial must be made on the basis that the aftermarket part or service directly caused the failure. For example, if you replace a taillight with an aftermarket unit, the manufacturer can't then deny a warranty claim for a faulty headlight.

Now, replacing portions of the charging system for an electric vehicle is a little more intimately connected to the rest of how the vehicle operates, but the law still stands.

So first for compatibility it is simple, here‚Äôs what Porsche is saying about the bars:

Only in conjunction with the electric slide/tilt sunroof or electric slide/tilt glass sunroof available as a factory-fitted option (order no. 3FD/FE). Please note the information in the driver's manual.

So it is only possible to mount these on 911 with electric roofs. There is small hooks hidden under the joint that goes between the windshield and the start of the electric roof, ( search roof bars 991 on YouTube, they will show exactly how to pop them out and reach those hooks)

The bars are original bars from Porsche made and are specific for the 991, Porsche do not sell them anymore in EU but you can find them online as used easily.

But I guess thinking that means I apparently hate polar bears and want Earth to turn into Venus. Okay.

It's the same idea with California in the United States. Sure, sometimes they have good ideas and good intentions. In reality, most of the time it's just political grandstanding that results in pointless regs and stickers that are added to please the most populous state in the Union. All while everyone else who doesn't care what California thinks gets screwed with the higher prices companies levy on everyone to compensate.

You don't really want to add more stress to the front link and king pins, the arms aren't all that strong in bending, and there's a physical limitation to the number of leaves you can add to the front torsion bars.

In the rear, you have swing axles that are really just locating tubes around the axles. They're not very strong, and the shorter the arm, the greater the negative camber gain. The longer the arm, the lesser the negative camber gain. You need that camber gain to help counteract jacking forces.",Porsche

"I am no legal expert but a powertrain warranty or even a full bumper-to-bumper warranty isn't going to cover a car fire that burns a car like this. There are good odds this car gets totaled, a dealer isn't going to foot the bill for repairs that cost more than the payout for the value of the car, and PCNA isn't going to make them do it either. And that's even if it's due to a manufacturer defect and not road damage or critters chewing up wires. So insurance is your way to go in this scenario since they'll make the determination of cause and give you the money no matter what caused it. 

There are plenty of things that you should start off by seeing if it's covered under warranty like mechanical failures, but a car fire burning down a significant portion of the car is absolutely an insurance problem.",Porsche

The GT4 and GTS are both pretty spartan otherwise. My 992 GT3 is far more car than the GT4 was but albeit for double the price. 
My advice is get on Turo, rent each one for a weekend and let that be the deciding factor. 
The GT4 will get more attention than the GTS mostly due to the wing and the front splitter. But if you‚Äôre looking to be noticed the Porsche is really not the brand. $65k is a nice truck you can buy in addition to the GTS.",Porsche

"Unless multiple people come forth with testemony for now what i can see is that the charging port is the start of the fire. Either the charger melted cought fire and extended to the car or wiring inside the car near the charging port cougt on fire.

I can tell from experience that if the connection is imperfect it creates an arc. Now when dealing with a car charger that arc can cross larger distances and since under normal circumstances it can heat up that arc will heat more and any non thermal rezistant plastic will melt as well as caught on fire (since it is a peteoleum product). 

This can be prevented by fireproof plastic. I want to believe that carging would not start untill a secure connection is established (plugged in properly).

Op in this case i don't want to say it but my 0 proof, 0 experience, 0 context sais it is user error because it was not plugged well/smth wrong with the plug with a tiny part in porsche where they could have made it more fireproof near the charging port .",Porsche

"As a new owner of a custom 4S cab manual, I've got some what I hope are helpful opinions for you:

Strong recommend:
- **PDCC** is a must. It will improve both your handling and make the drive more comfortable. I'm so glad that I got it on mine. 
- Exclusive design taillights are sexy, and you can easily and cheaply also buy swap ins for the front turn signals as well. 
- For a cab, I highly recommend doing the leather seat backs (carbon fiber seat backs, painted, leather, etc...) Just one of those options. When the top is down it looks LOT nicer, and relatively speaking isn't too expensive.
- $420 for a leather key case is robbery. There's a ton of great aftermarket key protectors for a fraction of that cost. 
- Sun visors in leather is a waste of $. You'll never tell the difference. I know because I got them and now I realize how dumb it was to get those. 
- Same with the upper mirror panel UNLESS you specced deviated stiching with whole interior.
- Same with the cupholder trim. You're paying $300 for a 1x3 pieace of leather. I didn't get it and I'm glad because the default piece they put in it looks exactly the same as the leather. 
- The dash cam wiring is a scam. You're still going to have to buy the part and pay for installation. There are much better aftermarket cameras that you can mount yourself. 
- Putting red dials in is an odd choice for this build. If you're going to do that then at least get the red seat belts to match. But otherwise I would remove that. 


Possible:
- Gentian is a beautiful color, just be aware that getting it just a little bit dirty makes it look a LOT dirty. So be prepared to wash regularly.
- I regret not going with Club Truffle leather. With Gentian it would be spectacular, but then you'd also want to get a brown roof so that may be too far to go. 
- Without deviated stitching, the extended dashboard leather isn't much of an upgrade for a whole lot of money. I'd skip.
- I didn't go with the sport exterior package and dont regret it at all. 
- I question the high gloss black you're speccing with Gentian. There's not enough contrast to make it worth the high $, imo. High gloss black works best with bright colors like yellow, guards, shark, etc. 
- Adding deviated seat centers gives you a really nice custom look without much money spent. 


Good job:
- 18 way seats
- Premium package is a must
- Door lights
- Gas cap
- Front axle lift [a MUST esp with SPASM]
- Everything else I didn't mention. Good job!

It should exceed the original production safety standard and improve upon it with additional safety parameters.

One does not want to use insurance, in California, unless one absolutely has to.   I would just cover damages into the many thousands to my property (cars, houses, etc..) even though they weren't my fault...too many uninsured motorists in CA, no point in trying to get money out of an empty bag (however, if the tables are reversed, they sure want their empty bag filled with money).",Porsche

"I am well aware the cost of replacement, having PCCBs myself, but opting for steels on the chance that the car might be taken to the track is nonsense. OP said this will be a daily diver so I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre talking to the ether or didn't read the post.

PCCBs are a $9k option that costs $30k+ to retrofit OEM, or $15k+ aftermarket. If a track day did occur, new pads are going on regardless, so changing rotors is just one step further. The cost of a steel rotor set‚Ä¶ about $3,000.

Those PCCBs are going back on the car in the cases you mentioned because of their value, which proves my point regarding it being an ROI option; you could sell your PCCB rotors and pads the moment you take delivery and make a profit over what you paid as an option, including buying new steels. It‚Äôs a big plus to have spec‚Äôd on Porsches, and frankly would put buyers at ease to know those hadn‚Äôt seen the track.

If someone is buying a GT3 or RS that will live at a track then that line of thinking is fair, but given that budget of a track car, PCCBs last long enough (assuming diligent pad swaps and maintenance) and preform well enough to where just going with Surface Transformers for $15k/set isn‚Äôt that wild.",Porsche

If I were to do it again, I might also throw on PCCBs since the brake dust on the steelies is incredible. Also, if you're thinking alcantara, look into the non-GTS interior but then add the contrast stitching package. For about the same amount, you get a much nicer interior, apparently.",Porsche

The way that Porsche was able to make this SUV move like a sports car is the exact same wizardry that was used to make your cars so engaging to drive.

OP had the opportunity to record a professional driver driving one of Porsche's most advanced cars on a closed course, so of course he posts it on a Porsche forum for other Porsche enthusiasts to see.

We asked for a Porsche rental but the dealer refused and PCNA said they couldn‚Äôt do anything. So we had a Subaru which I personally enjoyed but my wife was used to sitting up higher.  At that time many car rental agencies had zero cars as well.

"That‚Äôs a shame to hear - thankfully, I have never been in an at-fault accident in 20 years of driving, and the last time someone else hit me was just a minor fender bender more than a decade ago and if I recall correctly, I just took the cash payout from Geico and did a CSL bumper for the car (E46 M3). I‚Äôm really just looking to be covered for catastrophic events and to satisfy the legal requirement haha.

"Only 17 GTRs were built, so this is a pretty rare car!  Have seen a couple for sale at Canepa over the years, but they rarely pop up (the GT and GTS were much more common... although still pretty uncommon).

The Spyder is by far the more special weekend car. It feels exotic, is sharper to drive, and has styling that draws attention unlike any 911. 

The 911 is more GT and is definitely the better daily driver. The automatic top alone makes it much more usable. Add in the extra softness in the chassis and you have a car that can be used every day.

My advice...don't buy it new from the dealer.  Find a car that someone else already took the depreciation hit or desperate to sell.  Don't be surprised when it depreciates even further, and expect the car to be considered Totaled after the 10-year mark as the batteries need replacing.",Porsche

"The 991 911 and 981 Cayman are much more closely related than you might think. If you haven‚Äôt already, watch this video which explains, in detail across 18minutes. 

https://youtu.be/z8RDTsr9POA?si=GrMay3A3Vh72THl2

As someone who has owned every generation of Boxster & Cayman, I once upgraded to a 992s and then 992 GTS. I was disappointed at the value compared to what I had bought previously and went back to the Cayman afterwards. Leaving out the lack of real exhaust noise in the later 992 and 718 cars, for everyday and track use, I would never recommend a 911 over a Cayman. Only if you must have a Turbo S or the latest and greatest infotainment does the 992 make any sense at all.

I‚Äôm currently driving a 981 GT4, heading to Spa for an open pit track day next week. Best thing is, I can cruise there and back in reasonable comfort, with luggage. Do 8 hours track time, and just swap my tires if I need to at the track. It‚Äôs the perfect car for me.",Porsche

"agree, 100% depends on your expectations. As a pleasure car with a noble engine and proper driving engagement, the GTS does the job very well. Under normal driving conditions, you won't be able to exploit the GT4 in a meaningful way.

But...if you plan to track it, or if attainement of owning a GT(insert number here) is prime to your motivation, then getting the GTS is a half way choice and will leave you frustrated. 

I can share my personal journey: I own a 911 GTS and could afford a GT3 (used, no allocation for me). So i asked myself what mattered to me:

- can i drive like a champ? no

- will i track it? no (you tell yourself you will but i struggle to find time to do groceries so...)

- what will be the main use case? Driving in the mountains to go hike / ski (i live in switzerland) with most likely my 4yo kid at the back, over the week end.

- will i drive it in winter? yes 1/3 of the time

- do I care for convertibles? absolute priority for me, I live for a wind made haircut and i want to hear the engine !!

Take care of porsches and they take care of you :)  Ive had no major issues with our fleet, but i also do my homework and dont blindly trust the dealers (like brake  jobs replacing everything - measure the parts, replace them when they are worn out..) also - no such thing as lifetime fluids - service stuff (aka transfercase fluids on the cayenne - its weakness).. and most important - its a porsche - it needs its exercise to stay fit, so warm it up and drive the crap out of it.. just make sure to give it some time to cool down (repeat) :)",Porsche

"True, also it's a Techart 997 Turbo",Porsche
"The 718 S is what got me hooked on Porsche in the first place. This was before the GTS 4.0s came out. 

The 4cyl engine is honestly amazing in a car that light. It sounds really good, mileage is great, its very peppy and quick, and the SoulPP aftermarket exhaust for it makes it sound even better. 

Sure the 4.0 has more power but that power doesnt come on until way higher in the RPM band due to no turbo. 

Test drive both on Turo. In my view, the 4.0 is not worth the price difference over the S in terms of pure driving experience. 

If your goal is a longer term store of value, those 4.0 engines will hold value WAY better due to everyone having such a hard-on for Porsche NA motors.",Porsche

Test drove the Panamera and we all knew it was the one. Sticker on a new one was a shock so we bought a 2020 CPO for $20k more than a new loaded Camry. No regrets and smiles everywhere when we ride together; kids love the soft close doors!

I‚Äôve never had a car with a wrap or put stickers on my car.  I think it‚Äôs tacky.  

That‚Äôs not political and if you had said that, I wouldn‚Äôt have commented on your post.

But your post was political.  The car owner didn‚Äôt post this as far as I know.  Someone else did and said that ‚Äú this is so sad‚Ä¶ if the owner is here, just don‚Äôt.‚Äù  In other words, he was seeking engagement criticizing the car owner.

Yet your post isn‚Äôt criticizing the OP or at least not primarily.  You give lip service to this shouldn‚Äôt be a forum for discussing politics and then proceed to criticize the car owner for his political beliefs- not the sacrilege of wrapping a Porsche.

You appear to have more of a problem with the car owner‚Äôs politics than with what he‚Äôs done to the car.

I point this out and actually list your attacks on GOP Maggot types and you claim I‚Äôm thick headed.  Look in the mirror.  You are what you claim to hate.  The first step to change is to admit you shouldn‚Äôt have been pulled into politics by the OP, who you believe to be a troll.",Porsche

No. It's more security for every car. The engine doesn't matter. The problem is manufactures building unsafe cars. Most modern cars have internet access and are vulnerable to attacks.

This may be why my previous post got a little bit of hate. The Porsche around here is a very common car even outside of the town of Palm Beach. Most are pretty base models at or around 100k. I can't leave my office without running into at least four or five of them.

There's a harness bar but no cage.

I ONLY want to pay my deductible, and it's hard asking customers to pay more than their deductible, but either the customer or the insurance company needs to pay for REQUIRED procedures per the manufacturer, the repair facility shouldn't have to.

My father just retired last year as head of Texas Instruments semiconductor production and logistics and FFS even as early as June 2020 he had suppliers telling TI they can't fill orders or partial orders due to raw materials and manufacturing shortages already.

"That‚Äôs a good point actually, I didn‚Äôt think of that. I read up on it earlier out of curiosity and this is what I got: 

Side skirts on performance cars like the GT3 serve more than just an aesthetic purpose. They play a crucial role in aerodynamics by helping to manage airflow around the vehicle. This can enhance stability at high speeds, reduce lift, and improve overall handling performance. So, while they do contribute to the car's visual appeal, their primary function is to optimise aerodynamic performance.

"Again it's not my opinion as im all set with the Porsches I have. Your average taycan customer has a household income of around 750K. These people have bought the car and dumped it. 

The values have been and will continue to go down. Book value on lets say a 130K Taycan 4s is now around 70K on a trade after 18 months. Thats a steep drop off. 

In regards to 718 vs 911 crowd. There was a good amount of crossover as 718 buyers in many cases had 1 or more 911's. Now your average 911 buyer is somewhere around the low 7 figure income mark vs what it was let's say 5-10 years ago. 

Also these aren't anecdotes for whatever its worth, and my sample size isn't a local dealers, its roughly 20-30 small-large dealerships. They are trying to jazz up interest but no bites as of today. Not to say tomorrow it won't be a hit. I just dont see it and data and industry knowledge does not back it up. Thats all. 

Also Porsche is not an enthusiast brand anymore. They are a luxury brand, any remnant of what I imagine we all came to love about the brand is quickly going away.

"I think all ICE Caymans will appreciate once the EV model comes out.  GT cars the most, then non-GT flat sixes, then 4-cyl.  

I'm not personally a huge fan of the 4-cyl Caymans, but I must say, on reddit there seems to be a fairly strong following of people who prefer the low-end torque of the 4-cyl cars over the generally-accepted better sounding flat sixes of the 987, 981, and 982 GT cars.

So, I honestly believe, over time, more and more people will pursue the 4-cyl 982's once they're out of production.  Just like air vs water-cooled 911s.  996s are cheap for other reasons, but 997s have shot up in value despite their water-cooled engines.

"The 911 SC was a model designation and was produced from 1978 - 1983.  It was available as a coupe, targa, or cabriolet.  In 1984, the 911 became the ""Carrera""; engine was upgraded from 3.0 liters to 3.2 and there were some cosmetic changes, which have been lost to history on this car.

The 930 is the turbo version.  I can't speak to RoW, but Porsche never sold a car badged with the ""930"" designation in the US.  Regardless, you can tell by the fenders this isn't one.

This looks like a standard issue 911 SC (based on your VIN decoding), with some aftermarket rocker panels and rear valence.  Just my opinion, but these are probably Strosek knockoff parts, because being over the top, Strosek built kits to use on widebody cars or turn a non-widebody into one.  

The thing to watch out for on these 3.0 engines is their tendency to break head studs.  You can drive with a couple broken, but eventually, you'll reach a point where you'll need a rebuild.  Also, like all Porsche air cooled motors, there's the question of valve guides, which were made out of substandard material.  Cars either have that issue or they don't.  I've seen them go in under 30k miles, but if they're still good after 50k, the engine's probably good for 200k miles.  So, unless you have an engine rebuild in your budget, I'd suggest a prepurchase inspection, with a leak down test, which will identify the valve guide issues.",Porsche

"I own a 981 Cayman S with PDK, and I'm wanting to upgrade my steering wheel from the standard Sport Design steering wheel to something from the 982/991.2 era. I'm a little confused about the different options because I am seeing a lot of variety with a lot of different claims about what cars they fit or came from. 

I see that there are all black wheels, silver on black, black on silver, spokes without the small bolts and ones with the small bolts, and apparently, I could order parts to make a silver on silver combo, even if it wasn't a factory option (I believe). I'm not sure if there are differences in wheel diameter, leather material, etc., which is where I really need clarification. 

I'm leaning towards a basic leather wheel (no carbon fiber, Alcantara or red 12 o'clock stripe or anything), and I like the cleaner look of not having the small bolt holes. It seems like the bolt holes were on the sports cars and the non-bolt holes wheels were on the Cayenne, Macan and Panamera, which is fine, but I don't know if it makes a difference in wheel diameter, grip girth, leather quality, etc. Some of the paddles look smaller/larger and have +/- on them, so I don't know if those will feel and click differently. 

It seems like if someone has a multifunction wheel then moving to a newer multifunction wheel can be done without issues, but if someone wants to add heated function or multifunction to their wheel when they had a basic wheel like mine, the Sport Design wheel, then they need to get an adapter like what GPSadapter offers and/or a clock spring.

"Have a 991.1 Targa GTS. Would not get a Targa again. For someone who loves to drive top down as much as possible, the wind noise is truly insane. You can't have a normal volume conversation with a passenger over 60 mph, and long distances in a highway will literally hurt my ears. Had a 718 boxster that was light-years better with wind noise, could do 85mph all day with no issues.

Also, the amount of time it takes to cycle the top is really inconvenient. Because you have to be fully stopped for about 20 seconds, it's always a gamble to cycle it at a stoplight.

I would get a cabriolet instead. Better wind noise, faster top, lighter weight.

Literally the only benefit of the Targa is it looks cool.",Porsche

Manufacturers cut corners by not implementing working security measures in their cars, leading to things like range rovers for example having a theft rate of 994/100,000, that Kia boys shit happening, and everyone clowning Toronto police for saying people should leave car keys by the front door for people to steal.

Someone actually does something and gets manufacturers to stop cutting corners with security, to try and curb car theft, and everyone loses their mind saying it‚Äôs nanny state BS. Are you people actually ok in the head? Do you like getting fucked by corporation because they wanted to cut corners? It makes no sense.

"You don't need resin. The resin is used to make the carbon fiber fabric harden to its characteristic stiffness. Your trim pieces are still stiff. You are simply removing and adding clear coat.

I've done this for some carbon fiber bicycle handlebars. The bars were beautiful, but had obnoxious graphics and letters on them. I simply wet-sanded the clear coat off then the letters down to bare carbon fiber.

I can't recall the sequence of sandpaper that I used, but I was able to wet-sand them by hand in my garage in no time. I used sandpaper that I got from a local hardware store, nothing special. I then applied several layers of rattle-can clear coat and they turned out amazing.

I've never done car parts, but I'm confident that you can do this. It took me maybe 30-45 minutes of wet sanding to get the bars clean. The clear coat process took the longest because you have to add a coat, wait, add another, wait, etc... to keep drips from forming. That part might take hours.

">FIA certification of a cage requires a crash test FYI.

Absolutely not. 

There are 2 methods:
1. You build it to the regulation Appendix J 259. Respect the tube diameters, tube locations and thicknesses required. Send a welding sample and at your first event they certify it. This is how all National rally class cars are built, group N etc. No privateer ever has to crash test a car. It's heavy but if your welding is good you'll pass.
2. Go the manufacturer route. You design a cage, prove and certify via simulation that your cage meets the minimum requirements. This is how some GT3 cars have really thin wall tubing which wouldn't be allowed under appendix J 259, but you prove and certify you've done your homework and are allowed to run it. MSA in the UK accepts simulations with LS Dyna for example.",Porsche

With even a mild tune, it will chase down all but the late model GT3s on the track. Great bang for the buck. It doesn‚Äôt sound bad either just different. So why did I go with the 6?

"FIA certification of a cage requires a crash test FYI.

Anyway Gunther aren't claiming to fit a FIA certified full or half cage, just a cage and roll over protection. There is a big world of difference between FIA certified and not. Then between full cages with door bars and the more practical half cages that Porsche offer as factory fit for certain GT products outside of the the US. 

Remember not all of the outside US factory cage options are FIA compliant anyway. The TI cage if you spec the weissach pack on 4RS or 3RS isn't and neither is the CF cage. Only the steel cage in the clubsport pack is compliant and the compliance requires the optional bolt in door bars to be fitted. 

Looking at the photo's it possible the roll over protection has worked okay, if it was only engineered to provide driver protection. Part hidden half cages like Gunther where developing are hard to do unless you absolutely understand the underlying body strength.",Porsche

Edit: I am not trying to start a fight so I will say valuable instead of desirable. 

The targa was the red headed stepchild of the 911, a ‚Äúsafety convertible‚Äù as they billed it. The only reason it existed is because they hadn‚Äôt yet figured out strengthening the chassis up for a cabriolet. That changed in 1983 with the SC Cabriolet. 

I‚Äôve been watching the PCA valuation charts since the 90s. Targas have *always* been at the bottom valuation.

"There‚Äôs a few things that have actual ROI: PCCB, LWBS, FAL, Burmester Sound. (Though you may have to be a little more patient to find that particular buyer)
 
Buyers looking for these will pay extra because it‚Äôs either extraordinarily expensive or otherwise impractical to retrofit. You‚Äôd end up spending over $6k to best the Burmester option, LWBS aren‚Äôt the most practical for a daily driver (though I find them quite comfortable and my wife actually preferred them to 18-ways surprisingly) but would otherwise cost around $20k to retrofit, I‚Äôm not sure you can retrofit factory FAL, and I believe 992 PCCBs cost around $30k to retrofit OEM ‚Äîthough you can go aftermarket for about $15k, not including any caliper repaint/swap if someone wanted the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù color.

But if those aren‚Äôt something you‚Äôd use, that‚Äôs not to say you should add those simply for the next owner. The general rule: buy as much Porsche you can afford, and in the short term is pretty much impossible to lose money on a GTS, given used models were selling over MSRP last time I looked. Also given how nervous people are about the 992.2 GTS (hybrid, controversial semi-facelift), you could be in a great position.

The extended fuel tank is sort-of a ‚Äúmight as well‚Äù item given the cost, but not that necessary depending on your driving.

If cost is a concern, definitely cut the tech driver assistance stuff - ask yourself if you didn‚Äôt have those, would you even notice?

For me, it was worth it.  The GT4 is faster, sharper turning, and definitely feels more sporty (even though the CGTS was no slouch).  THe GTS, however, had heated and cooled seats, softer suspension, sat a bit higher where I never scrapped (occasionally scrape the front of my GT4), and had a tone-tone Agate/Amber interior where you only get black for the GT4.

You‚Äôll take it up the pooper from all the Porsche dealers until you buy enough vehicles OR you find a brand new dealership (recently opened) and buy a bunch of vehicles quickly to get to the top of the list.

For example: You live in Arizona and the Porsche dealer in California gives you an allocation for a Turbos S.

" It is very easy to explain. With UN R 155 the OEM is responsible for the cybersecurity of his vehicle for the lifetime of the vehicle. But actually the cybersecurity is depending on many many components coming from suppliers. For the early cars the OEM did not negotiate contracts with suppliers regulating how cybersecurity activities will be distributed between OEM and supplier. Therefore, the OEM has no legal basis to trickle these responsibilities and risks to the supplier/manufacturer of the components. Of course the suppliers are not willing to sign new contracts for these old components that will force them to be responsible for the cybersecurity for 10 years or more. So the reason why these ‚Äûold‚Äú platforms will and must die is OEM risk management.",Porsche

"FWIW, best practice nowadays seems to be to use a strong pass phrase (instead of some completely random and difficult to remember password) to secure your password manager, which in turns holds all the complex randomly generated and unique passwords for all your services.

Four or five random words strung together (for example things you see on your commute) generally gives you a super long password that is impossible to brute force yet easy for you to remember. No need for all the alphanumeric, special characters, upper-and-lowercase nonsense when your password is 20-30 letters long!",Porsche

Gt4 will also likely hold value better so it's not really a 50k delta for cost of ownership",Porsche

"The entire reason Singer/Gunther is able to sell cars to the public is because the cars are still technically 1970s 911s, they are all ""used"" with old VINs that they inhereted from an old body shell they use to base the car on.  Neither of them are required to crash test them, and the purchasers dont care. Its probably marginally safer than any other early air cooled 911 which no doubt the owners are already familiar of the risks with.

  
Same way Henessey got away with the viper venom even though it had no airbags. Its technically a lotus elise. 

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, these are vintage road cars that have been modified. I dont think theres a way where you could make it as safe as a modern car on the track without a full cage with door bars that would make it basically impossible for their usually older customer bast to get in and out of.",Porsche

If you still have to wait a while for a current 992.1 then for me that tips the favor towards waiting as they have only gotten better and better. Small chance if they do go hybrid the extra weight etc screws up the formula, but I highly doubt that. Porsche has the magic formula to print money, they aren't going to screw that up.",Porsche

For the final layer you may want to use a thinning agent. Don't if you're not sure which one to use.

Polish the end result, wet sand it before clearing and polishing if you know how to do that.

My notice is that is doesn't have a sport design rear bumper which means no front sport design bumper. A sport classic has this type of spoiler also which this car is not.

Having those bumpers is one thing, but adding a sport design spoiler has a new front lip included also. Porsche states not to use the sport design spoiler without the bumpers. I'd have to check the Sport classic lip part number to see if it is the same.

More importantly there was a large contingent of folks posting favorably regarding the flag. I was also in Rennlist recently in the General oof topic forum where there was a strong contingent of Mango Mussolini supporters. It takes all kinds to make these forums function and I try not get involved, but if there's an attempt to foul a discussion in a technical forum with some political drivel I'll speak up.

Buying a 928 from what sounds like the equivalent of a buy here pay here, no pre purchase inspection, apparently no research about the car or it's issues, and assuming that 1) anyone in their right mind would offer a warranty on a 40 year old car and 2) that a 3-month warranty would somehow save you from the thousands of dollars of maintenance you're almost certainly going to have to perform on one of the most famously unreliable and expensive to maintain cars Porsche ever produced.

Adding as top level comment: On 992 the ICs are mounted higher so I'm not sure if its as much of an issue but on 991.2 3.0T cars this is absolutely a problem because the spoiler is designed to direct air down the sides of the car and into the lateral vents which feed the IC and then turbos.

I believe Porsche said it was due to the torque curve a turbo car generates. Peak torque in the 80‚Äôs turbo was at 2500 revs and then continued throughout the rest of the rev range. The argument Porsche used was once you were up in the peak torque range  via first you didn‚Äôt need to gear shift that often so long as the gearing kept you between 2500 and 6600. So why would you need more gears? I also believe it was probably true that it was the only gearbox that could handle the torque at the time. I have an 80‚Äôs turbo and it‚Äôs like 3 forward gears and an overdrive. I believe the challenge was always to see if you could hit 100 in second!,Porsche

There‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with the 4. It‚Äôs a good motor. But the 6 is great. World class really. This is reflected in the price.

"Had my fair share of 987, 997 and 981,s and actually went from a 981 straight into a GT4. Drives and feels completely different. I was shocked at how much it felt like a completely different car rather than just faster/sharper variant. Done everything with it for over 3.5yrs now. Don‚Äôt forget the front end is entirely GT3 underpinnings and at the rear is bespoke GT4. The GTS is ‚Äújust‚Äù a top of the range comfort spec 981 and actually the pick of the bunch for a true one car does all comfortable daily 981. The GT4 is something else altogether different and in its own class which to me at least, totally justifies the cost difference. When folks talk about GT Porsche, they are only referring to the motorsport derived variants and I can genuinely see now why. If you can afford it, the only regret will be how harsh it can drive with its violent almost intangible power delivery at a certain rev range and the G forces trying to rip the smile off your face.",Porsche

"Hopefully the diverter valve is functioning properly and the turbo gets to stay spoiled during shifts as intended.
I‚Äôm sure the 930 having 4 speeds was purely about strength vs gearbox length. They already had to move the turbo motor back a tad. The 5 speed 915 gearbox has very short gear contact surfaces which becomes an issue with high torque levels. 

That said I owned a 944 turbo with a 5 speed, and then a 968 with 3.0l turbo setup and a 6 speed- both cars made great torque once spooled.
I found I missed the 5 speed, they cars were so fast you didn‚Äôt really need the extra gearshift complicating things between 0-100. Shifting between 3rd and 4th felt like just another 3rd, maybe 3.5. Not enough rpm drop. Also, every shift was a chance to overwhelm the rear tires and spin or upset the chassis in a turn.

If I regeared the top half of the box I‚Äôm sure it would be better since the ratios were picked for the N/A motor, but as they came the 5 speed could put the torque down longer! If the extra gear helped between 120-180 instead of freeway on-ramps you could use the torque more.",Porsche

I don‚Äôt see why high speed corners would be different. The suspension is just softer and the car is heavier. Mid engine vs rear engine. The gt3 front end makes a big difference. I can definitely attest that the 992 GT3 is on rails though. It handles in a different league compared to a GT4. I was taking mid speed corners probably 15-25kpmh faster in that car.,Porsche

How they skirt emissions and crash testing is by building these cars on an existing air cooled chassis VIN with all of the 1970s crash structure design. 

A carbon tub would absolutely improve safety, but they can‚Äôt use one because they need the chassis of the air cooled with the VIN tags intact to be able to sell the car.

Carbon body panels do nothing for safety on their own. 

RUF used bespoke chassis on some models, which is why the only way you can get those models is via Show and Display exemptions. 

The RUFs that you can get, would behave the same way because they also don‚Äôt have roll bars and the roofs aren‚Äôt strong enough.",Porsche

It‚Äôs also a 993 (mid 90‚Äôs model) so that comes with mid 90‚Äôs safety features as stock too- there‚Äôs been a lot of development for safety in 30 years and this seems like a loophole to keep it listed as a 993 whilst massively tuning it without the supporting safety mods.

"The 4 cylinder turbo engines really are great!  Both the 2.0L and 2.5L have lots of power, are easy to get a little more power from (if you want... not that difficult if you want a lot more power, but understand the trade-offs), have the advantage of having less engine weight, and are currently a little depressed in terms of pricing due to them being viewed by many as somehow less.

The NA 6 Cylinder is also a great engine, is all ""classic"" Porsche, and definitely hits all the right notes with many people looking for a Porsche.  From a practical stand point, the engine is more responsive.

For the near term, values on the 6 Cylinder cars will be higher, and possibly this will be the case in the long term (it is really just a guess as far as how the turbo fours will be viewed after the 983 arrives).  They are not really THAT different, but they are different.

The Panamera is a good car too, and one that can offer a lot of power.  Four door Porsches depreciate at rates much closer to the rest of the automobile world.  This is good if you are looking used, but means you will see a big drop in value if you are buying new, or within a couple years of production.  While they have a good amount of power, they are also very heavy, luxury cars.  If you are looking for a sports car, they are not.  They have a sporty nature, and their Porsche DNA is evident when you drive them.  But despite the power, if you drive one on the track, they just are not in the same class as the 718 models.",Porsche

The nails can't penetrate it, only scratch, and I can easily wipe clean and condition with Lexol.  Catches hair, drool, eveything.",Porsche

"I went from an E36 M3 to a 981 Cayman. For me no.  I use my phone for the ""technological progress.""

Both cars had power windows, locks, remotes, heated seats, good enough speakers. I added an aux unit into my E36 and eventually had bluetooth in there like I do with my 981. So a 30 year old car could do everything that my Cayman could do today. I do like the parking sensor on the Cayman. That helps. 

I didn't have power seats but it was an option. I never use my screen on my Cayman, it's useless.

Now if you want to get into mechanical stuff, of course the designs and engineering is way better on the Cayman especially with computers being more involved, robotics more prevalent in the car building.",Porsche

"992 Targa 4s owner here. 

Bought it mostly untestdriven. No regrets. Took it on a trip last summer from Vermont to Smokey mountains and back, and it was a blast, and very comfortable.

Wind noise is present but it‚Äôs fine (but then I come from riding BMW GS motorcycles so maybe I think of it differently). Buffeting isn‚Äôt too much of an issue with the deflector on the new ones.

18 way seats are nice, I have them, but if you have a large ass like myself, you might consider the 14 ways instead as they have more bolster give in the seat. That might be the one thing I would change on mine.  

The top does take a while to open/close compared to the cab, but I got the SMARTop adapter so I can open and close from the remote, and bonus, you get to see it in action.     You still can‚Äôt open/close while driving, but you can open/close while in drive or inching forward, and it doesn‚Äôt suddenly stop mid-cycle because you change gear or open  a door etc. which means 19 seconds, is exactly that, not 19second + and error message+ a reset+ etc

As for other options. It‚Äôs really up to you, I like the LKA and Adaptive cruise, but YMMV. 

In the 4s, PASM is really nice on the Targas, it does tighten up the car significantly when you want it.  

I find the front lift useful for my needs, but you might not depending on where you live. 

The biggest thing you need to know about the Targa, is that it attracts attention from Everyone! A GT3 or GT4 will get a nod from a car guy. The Targa will have you talking to the UberEats dude on a bicycle at a stop light, the old guy in an Aldi parking lot, or a woman walking her dog. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for that.",Porsche
I think the 14 ways but not less. Premium and sport package unless this is a track mule. If you like music passionately get Burmeister as the boss is MId.,Porsche
I‚Äôve seen a video by the guy I forgot his name the real version of the ‚Äúdrift king‚Äù driving a red eye I believe around a touge and he didn‚Äôt think it was that bad handling wise he obviously mentioned it is heavy but I think people overhype it and because someone saw someone else overhype it they say it themselves and it spreads.

Essentially, some car manufacturers are building cars that are very easy to steal by simply using the OBD port, and they know of these vulnerabilities.  The videos show how easy it is to steal these cars including Ferraris and McLaren.

As a whole, and as much many are complaining, this is a good thing. Everyone here complains about how easy it is to steal these cars (and other luxury cars).  Obviously these companies are choosing the easy way which is to keep them unsafe, and also as the video notes, why would they complain? A stolen car means more business for them . . .

So it's up to regulators to enforce secure requirements so we have a brighter future and our valuables are more secured.  I doubt the 718 is the only car that will be affected by these rules.",Porsche

It's even more depressing to see how the people that steal cars do so with so much impunity; law enforcement does not seem to care about this issue because ""insurance"" pays.

Bose is better than base for the $$, Burmester is pricey

Here is a build that I stand by... not a ton of ""fluff"" and will be a very usable car. PDCC would be something to add, or RS wheels if you do not like centerlocks.

They do reduce lift, which is akin to downforce, but it still isn't the same.  It achieves this at the cost of increased drag (which, aside from a diffuser, is pretty much all aero devices).  They don't produce downforce as they operate in the laminar layer and don't really get into the turbulent airflow.",Porsche

All other things being equal with a 4spd your RPMs drop more every time you shift.

*Either the affected vehicle is brought up to the latest cyber security standard, or the model must be withdrawn from the programme.

i would say go for the 992.2 if you can wait.  the hybrid assist, if present, will only benefit the turbo by eliminating lag in the low rpms.  i dont think people will care about a little bit of weight gain and electrifcation.   now when the gt3 gets hybrid... there will be blood in the streets lol",Porsche

"I've owned a 991 (C2S), 997 (C2S), and 981 (GT4). All MT coupes. The 981 Spyder is a bit of a 981 Boxster GTS and 981 GT4 hybrid.

Of those, the 981 is easily the most exciting to drive. Not even close. Much sharper, more immediate, much more raucous and theatrical. My wife hated it. :) Again, though, that's a GT4 and to a lesser extent the Spyder. If you're looking at a base 981 or even a 981S, the equation changes a bit.

The 991 and 997 are both closer to grand touring cars, more of a daily driver vibe. Everything is more relaxed and muted; less exciting, but more comfortable. Some people will try to tell you the 997 (C2S) is a raw sports car, but ehh...it's less refined and you get more steering feedback, but the fundamental character isn't terribly different than the 991.",Porsche

The dealer handled all the repairs, and all correspondence with the insurance company.

At Ferrari it does matter that you‚Äôve purchased other cars. Not necessarily by dealer. I was just asking the question.  I knew the likely answer was there‚Äôs no resolution in case someone knew something I didn‚Äôt. Disheartening because there was a handshake agreement but is what it is.,Porsche

"Does the flap still activate? That would be weird. Funny, but weird.",Porsche
"I was at Rennsport and saw (and heard) the GT4 E Performance ripping around the track. Looked pretty good to me, and very fast. Weighs about 3500# too.
Bet you think the Taycan is a flop too, eh? Should probably review the sales sheets again. 
A near zero maintenance two door Porsche EV is going to be a hit as long as they price it inline with their current lineup. I'm looking forward to it.",Porsche
"Love it. Are those standard exhaust tips, or Ninemeister upgrades?",Porsche
"Thanks for asking!

"Haha, believe it or not, I actually got permission! I haven't been back in a good minute though... Bummed they blocked it off.",Porsche
"it's super responsive and fun. I'm coming from a model s plaid and I have a m5 comp. It's very similar to the m5, in a suv + the handling is insane",Porsche
"I think it fits with all the black accents. However, I think it busies up the car. But what do I know, I‚Äôm in the wrx tax bracket not the 911 tax bracket and my car is all the busy.",Porsche
"Haha yea, I knew the wheel would need to be replaced I just didn‚Äôt have much knowledge about the rest",Porsche
"there are (were) continental GT3 cars and also vantage GT3 cars, but point is a road going Vantage/Continental and a road going 911 GT3 will be perceived very differently by an average person. But their race versions race in the same race/class.",Porsche
"Hot take: it‚Äôs the best looking car they make right now.

I absolutely love it",Porsche
Cheaper is relative. 50-70k for that one depending on miles and whether it's manual or not.,Porsche
Is this for protection or looks?,Porsche
Bragging rights. What is any 4 door car with a sports car pedigree worth?,Porsche
That would be nice..,Porsche
Not sure you‚Äôre getting downvoted for being right.,Porsche
