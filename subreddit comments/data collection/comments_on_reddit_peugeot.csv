Just don't let it run out of charge and go dead on the roadside. I'm a tow truck driver and had to pick one up at 0%. Only way I could get it to shift out of park and Into nuetral was to disconnect the 12vbattery for 5 mins and reconnect,peugeot

"I guess you were unlucky, whoever had your car before probably rode the clutch.

As for the noise, if you have the windows open you should be able to hear the turbo sucking in air, which is probably what you're hearing. But if you're feeling a loss of power under acceleration, it could be one of the pipes around the turbo leaking.",peugeot
"On cars with belts from 2017-2023, yes, it usually gets stretched and gets shredded on the side but can crack in other places when the top layer melts. Previous belts (<2017) had issues with cracks all over the place.

"When it happened in my 2008 (2018) 1.2 Puretech, also sounded normal and drove normal. Disappeared after turning it off and on. 

Then I noticed that it does that when load increases, like sudden acceleration or going up a hill. Took it to the garage, it was the common wet timing belt issue. 

For you, it might as well be the fuel, you could try and drive it with higher revs for a bit 🤷🏻‍♂️

"Nope, it's something else and cuise control was disabled as consequence. If it was only a cruise control it would just say cruise control fault (and it would probably be just a clutch/brake switch like in 95% of cruise control problems).

Check all the liquids levels and colors/consistencies first (brake, engine oil, coolant, transmission). But without proper diagnostics it would be hard to tell - you did not even post your engine - if you did we would know better",peugeot

"Make sure the fuel filter is seated correctly, on some models not only does it have to be the right way up, it has to be in the correct radial orientation. And make sure the filter housing lid is seated correctly. As far as I know these engines will self prime if you turn the key a few times without firing the engine. You could maybe add some fuel to the filter housing to help? The low fuel pressure could also be down to the low pressure fuel pump that lives in the fuel tank. when you turn the keys you should be able to hear the ‘whirr’ sound the pump makes as it’s priming. You could pop the fuel line off that goes in to the fuel filter housing and put it in a clear bottle, if after a few tries of priming the system there isn’t any diesel in the bottle the pump may be goosed.",peugeot

"I drove the 208 EAT8. It's a fun car to drive, probably one of the more fun 3-Cylinders I've driven.

I’m making no excuses that the 1.2 Puretech is an exceptionally reliable engine. It’s not, especially the wet belt version of the engine (non-Hybrid), it does have some issues that still persist (oil dilution resulting in excessive belt wear, clogged oil intake, oil burning at high mileage).

**But** these can be mitigated with proper maintenance and vigilance.

* You can check the Puretech belt through the oil filler (simply remove cap), **I recommend doing this every service** as I've seen a ""dealer-serviced"" approved used 2020 208 with a badly cracked belt at only 58,000km. So some dealers are obviously pretty sloppy at checking up on the belt. **If there is cracking or delamination (separating of the backing material of the belt), the belt needs to be changed asap**
* The **oil intake in the sump needs cleaning after every belt change**, make a point to have this done, as the far bigger problem with the puretech is low oil pressure and oil starvation due to the oil intake being clogged with belt debris. Catastrophic belt failure is less common.
* **NEVER skip an oil change** with the Puretech, the 20,000km interval is already too long, and a sure way to kill the belt is missing an oil change by thousands of km. Because petrol in the oil can eat away at the belt.

What has been improved since the original puretech from 12 years ago:

* Lower belt change interval at 6Y/100,000km
* Improved Belt (allegedly)
* Improved oil intake less prone to clogging

How to check belt through oil filler:

"Anyone else can correct me but my first thought is a worn water pump. Check it to see if it has any play. I'd replace it and replace the belt whilst you are at it.

"So I’m going to say jein.

1. The EAT8 is a fine transmission and the 8-Speed auto will do the heavy lifting for you, and help keep the engine at the optimal rpm for what you need. 

2. The engine is powerful enough **but** it only makes real power around >3000-3500rpm, so if you want such a big car to move you will hear the engine quite a bit. This is why many people say the puretech 130 doesn’t have enough power, you have to thrash it a bit to get power out of it. 

It’s not an unpleasant noise as such, I quite like a 3-Cylinder but it’s definitely not the refined engine you expect from a typical “big Citroen”.

However, overall given the price difference. I would have the 1.2 (mediocre-ish longevity aside). But that’s also because I’m not an autobahn speedster, drove a 1.6 tdi most of my life. and once the EAT8 gets into 8th gear it’s quiet, only overtaking may be a struggle.

See for yourself how it drives, and accelerates. I say it’s not bad but the engine is obviously noisy under acceleration. 0-100 in 10.3 seconds, an OK (but not great) figure for a family car imo.

One thing to note is that your milage is stored in the cluster, so when connecting a used cluster, if by any chance it has more miles than the current one, it will overwrite both the cluster and the BSI milage. That's the gamble with used ones, as I got mine from a car that I could check the mileage of the cluster. A friend of mine did the swap as well on his 308, but the cluster he bought had 230k miles (his car had 110k original miles).

I'd recommend halving the engine oil change interval, as this can prevent costly issues down the line, and is cheaper than doing repairs to the engine.

It's probably also a good idea to do a transmission service as well, if there's no documented service in the last 5 years.

Also make sure there's no water in the spare wheel well, and that the parking brake is working properly, as lack of use can jam the parking brake. Make sure it engages properly, and disengages smoothly when setting off.",peugeot

Today I tried the rear washer again - and it still worked

Then (unlike yesterday) - I tried the front wipers on their won - WITHOUT trying the front washers

When I tried the front washers after that...THEY WORKED!

Took it back to the garage for a MOT re-test - and the MOT guy said when things stop working / then re-start working - it's sometimes a component's way of telling you it's on its way to dying

I added that I RARELY use my washers...because I am afraid of using up the fluid - and asked him if my UNDER-USING them could have possibly clogged the pipes...?

He said it's very possible - as every component on a car should be used every so often - or they can cease working through NON-use...

Pugs = mainly services some older 2008 need a new turbo being most popular job and sensor issues all older models 2018

Fiat = gearbox is made of paper big job expensive big issues but drive is fun and feels great

I would find a Peugeot specialist near you and take it to them to change the belt and the oil pickup in the sump. If it has just shown the oil pressure light you might get away with it. It also only cost me £600 for all that work which if a lot less than a new engine :)

The car has done 207,000+ miles and I suspect that filter was never changed. I've had the car since new and until recently it was serviced by Peugeot dealerships. 
The difference is wonderful. The air comes blasting out and is beautifully clean and fresh now.  The filter is located in the right hand side of the front left footwell. Warning! It's a darn sight harder to put the new one than get the old one out. It's awkward to do and I got a bit nauseous struggling to do it. I realised why no one bothered to change it before.",peugeot
"Well, I bought the LED version for my 208 here in Brazil, I don't see why you wouldn't be able to do the same for your 508 in Portugal. I imported through a Lithuanian distributor, it came inside a PSA box from Poland. If you're worried about compatibility, it should be plug and play.",peugeot
"After filling the tank to the top it ran lovely for a day then went back to spluttering powerless  and throwing up codes.

"I am also afraid of the diesel because we often have to cover short trips (5-15km) and I think a PHEV would be fine for that. I also read a lot of bad things about the diesel (AdBlue related problems). Still, what you write sounds bad - maybe I should just avoid 3008/5008/C5A and go with a Prius+.",peugeot

As for the 307 itself: there are quite a few electrical bugs and faults, some issues with belt tensioners, and automatic 'boxes. The models after 2005 fix many of these issues are fixed though. 

Overall though, it's not a car I would want to put a lot of effort in- they're just not interesting/fun enough to excuse the issues a 20 y/o car will have.",peugeot

"Not the best manual transmission for sure, but usable. Aaand the 180 HP engine only came with the manual ;) That's very fun to drive even with the roof on. Loves to rev though, so if that's not your thing you may be better served with the automatic, just be prepared for higher costs both at the gas station and otherwise.

"And what am I talking about? Adequate performance is subjective I guess. All I'm saying is that competitors of the 408 offer the same type of performance for similar amount of money, and in many cases worse performance. 

I mention the engine capabilities because every single person who says it's too weak looks at its size and the fact that it's 3 cilinders while overlooking actual performance of the car itself, as a whole. You can get better performance, of course, even in the 408, if you are willing to spend more.

Anyway, 1-100kph in 10-11 seconds is about average for entry models on these types of cars, and for some people it's enough, and your ""objective"" advice is anything but.

The same engine is also found on the 208, but that's irrelevant, as along with the C3 it's a B segment car and they both cost less as opposed to the 408 which is C segment.",peugeot
"Done this a couple of times since I got mine.

I'm from an IT background so I always take the cautious approach with this kind of thing (had the occasional server or PC firmware updates go wrong!!) The Peugeot PC app will format the USB so it forces you to only have one update on the stick at a time. My updates have always been at different times though, so I'm not going to take a guess as to what happens if you do manage to put both on the stick! 

Due to my cautiousness, I've always sat in the car while it's being updated and not driven it, partly because most of my trips are local so would be much shorter than the update time. It's a good opportunity to grab a book and some time away from the kids, lol! Otherwise personally, I wouldn't like to leave the car unattended especially somewhere other than home mid-update, even if it is locked since the ignition will be on. 

From experience, the firmware takes around 45 mins to run, maps, if you only select one country (I'm guessing UK for you as it is for me) takes about 25-30 mins",peugeot

"Not a mechanic so don't take my word for it, I just try to know the parts to avoid being deceived at mechanics stores... I THINK it is the access/devortice box (don't know how to call in English, it ensures right amount of air in the right speed and flow)  right in the middle, in the upper left I think is the regulator for the spark plugs Or the injection system, and in the left seems the computer core for some electrical system...

Hello,peugeot
"You can change the gauge screen on the right (windscreen wiper) stock, its the button in the tip. Or it might be the left stock, not sure :D. I have new 308,  which has the same infotainment.

So if you have incar tomtom navigation it shows a full map in there but with androidauto its only those arrows (and distance to it) on the screen.

Edit. Theres like 5 different views which you can choose from. You can also access them in the settings from the main screen. I always use the one with the map so thats why I dont remember which stock it is that has the button to change it.",peugeot

Cool. I've been using mine mostly for short trips so I don't have a sense of what the actual range is. I know it's not what it says on the box. But I'm planning a longer trip and it's helpful to know if I should aim at chargers 200 or 300km apart.,peugeot

"Those lines 🤤 always wanted to take a punt on a 206, absolutely beautifully designed car.",peugeot
"Fuck that’s what I thought. Any idea how to reset that service light interval on this? I tried a tutorial for the mk3 as well but that didn’t work either. 

I’m thinking I’d probably need an OBD scanner if anything.

That’s a lot of effort to go through to put that in.",peugeot
For me screen frooze on a hands free call and wouldn't close even when I turned the ignition off. So just unplugged the battery for a sec and system rebooted. Hope it helps!,peugeot
"Unfortunately it depends on the residues after oil changes because they designed the drain hole like a reverse asshole, the belt goes through the shit while spinning and harder particles and cheaper oil additives makes it last less than an half its expected lifetime. Ironically wet belt is a technology primarily adopted because it lasts for longer than a dry one, VW and Ford uses it to drive the pumps on their diesel engines.",peugeot

I can honestly say I think I prefer the Peugeot. The only thing I wish mine had is the auto hold function when not on an incline. Other than that, the amount of tech in the car is awesome.

"European cars have features which are useless to people in Australia. Like heated car seats unless I need a function for daily operation of a vehicle like indicators  wipers and  lights then it's a superfluous feature.
My car also came with the stereo removed and a touch screen one instead. That means a lot of the features accessible through stereo controls are not available. Like the ability to set time on the dash clock. The car didn't come with a manual and because the sunroof had a crack in it the previous owner hid  that fact. The sunroof isn't obvious as it is literally a whole roof panel that has retractable awning that looks like a normal car roof trimming. On top is a roof rack with a cargo carrier that covers up the roof.
I don't need a sunroof to check my blind spots as I have windows (and blind spot mirrors). I had to remove the tinting from the windows as it had creased to the point where it was distorting the view through the windows.",peugeot

Yeah I’m not sure either to be honest, if it’s third gear only it’s got to be a gearbox mechanical issue, and it working fine by operating the selector manually suggests the 3rd gear selector shaft isn’t bent.

"I traded my 2022 petrol one for a 408.  I’m slightly taller than average and the middle console pressed against the slide of my calf that I would get bruising if I drove over 30 minutes.  Nice car, really.  Just not compatible for my frame.",peugeot
"Keep the service interval religiously and use correct oil because of the belt. Also make sure that the belt is changed every 85k km or whatever their interval is these days.


Once it shows the first sign of engine problem excessive oil consumption etc just sell and buy something else. Keep in mind that the community consensus for the life of the wet belt engine is about 200k km before it needs major repairs.

Otherwise lovely engine...",peugeot
"""toy"" = run of the mill family car",peugeot
"how is it? I heard mix reviews about this car ,I'm considering a 2016 2.0 hdi 150hp to buy soon",peugeot
"With any high powered turbo car it will not live as long as a diesel, however I got mine at 94k and currently at 115k and driving perfectly, no issues or drop in performance, only thing is if anything starts to act up, get it fixed immediately, as it's a built engine with forged internals it's strong but also very expensive if anything goes wrong. Alot of simple things will help, make sure you let the car warm up properly before driving hard and also another thing to know is the alcon brakes on the car are amazing but very expensive to replace the disk's and calipers if needed, so ensure its got a full service history, and ideally replaced alcon disk's.",peugeot
Manual all the way. I have a 307cc manual transmission and it works very well and never had any problems,peugeot
"Yes that's true, but power was only 1 of the reasons haha. I like the style very much, I also like the dashboard, and it has 130hp, among other things. But honestly I'm still considering things, my 208 is getting the job done at the moment. Just weighing my options.",peugeot
You gotta put the vaseline in it first. Duh,peugeot
There is an empty space where they should be. I don't see seatbelts for the 3rd row either,peugeot
It’s a Peugeot 508 2015-2019,peugeot
i have a costumer that provides auto spare parts and checked for you what is the manufacturer . its gates like you said,peugeot
"Congrats! :)
How much did you pay for It and how many KMs on the clock, if I may ask?",peugeot
"Exactly, what I'd do is start my Citroen, put on my seatbelt, find something to play on my stereo and off I go. About a 30 second process.",peugeot
"I drive a 2.0 HDI 407, it sounds fine to me. It sounds just like the engine in my car (88000 km, perfect condition). I think what you're hearing are the injectors, since you are recording so close to them.",peugeot
Possibly a wheel bearing a drive shaft or CV joint. These older pugs had gearbox issues too. Jack it up and give the wheel a spin and a shake.,peugeot
Do i losen the bleeding bolt under filter ?,peugeot
Peugot,peugeot
😉😉😉,peugeot
Just do some long distance,peugeot
Nice rims! 👀,peugeot
Sweet sweet car! Love a cab.,peugeot
"While correct, this is kinda terrible advice. It should only be reset when it has actually been serviced, just resetting it is sticking your head in the sand and a recipe for trouble.",peugeot
double check the filter is installed correctly and all fuel lines are clicked into place.,peugeot
"Yea, the air box and cabin filter are in the exact same spot as the 1.6 hdi sport 207.....i was hoping for an easier airbox, now I had a petrol engine......but I guess Peugeot just like to make things different.",peugeot
"No, inline fuel filter is under the car, a metal canister",peugeot
I was told than all are going to the chain to replace the belt engine on a training course.,peugeot
Yes it’s fine it’s just good you’re doing frequent oil changes!,peugeot
Yes USA pressure a lot Peugeot they quit Iran because of them. Hope you will get 3008 too,peugeot
Enjoy!,peugeot
Part number for inline fuel filter is 1567C6,peugeot
"Buy with manual transmission, they are more reliable and more fun to drive.",peugeot
"Yes, it's literally the most common problem on these 1.2 Puretech engines, turns out putting a belt inside the engine is no good. Hope you can fix it and not have to buy a whole new engine which eventually will have the same problem",peugeot
"As others already mentioned, never felt like struggling. 
I believe that anyway the perception is a bit subjective, depending on your driving style and the expectations you have from the car.",peugeot
"Make sure you are full on oil. Not in the middle of the dipstick, but to the highest point",peugeot
I’m going for the 400K 😄,peugeot
As long as you don’t go faster than 110km/u because that will drain your range really fast :/,peugeot
"OP, What’s wrong with you???! Only one picture? :)))",peugeot
You can do that???,peugeot
i thought the halogen headlights were exclusive to the LATAM version of the 208 😯,peugeot
"yes it has to have the option - but depending on the region it is being sold, it either works if you are in first gear while clutch is pressed, or it works for few seconds after you release the brake (no matter the gear) until you release the clutch or start drivind",peugeot
🤔 Have you tried just pressing the Phone Piano key for 15 seconds? Maybe check fuses?,peugeot
Damn,peugeot
"Thank you for your accurate reply, so you say it's normal? I also had it checked by another mechanic who also said, being new the timing belt, it shouldn't have those fibers hence why I had to double check with you guys.

Peugeot accepted to replace though, but if it's pointless, do you suggest to avoid replacing again?",peugeot
"Take it to a tyre depot, they can sort this and get rid of the locking bolt on all wheels. I have the same car, 2017. UK spec and there is no locking wheel nut on this car.",peugeot
Cool,peugeot
"Have you looked at AutoDoc? If you're in Europe, they're usually the cheapest for parts, and they stock both H&R and Eibach lowering springs.",peugeot
And its OEM original,peugeot
Nice. We need more of these and less Rangers and Hiluxes,peugeot
Looks Chinese,peugeot
Hello?,peugeot
"Thanks, though I have a Samsung",peugeot
Any update,peugeot
"Yea after checking again, I think it’s the plastic and not a hose. Time to buy a new radiator I guess..",peugeot
"You don't think that sounds like a reason to replace the unit? Could be cables, could be the speakers. Most likely the amp. Replace it",peugeot
Nice! Learned to drive in one! They are a good size but i found it awkward to park.,peugeot
That was my question when I was looking for a new car and found out we will have a 3rd child. No other car on the market comes close to the 5008 in terms of quality/space/vallue when your main focus is securely seating 3 kids in individual isofix seats. Hence my new 5008 :),peugeot
"From the Netherlands, cheapest 1.6 petrol I can currently find is 12000 euros. I can find diesels for cheap but for several reasons I need to stay away from diesels",peugeot
Yep it won’t say engine failure! So you need the faults reading,peugeot
Walter,peugeot
"I feel broke, My first car is a 207 2009....",peugeot
Diesels are all right. Avoid petrol engines.,peugeot
From my experience around 200km,peugeot
"Depends on your local laws/legislation.

 Here in Finland it depends on the years model the car is on what is required and there's a dB test",peugeot
"Oh, and if you are in the UK look for Pug1off They are UK-based Peugeot performance parts, seller and also a workshop that is pretty good.

And if you are outside anywhere, it doesn’t really matter, they sent you parts wherever you are",peugeot
"Just joined, thanks!",peugeot
It needs a service,peugeot
"i saw those, but its only some of them with that specific interior its really weird man, but i'll keep an eye out :)",peugeot
"It’s long so here goes 
low pressure in fuel rail code
Camshaft position sensor b code 
Misfiring very lumpy idle loss of power sometimes no revs at all unless you hold down pedal and wait fan comes on in take off mode,  virtually no fuel in return line to tank.sometimes car runs like a dream. 
So far it’s had new Peugeot parts fitted at huge cost plugs coils hpfp cam sensor new chain + tensioner,  none of that prevented same fault codes appearing p0087 p1340, cleaned filter bag in fuel pump and filled the tank to the top ran like a dream for two days, now low pressure fault eml on again. I’m so frustrated with this car",peugeot
"Damn, really jealous of bith that car, that scenery, and that weather! Where i live, snow has gotten pretty rare nowadays...",peugeot
"I have same model 2014 , the problemwith this is adblue , that can block and won't work because is not made good , cap of adblue is not made with hole and is creating vacuum on this wey pump for adblue die and for other I think is ok , better check if km is real and how is under . Engine 1.6 hdi pass 300km+ if you care properly.",peugeot
Perfect for dogging 🤣,peugeot
That explains why Peugeot drivers don’t have full control of their vehicle,peugeot
Ah OK then nevermind my post please.,peugeot
"The things is that I do not feel ay change in the driving, maybe I should pay more attention to it",peugeot
About 40min,peugeot
"Nope, also sports mode resets after pushing stop/start.",peugeot
"If the belt is looked after, services every 12500 miles/12 months, belt inspected for wear and periodic checks on the oil pick up, and if you have money for rather frequent belt changes 60000 miles/4 years. it can be a somewhat reliable engine, it's not an engine which can be neglected, and if there are belt failures Peugeot have seemed to be good on covering some repairs.",peugeot
"Thats a good looking 206, can you please tell me your wheel specs ? Im thinking of buying R16 but im bit afraid if they will fit.",peugeot
Fellow Bordelais!!,peugeot
Not that expensive! A good surprise :),peugeot
"No diesel, no petrol?

Poor peugeot…",peugeot
and how about a 2011 508SW? My grandparents own a 2001 406 coupe and my mother owns an electric 308. Both have been pretty impressive to me. When is too new/too old?,peugeot
That’s an expansion tank the leaves is fine at max the room above is needed for pressure,peugeot
"I haven't seen the new detailed quote, he only told me the amount on the phone as they called just before closing. I was still working at the time of call so wasn't in a situation to have an extended chat. I do have the quote for the engine work alone from last week in my emails, and they added around £220 before VAT on the bill for ABS work I didn't ask for.

The belt didn't snap, apparently the valves were unscathed. That's a whole other headache I'm trying to sort with the seller on the side.",peugeot
"Thank you so much for your reply. So, in fact I am going to save a bit of money if I buy this key cause I heard that the dealer may charge 200 euros or so. I hope the programming won't be as expensive.",peugeot
"I'm talking about horsepower and torque, not the actual construction of the engine, for adequate performance the 408 needs a bog standard 180PS 1.6Puretech, which was offered in the 3008 and 5008. 

The 408 is also over £30k and it comes with an engine that's in a C3 which costs barely £20k, I wouldn't be ""complaining"" if the PHEV versions weren't excessively expensive at over £40k which means they get stuck with the luxury vehicle tax.",peugeot
"Firstly if you think your airbag has an issue, you don't really want to be checking anything yourself without taking appropriate precautions; you don't want to have that accidentally going off. Worth checking your fuses first though; the horn on some models has a dedicated fuse so that's your first port of call.",peugeot
"Defs engine mount, we had same issue exact same car",peugeot
"THIS is EXACTLY the kind of answer I was looking for, THANK YOU! I definitely do not want to alter the lights in any way, I was hoping that there is only one light for all models and it just appears different in different lighting. I saw several videos and also saw the GT model a few times irl and I agree with you, the tail lights blend in in absolute perfection, no need to change them.",peugeot
"The question has already been answered about it being a big issue, so there is no need to comment further about that. I would like to add however, that your oil will be contaminated with fragments of belt rubber and other belt contaminates as the belt is slowly going through delamination. Oil filter and oil pick up strainer will be full of this as well as potention for the oil ways and return channels to become blocked. 

Strangely, whenever I've done a conventional timing belt, I remember being taught that the engine oil contaminating a new belt was bad for its service life and added potential for premature failure. What genius decided to run the belt in extremely hot engine oil to 'help the environment' by creating an engine that adds a 'few extra' MPG to be in line with the latest Euro standard for emissions? 

Same with the 1.0 Ford Eco boost engine...... Flawed design. How is all this engine replacement helping the environment now? If you pander to all that nonsense we are being spoon fed? 😬",peugeot
Can’t tell you shit about the engine but can tell you that we both rock the Primark Deadpool snoodie 🤣,peugeot
"Bet those mods really jack up the cost of insurance. Out of interest, I did an insurance quote on one of those sporty (ish) Citroen DS3’s with a matt black wrap, the other day, just to see what difference it made to the quote. First I did one declaring the wrap, and it came to £3572.94. Quite high, but I didn’t think much of it since insurance is pretty much always extortionate for me. Then I did a quote without declaring the wrap, and it came to £2185.19! £1387.75 less! The price got almost 64% more expensive just because the colour is nonstandard. I’m honestly at my wits fucking end with car insurance companies.",peugeot
"I bought a 2022 one with 8k miles for £18k. 

Does yours have the old style drive mode selector with the raised knob or the newer switch selector?

Great cars. Fast and manoeuvres like a dream.",peugeot
"Get part number, look on ebay, it'd tide you over for a bit, and keeps you mobile while one is on order.",peugeot
MAF ? plus I wouldn't leave a car running idle for 10min every time you start the car... Bad for the engine 😬,peugeot
"We had a 2020 peigeot 208 active 75 manual. It used about 5.5-6 liters / 100km 

We just swapped it for the 308 sw with puretech 1.2 130hp automatic and get about 8-8.3l/100.

I usually turn of the start stop in the 308 as its a bit clumsy. 

I liked the 208 but the 308 is an upgrade in interior quality, its more quiet and has more space.",peugeot
"Also interested. Wanna add though, that with any used car you should expect to spend at least 20% of the purchase price at the mechanic's in the first year...",peugeot
"I am glad i dont have new car. Because my kid just found nice rock, which can draw on car apparently :)
I think if i buy new car, i crash it or some other shit happens.",peugeot
Thank you very much.,peugeot
Screwdriver & brute force,peugeot
Peugeot,peugeot
Replace the stereo with an aftermarket device. A firmware update won't make a Bluetooth 2 device work like a Bluetooth 5+,peugeot
"I don’t think there’s anything logical you’re missing. For me the extra trim level is outweighed by the 2 year newer car. 

One minor thing - are they actually 2 years different or is that based on year of registration (eg in the UK the number plate gives you a 6 month period in which it was registered).


I’ve just bought a used e2008 and there were some odd variations in pricing that I couldn’t explain.",peugeot
Thank you for your help :),peugeot
"I've the exact same but with a manual transmission!

Coming from a 900cc Toyota Yaris (2010) the 308 SW feels like a space ship!

Enjoy!",peugeot
"Thank you, I had one on mine as well.",peugeot
"I call mine Cedric, he’s a 508.",peugeot
There is a reason the 1.2 puretech engine is called ''The engine of death'',peugeot
"Go to a scrapyard that's got a 208 in stock, and buy the wheels.

I believe they're 16"" 6.5J ET32 4x108 wheels, and I think 16s from a 208 I will also fit, and will be cheaper and easier to find.",peugeot
It’s probably a marker of distance travelled since you last reset the odometer. Rather than actually pinpointing a specific location. To get 6700km away from a place you’re more than likely not in the same country assuming you’re at least in Europe.,peugeot
"I was just checking off one car, noticed that button is present, but didn't see so it would lit up ambient lights. Need to check next time if lights are actually present.",peugeot
"this is interesting, I have an rca/3.5mm jack cable plugged into the phone and it works in aux mode.  Although its quality is quite low.  However, you can use the ""jukebox"" to copy music from a CD to mp3, you can also choose the quality, maybe you have 16 GB of space.  Or use a cigarette lighter Bluetooth Fm adapter.",peugeot
😂🤣,peugeot
"Nope, didn't find a thing",peugeot
"My experience (at least in my country where automatic has grown a lot in the last years but still doesn't reach 10% of the total cars on the road), a used car of any brand with an automatic transmission is a recipe for disaster.

People don't know how to use and maintain them, and there are very few shops that specialize in repairing them.",peugeot
"Yeah I’m not sure either, the 1.0 is a funny engine considering it can have a carb or single point injection, distributor, coil pack, or coil pack on plugs.  The TU had three locations for map sensors, on the inlet plenum to the left hand side, built into the ecu (KFZ and one other I think) or bolted to the inner wing as a separate module, but I can’t find a picture of that engine bay to say for definite.

I’d change the crank sensor any way, they’re so exposed at the front, I wouldn’t be suprised",peugeot
If you have low standards then true I guess.,peugeot
More! More! More! More!,peugeot
"That's the timing belt  fraying, I'd advise not driving it unless it's to a Peugeot dealer or an emergency. The parts of the belt coming apart will block the oil pump and starve the engine of oil causing potential catastrophic engine failure",peugeot
Ok Thanks bro.,peugeot
How can you ask if it’s a big issue ? Like your timing belt is dead and it’s not a big issue ?,peugeot
"Basically if you baby it like a Ferrari, the engine *may* outlast your interest in the car.",peugeot
"Thanks! I didn’t know it hid my response. I can still see it normally. Very interesting.

Also for anyone ordering, the ‘color name’ I ordered was ‘4’",peugeot
There's probably too much air in it for it to prime. Loosen the filter so the air can escape as you prime it and when it starts leaking diesel then tighten it and prime a bit more before trying to start it.,peugeot
🤝🏼,peugeot
"Oh, Denmark - that explains it 😉 in UK it would cost an arm and leg! 😩",peugeot
That’s it!,peugeot
I would like that indeed.,peugeot
Definitely not the case with the previous 208 allure. Even then the engine broke down. But (seriously) it looks great and I wish OP all the best.,peugeot
Nice! Very rare car here... I wouldn't mind one with the DW10.,peugeot
"Yeah, I'll see about that.",peugeot
Isn't it just fluff and shit stuck to the side of the belt with a bit of oil,peugeot
"That’s annoying, but the thing is it’s still a Peugeot

That’s why I mentioned, you might go into build a custom one out of parts where you can assemble your own line  of intake",peugeot
"Dang, what a first car- I also got the 2023 version and absolutely loving it",peugeot
Noce little weekend toy. Just wonder about insurance on that 🤔,peugeot
Very underrated imo. The interior is 100x better than a similarly priced fiesta ST and quicker.,peugeot
🤣🤣,peugeot
It's a 308 too,peugeot
"Definitely a ground fault, common on the 407 too. My 407 did that too with the rear right lights. Every time I signalled right or braked, it would beep at me to tell me that a bulb is broken in the right taillight, but everything worked fine.

[HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gVq7tK7s4bf_yGSZxe_zA9jBQWhcBXR5/view?usp=sharing) is the permanent fix for the 407, it's probably very similar for the 207.

edit: Found a video for the same fix on a 207: [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIYdTEv6q2Q)",peugeot
"Personally I don’t find the manual transmission in the 307 *that* bad. 

I drove a 1.4 5spd a while back, the shifter is not precise and a bit rubbery, but it’s easy enough to find gears, there is just a lot of play in the shifter even when in gear. I would say relatively typical for a family car of this era.",peugeot
I believe if you hold down the deferred charging button (the clock symbol next to the charging port) it should release the charger.,peugeot
Hi,peugeot
Congrats 🎉,peugeot
"Huh? What insurance provider are you with? 
Or is the car on finance?

Because I just checked with my insurance provider and tuned cars are not even mentioned nor are they excluded. Also performance gains under 20% do not need to be registered with RDW, and neither is weight gain under 20%, so stage 1 is a-okay.
Stage 2 generally will need to be registered at RDW and the consequence for insurance would be the premiums go up because bhp is part of the insurance equation.

Same when adding aftermath turbo's etc as long as gain is <20% you don't need to go to the RDW and there's no reason you wouldn't be insured.",peugeot
"Join the club. It's a massive problem with the 1.2l petrol engines. I was told it's worse if you also have a Turbo.

If you have too many kms (+100000) or if the car is older than 8 years then you're shit out of luck because Peugeot doesn't care if you're a long time customer.

Lucky for you it happened before so Peugeot may (partially) intervene. In my case they didn't. Go to your dealership now or contact Peugeot customer service in your country.",peugeot
I mean DRL it self blinks faster indicator in car is obvious.  Thanks for answer.,peugeot
"Thank you so much! 

I’ve also checked the MOTs page, and my 208 has also been recalled. It was registered in January 2016 so likely all 2015 parts and materials.",peugeot
Looks like a Barry,peugeot
Maniac,peugeot
"There are plenty of red flags on this car that would make a mechanic run away before even opening the hood. For example, it says ""Peugeot"" on it lol.",peugeot
So how did everything go for you?,peugeot
OMG! ❤️ what specs?,peugeot
No the standard system. They offered CarPlay on the last model year I think?,peugeot
It will melt in the heat,peugeot
Haha I NEED THIS! Mine is missing a tail and need a new one anyway.,peugeot
"Not the day we saw it, dry day and I think the previous day was dry too",peugeot
"whats the spec? which engine?

beautiful machine you got there. have fun with it ;)",peugeot
or configuration/code that needs to be done?,peugeot
"I’ve never seen one before, no one has, but I guessing it’s a white hole!",peugeot
Luck of the draw with them then. Currently underneath one replacing an ad blue pump,peugeot
Ok my mistake. Its original and never been used!,peugeot
3 cylinder diahatsu 1.0 engine. One of the most reliable engines on the market. Chain cam and no belt. Maybe reduce the oil change interval to every 5k miles if you haven't already and keep on driving it.,peugeot
In this case I would suggest changing the door lock since the switch is in the door lock itself.,peugeot
"I get max 300km in the summer and 250km last winter, normally 230km if it’s really cold.",peugeot
"Good luck with the 1.2, hopefully it won't give you too many issues. Maybe half the oil change interval.",peugeot
"The 2.0 for sure. Unless there is proof of the 1.5 having the newer 8mm cam chain fitted (which involves a new cam box and cams etc, not just bigger chain). Both have Ad blue issues (as does basically any car with ad blue). In my experience the older car is likely to have adblue tank issues and the newer car is more likely to have dpf issues (which causes a denox system fault)",peugeot
"1.0 TU engine does all it’s timing for injection and ignition from the crankshaft position sensor, it’s on the front right at the join between the engine and gearbox",peugeot
What would you prefer as a more reliable alternative?,peugeot
Brilliant thanks a lot for your help! Will look into it,peugeot
😔last left is compression check this is done mainly for the exhaust valves. 😔 sorry to lead you on. If any of the cylinder exhibits too low or too high of a compression. There is issues,peugeot
Thank you 🙏,peugeot
"Currently own one of these beauties as well, she's got some scars because i had an accident and i kinda wanna get something a little faster/luxurious but i just can't bring myself to sell it. Such an underrated car imho.

  
(I may also have a GTI block laying around :P)",peugeot
"It is a reliable car, but the 5min commute will build up soot in the EGR valve so you will need to do some highway regularly. You could stretch to a PHEV? That would be perfect for your usage.",peugeot
Yeah you can if you like,peugeot
You said it🤣,peugeot
It’s simple it’s taped to the headliner and goes to the centre roof light unit ! Just unplugs,peugeot
"Great deal, if I lived in a house and not a flat Id be tempted",peugeot
Thanks very much 🙏,peugeot
"Panda too, solid cars n all.",peugeot
It's the new 408?,peugeot
"Good to know, I’ll try that next time🤣",peugeot
Is it a Toyota/Aisin? It'll be fine in that case.,peugeot
"I have a special version, I average 7.5 liters/100km.

The van is noisy, especially the panel van, but I think all of them are. The body is galvanized and the suspension is supple. 

Everyone says the engine is reliable, well we'll see, I guess.

I changed the radio as I wanted a reversing camera. Chances are you don't have parking sensors.

Some people even make a micro camper out of these.",peugeot
"Not exactly washed, I didn't take a pressure washer to my engine bay. Just a spray bottle of all purpose cleaner, some detailing brushes and CarPro Perl plastic dressing at the end to make all the plastic parts look pretty. Came out pretty well.",peugeot
"So i changed the diesel pump over the tank today also. I turn on ignition, but Nothing. Its not Even coming diesel into the Lines on the pump. I have checked the fuse and it looks good.. 

Anything else i can do?",peugeot
Yeah 😆,peugeot
"Still a few cheap/ish ones about
I'm eyeing one for my 2nd car",peugeot
What a picture 🤣,peugeot
"Provisional insurance is always much cheaper because learners don't try to see how fast the car can go down a blind country lane at 1AM with 3 mates in the back chugging Special Brew. 

Sorry but that car is a boy racer stereotype, I'm not surprised insurance is so high. My 2008 Scirroco (2.0 TSi 200hp) was cheaper to insure than cars like this when I last looked a few years ago.",peugeot
Yeah and it says it's on but I've never seen a light come on on the mirrors,peugeot
"Just turn it on and click the seatbelt in the driver’s seat after you clicked install, it takes ages and this way you can leave the car and won’t have to wait inside. Unless you don’t have a garage or a private driveway. 
You could just drive for at least 15min, all stuff except the entertainment screen will work fine. Oh maybe the drive settings wont work (eco,normal,sport)",peugeot
1.2 PureTech?,peugeot
👍🏽,peugeot
"To add.

A good friend of mine who is a Skoda owner and fan had more issues with his 2015 Superb and 2018 Octavia in the past two years than I had with my Renault in the past 16 years. So the “German good! French bad!” doesn’t hold up in modern cars.

Gearbox was generally vague and not very nice to use, clutch was v high even at low miles and a bit faffy. Brakes were poor compared to rivals from VAG (seat and Skoda)

Infotainment based climate controls which sucks, slow infortainment and unreliable android auto connection.

Diamond cut wheels started to corrode from the center. Dealer assured us was normal wear and tear (on a 2 year old car, always washed with premium products by hand etc..). Disappointing again, especially considering the 208 has a recall and class action against it for the same...

TBF it was good on fuel and didn't give us any large unexpected bills, although it did feel like a ticking time bomb. Owned for 30k miles and only had to do pads and tyres in that time.

A late comment on this!   
  
Trying to find a straight answer. I've got a 2016 308 with the 1.2 PureTech. Purchased by me from Peugeot in 2019 on 50k and fully serviced since then by an independent garage I use.  
  
I've done 94k in it, however in late 2019 one of the cylinders was leaking and Peugeot replaced the whole engine on warranty with a brand new one. So the engine and belt has only done 45k or so.  
  
Am I right in saying that now the cambelt interval is 62500 miles or 6 years? So I've still got a couple of years of mileage and life left in it? Chances are, it'll be sold on by then anyway.  
  
Does it matter that the engine I have is a 2019? Did they sort any of the issues by then? (not holding my breath......)",peugeot

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

"If you have an aux port somewhere in your car's multimedia/audio (It's located in the passenger glove box) I assuuuume you can do it, if it supports bluetooth.

"My first thought was stretched chain. But if that’s all been replaced then probably not. I wouldn’t worry about the fuel rail pressure too low, that’s the sort of code that appears if there’s half a second of too low pressure. Do you have a multimeter? If so then locate the camshaft position sensor and see if the sensor is getting power? If it’s had a new sensor and that’s not fixed it then there may be a break in the wire.

Edit: just read back through it and you said it’s intermittent. Get a multimeter on it and try and flex/ move the wiring to see if you can trigger any breaks.",peugeot

"Well, I can help by sharing that I own a Peugeot 308SW (2023) 1.2 130hp Puretech (EAT8 gearbox), and I can say I love it, didn't feel I was in need of more power sometime. 

Went on highways and national roads in Romania, hills, etc. with my wife and 2 small kids plus luggage. Even had a trip to Vienna. 
When I felt like I need more power, I downgraded from the padels in the back of the steering wheel (you can do that even if you are not with the selector in Manual mode and I love this feature).  But this was rare. 
I'm not a risk taker or a sporty driver either. 

Many will argue about the reliability of the 1.2 Puretech, but that is another story. (I also owned a Peugeot 2008 with the same engine, had the proper maintenance made and no issues)",peugeot

* ABS wiring harness wearing through.

For 12 Grand. It’s probably not the worst financial decision, but you may want to put some money aside for potential repairs. As all of the above are in the range of thousands of £.

"I did once get it a 22 /23 km to the liter, but most of the time it hangs around 20 km (warmer seasons). Not bad if you consider it being a 1750kg lion.

The 4wd is fine, definitely not an off-roader imo, but it gets the job done on snowy roads etc. Besides that it actually isn't a genuine 4wd, but more of a semi 4wd that cooperates (quite smoothly) with the diesel engine on the front wheels and the electric part on the rear wheels.",peugeot
"This is pretty normal for stuff like air con, lights, etc. Anything that has an additional power drain can raise your idle, especially with a colder engine. Could be your MAF sensor if it's really erratic but I doubt it if it's only going to 1K rpm.

As an aside, absolutely don't leave your engine idling from cold for 10 minutes. If you want reasons, here are reasons:

1. A diesel doesn't really generate enough heat at idle to warm up the engine to operating temperature, especially a small diesel. I did a test in my old Focus TDCi (same engine as yours) and it never hit the 88°C at idle and in some cases lost heat. That's coolant temperature too, oil temp is usually 5-10 minutes behind this in normal driving.

2. It will damage your engine. Cold oil doesn't have the same lubricating properties as hot oil, so goal #1 of starting a car in the cold is getting that oil hot, quickly. Otherwise, for all the time the engine is cold, the friction between metal components is increased, which accelerates wear and ultimately damage.

Rule of thumb; it takes 8-10 seconds to build up oil pressure in a modern combustion engine, and a further 10 seconds to build up oil pressure in a modern automatic transmission (much less if manual). If you aren't driving after that timeframe, you're causing more wear on the engine. Don't floor it from cold to get it warm faster or anything like that, just drive normally and let the engine warm up naturally.",peugeot

"Just to clarification - the actual speed dial gauge is not showing any speed (staying at 0 while driving)?   
If that's the case, either the speed sensor is the issue, or the gauge clauser it self.   
These gauge clausers are known to fail (had to replace mine 2 months ago), but best thing would be to take it to a shop and diagnose the issue, if you don't have the means to do it yourself.",peugeot

"But you see: it's not alright. It has not snapped yet, and that's about the best news of it. That fraying indicates that the belt is wearing quickly, and that some belt material will probably already be floating in your oil system. The rubber that was previously surrounding said fibres are not on that belt anymore.
Further, that belt is always covered in oil, as it (a giant design flaw) is routed through the oil sump.
Good luck, and keep us up to date ;)",peugeot

Is your clutch definitely disengaging?  When you changed the gearbox oil did you flush the clutch line through with fresh brake fluid? 

Does it go into third if you double clutch and blip the throttle to rev match as you put it in? If so it may be a worn synchro, especially if it does it more on the downshift, it’s having to work hard to increase the gear speed to match",peugeot

"Hey there! It's great to hear that you enjoyed driving the Peugeot 308 during your maintenance visit. Based on my experience, I've found it to be incredibly fuel efficient and a pleasure to drive overall. Now, regarding the Peugeot 308 (96kw, 130HP, 1.2 Puretech engine), I've been keeping track of its stats for a while now, and here's what I've got:

* Total Distance Driven: 1320.00 km
* Total Fuel Consumed: 114.12 liters
* Total Fuel Cost: 190.50 €
* Kilometers per Liter: 11.57 km
* **Average Fuel Consumption: 5.46 liters per 100 km**
* **Cost per Kilometer: 0.12 €**

Considering these stats, the Peugeot 308 seems to maintain its reputation for fuel efficiency. It's worth noting that I drive almost daily to work, covering approximately 10 km each way, and I also frequently drive on highways. As for the choice between manual and automatic gearbox, it often comes down to personal preference and driving habits. Long-term reliability and performance are key factors to consider when thinking about upgrading. Ultimately, it might be worth test driving the Peugeot 308 a bit more to see if it fits your needs and preferences. Hope this helps in your decision-making process!""",peugeot
"Yes it's still as bad.  The belt has been revised four times without a fix.  The latest hybrid 1.2's are now timing chain.

There are lots of other reliable engines out there, why risk the Puretech or Ecoboost.",peugeot

Of course it's just two examples, but it's very difficult to get true reliability ratings anyway.

The one reliability survey that is large enough to trust rates it badly among new cars, but after 5-6 years fewer problems emerge and it's rated average. Top cars are expensive ones generally as well as some japanese ones like toyota. Overall, it's down to luck, as with many cars.

I do not trust new models though, unless it has many years of warranty, in case you're thinking of buying a new one (latest 308 just came out), but there is a chance it could be good of course.",peugeot

"I drive the manual so can dip the clutch, the other way around this instead of looking at the touchscreen to see if it is on/off . Is to introduce an electric load to make the engine start, the easiest and safest way is to turn the steering wheel, this induces a load on the engine (because the power steering is an electric motor effectively). You can keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel. Next time you are stationary in traffic and the start/stop activates turn your steering wheel slightly and you will hear the engine start, to give you the idea of how it works.",peugeot

Is it a 1.4 or 1.6 hdi?,peugeot
"No, get springs made specifically for your car. The springs are made with your suspension components in mind and to support a specific weight. 

Putting springs made for a different car on your 308 is unsafe and will definitely ride like crap. It might also destroy your shocks very quickly.

They also might not fit at all if your shocks are too long / short for the springs, they might not seat correctly on the shocks or top mounts. 

The car they were made for also definitely has a different weight than your 308, so you will not get the advertised ride height. Weight is very important, it's also why springs are different depending on your engine too. Like in the case of my 407, there are springs made specifically for the diesel and gas versions, since the diesels are heavier, meaning that putting the springs meant for a car with a gas engine on one with a diesel engine will result in a lower ride height than advertised.

Depending on which country you're from, it might also be illegal. In Germany for example, doing that will definitely fail your TÜV inspection.

Lowering springs are cheap. Springs for your 308 are @150-200 euros, how much more do you want to save on the parts that support the entire weight of your car? If you want to put lowering springs on your car, then do it properly. Get yourself some Eibachs or H&Rs and new shocks (don't put the springs on your old beat-up shocks), OEM or Bilstein B4s are popular and cheap.",peugeot
