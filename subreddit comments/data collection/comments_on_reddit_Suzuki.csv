"Yes the adaptive cruise control should automatically slow down and speed up, following the car speed in front of you.
I think that under a certain speed it probably deactivate tho",Suzuki
Yeah the Grand Vitara's suck too. If you find any that work let us know.,Suzuki
I like the gxs 600r,Suzuki
Looks like an Isuzu Vehicross to me,Suzuki
Yes it is,Suzuki
Do they have the same gasket issues? I was told these 2.5L V6s have oil leak and gasket issues and to look for other motors with a tranny adapter.,Suzuki
No probs! Hope you enjoy the drive! ,Suzuki
Oooh is that the hybrid?,Suzuki
May help if you put which country you are in 😁,Suzuki

Very nice shot though",Suzuki
Thankkk you 🫶🏻,Suzuki
No need to apologize.,Suzuki
"ok after  scouring the net , i found a solution to this issue - same as yours 

 i have the same car and iphone 11 but i recently upgraded to iphone 15 and the bluetooth music stop working. What i found is that the car cant regonise the songs from spotify as music format file and doesnt play at all even tho i can do call/answer call with my phone bluetooth connected.

Solution : 

1. download itunes
2. transfer any song at least 1 mp3 music file from itunes to your phone - synchornise music , like we did the old fashion way in ipods days lol
3. now play that song in music app from your phone when you connect to the car ,it should play 
4. voila now the car recognise u have mp3 file music in your phone and will let you stream spotify normally

i just did it yesterday and so far it works fine ,if it stops working again in the next fews day i will edit this post.",Suzuki
"OMG WHAT????
I was wondering what was wrong with it because it used to work on my previous phone.
Still considering that infotainment system but this is great information
Thank you!",Suzuki
"I miss my RG 250 FG. Had it for twenty years, go for the occasional ride. I ported and polished the barrels which gave it considerably more grunt. Sold it to a work colleague and he wrote it off two weeks later. Oh I miss that two stroke zing",Suzuki
Sorry forgot to answer yesterday evening… it doesn’t make a difference. Unfortuantely I’ve already been told that the vitara indeed doesn’t offer this feature.,Suzuki
"Hayabusa, but I'm too "" fluffy"" for that riding position anymore, so I have to say the C90 Boulevard.  I don't think they're even made anymore.",Suzuki
yeah! instant buy!,Suzuki
"They are getting very popular in South Africa as well. I drive a Suzuki Dzire, and I am very happy with it after more than a year.",Suzuki
"Hi there.

I’m in the UK so gallons are different to US gallons. 

Trip computer says 47 to the gallon, mixed driving with a lot of it A road and Motorway when I need to visit the family.

I did Edinburgh to London on a full tank of fuel and was close to empty when I got finally got home.

I will guess at mid 40ish to the gallon",Suzuki
"This sort of niche knowledge is exactly what Reddit is for , some one in 7 years is gonna find this solution for their problem",Suzuki
Very nice. What's the milage? I never see them anymore in MA. They all rusted out years ago from the road salt they use here.,Suzuki
"Did you put in your car details in the search criteria?!?

I presume by the size of the calliper it'd the front brakes?

Looks nice in that red colour!,Suzuki
"Mate, I am also european, and you have no idea how much I enjoyed driving Suzuki Swift Sport ZC32S. For NA car, its a blast to drive, and I even though it had a turbo or something how quick it was. Its driving was like a detox for me, every corner is blast, and seeing some kid around my age in distance when I press pedal... Priceless.",Suzuki

Trick is to hold onto a metal part of the car before you get out.  Ie grab the door frame before your feet touch the ground.,Suzuki

"What kinda MPG are you getting from that? My Swift Sport is currently averaging 39mpg

Edit: I should add it's a 2020 non-hybrid version",Suzuki
I'm missing the same one on the same side haha,Suzuki
Some old GSXR.,Suzuki
"They're not really good, honestly.
At lower volumes they are not the worst either and not so bad.

I'm going to insulate the doors in a couple of months though. It's about 50€ per door in materials and probably 2hrs of work, shorter with every next door. 

That alone should boost speaker performance a lot, and if not, higher tier speakers that are plug and play over the old ones are 50-70€ for a pair.

If these are things that sound acceptable to you, then don't pass up on the Baleno for the speakers because it's a really good car. The only thing I dislike about it is the steering, it has some play that is annoying sometimes on the highway. For the rest, it's a good car. Which version/trim do you want to get?",Suzuki
"get a handful of these bulbs cause on japanese cars they tend to go out from time to time, and all the buttons use the same bulb:)",Suzuki
Static electricity. I get it in my Jimny if I've had waterproof trousers on and then I get out. I get a zap on the door handle. Fine with any other clothing.,Suzuki
You prob need to change the transmission filter and fluid.,Suzuki
"I love the S-Cross, solid car mate!",Suzuki
"Definitely Suzuki Swift Sport for me, be aware fuel consumption is a bit high",Suzuki
"Hello,you didn't say which generation of swifts but I'm going to go with the current gen swift (available). If rear seats down and the front seat put to the front I think you'll just fit in. It'll be a tight but not impossible. I once brought home a 2m furniture part in it, it was from windshield to windshield, also rather entertaining afterwards.",Suzuki
You can import them into the US from Mexico.,Suzuki
I thought that the vitara would be more comfortable but I guess I was wrong.,Suzuki
">Is this due to the fabric of the seats or other electrical issues?

I suspect that is the reason, the fabric.I had a Peugeot 207 CC with leather seats for 10 years and I never had a shock, now with my new Ignis I had it happen about 3 times now. I do know it happens more in cold weather than in the summer months.",Suzuki
Lol I'm missing the same piece in my sx4,Suzuki
"No, thats how it started, we tried to connect and it couldnt. Now it doesnt react to any of the buttons (not media, not bluetooth etc)",Suzuki
Anything is possible.. If you can dream it. You can build it or alter it to make it work for you.,Suzuki
Perhaps seat belt sensor on passanger seat? You keep something heavy on the passenger seat?,Suzuki
Did they not make a 1000? I spy a big pipe,Suzuki
"Good choice. I got it too for my mother.

The only regret I had was that I took with a basic radio without navigation. Mom is having a hard time operating Apple car play.",Suzuki
I wish Suzuki cars weren't illegal in the USA...,Suzuki
"Nah, yesterday i Lost power steering suddenly and it stopped responding to gas so i had it towed to suzuki repairs place. Now just waiting for the judgement of the mechanic.",Suzuki
"Even got the yoshimura exhaust, nice",Suzuki
"Yes unless there's another problem, it's supposed to do that. You'll have to fiddle with the latch from there to get it into position to open. Its to safeguard you from an accident where the bonnet could open while you're driving.",Suzuki
"If you are asking if the weather is cold then no, I'm in Australia Queensland.  So the days are around 30°c/86°f",Suzuki
GSXR 600 WR or WS or WT SRAD,Suzuki
Assuming it's diesel and cold where you are?,Suzuki
"This is the sort of curiosa that would be appreciated most by either a museum or an avid collector, probably with sentimental ties to the era and/or working a mechanic. I don't have that kind of sentiment for it so I'd probably put it up for someone who has. 

A dealer I frequent has a classics collection on display and it features tools and guides appropriate for the era along with the cars. It's a trip, found out about it only when they were selling one of their classics and then invited myself in, lol. Sounds like this would be something that could be part of the collection.",Suzuki
God the torque must be insane...i  have to try these m109 ? right ?,Suzuki
"Again wow, very thoughtful of you to provide such a comprehensive input of the car. I'll probably add Carplay to it because I'm not a huge fan of that DAB setup 👀",Suzuki
"They do sell for a lot less indeed. I asked my preferred Suzuki dealer about it and he says he doesn't really accept the saloon as a trade-in anymore because they are hard to sell again. But for me, he's keeping an eye out regardless. I like the idea of the loads of boot space and also that's its a NA engine that can easily tow a hardware store trailer. Need to haul things every now and then and would rather not do this on my tiny 3cyl turbo. Besides all that, I quite like the look of them and they're not a common sight either.",Suzuki
"The engine, yes. Im already on my second CVT",Suzuki
"thank you for replying

we are going to talk to the garage again about what is making the sensor think something is wrong

appreciate your input, thank you",Suzuki
"If they finally add the first and second generation Daihatsu Move, I’ll be getting a PS5 and GT7.",Suzuki
I loved this car wish they made newer ones,Suzuki
Gaze 600 . I had the telefónica version,Suzuki
"Oh you take a big hit to mpg. you wanted an overland build, the lift and tires gets you there.

&#x200B;

If you want a budget build, You can do what I did 2 inch suspension lift with 245/75/r16 and you can get wheeling that way. Keep in mind even this setup got me about 350km to a tank about 220 miles.",Suzuki
"It goes all the way back when Suzuki Samurai was a thing. Basically, some family member of a Consumer Report's editor crashed Suzuki Samurai, and blamed them on Suzuki. Now, Consumer Reports faked Suzuki being flipped, my modifying the moose test. And even then, it took them some time to finally ""flip"" Samurai, and when it did, they cheered it. Now, due to Consumer Reports reputation, Suzuki lost buyers, and with that controversy, they decided to abandon US, at least when it comes to cars. I think you can still buy a Suzuki motorcycle though in States. But, take all of this with grain of salt, since I may forgot a detail or two.",Suzuki
"I had a 2.7l 07, and it did worse, but I was lifted with a snorkel.",Suzuki
"I’d go Suzuki personally, French cars have a spotty reputation, also the Swift Sport will be more fun if you care about that sort of thing!",Suzuki
RF600 and RF900 looked great.  Sold my '94 RF600 and am still kicking myself.,Suzuki
"The Vitara is shorter and more narrow, and also has less ceiling clearance.",Suzuki
Suzuki 🤣🤣,Suzuki
"Yeah the bike came out of the crash surprisingly well, lots of the damage you needed to be really looking for and it was fixed after I spent a few hours in the garage. I fractured my hand somehow but other than that I’m fine",Suzuki
Wiggle the key and wheel at the same time. Sounds like the ignition switch is bad,Suzuki
There’s been a rumor that Jeep put them up to it as the Sammy being 2/3rds the cost of a Wrangler was gutting their sales. Not for nothing but there was also a large anti Japanese sentiment in the country at the time as a lot of US automakers were in a low point.,Suzuki
no point if you are modifying the vehicle. the snorkel will already take a hit to mpg with the air flow. I dont know much about the 1.6 but 10L/100 km on an AWD seems pretty good to me for 2006.,Suzuki
Beer tokens shall be provided if it leads to a successful sale!,Suzuki
Thanks all for the answers. Not as useful as I think it is. Still useful but,Suzuki
"mine has 246k km, still young!",Suzuki
Is it 3rd party?,Suzuki
"A couple of things. If it's an awd model, make sure all tires are the same. Size matters. Also, make sure your abs rings are making good contact with the sensors. Idk if the mechanics did that. Followed up by controlling the sensors with the diagnostic scanner for equal amounts of power and speed (tells which sensor is creating the code). Physically, control if there is rust or debris blocking or pushing it off its normal positioning. If you have bad bearings and the sensors are in them, it can also lead to poor contact.",Suzuki
"From my knowledge the smart hybrid system is geared mostly towards fuel efficiency, taking over electric functions on cruising speeds and helping you go quicker and more fuel efficient from a start. 

I believe that's all it does, and that it doesn't kick in when overtaking on the highway for example. But I'm not 100% sure of that. You should ask the dealer to be sure.

What I am sure of is that for more 'oompf' you'll want the turbo version of the engine.",Suzuki
Cool 👍,Suzuki
"They should bring back the 4 speed torque converter automatic transmission that they once used in the FZ NZ Swift.

I want a cheap and quirky little slushbox.",Suzuki
What car is this? Looks like streched suzuki swift... we dont have this in EU,Suzuki
Happy to send on any details required. Next time you are in you could show them and see if any interest is sparked?,Suzuki
Average price in my country (Sweden) is like 2 000$. Lower milage but might be more rust. We salt the roads etc.,Suzuki
Nice looking SX4.  They're really brilliant wee cars so welcome to the club.,Suzuki
"Thanks! You can get this design as a phone wallpaper for free on my site. No sign up needed, just download. You may check the pinned post in my profile for the link.",Suzuki
"I think that it should be legal in the UK, but the real question is if the Suzuki seat base is able to attach these parts without any welding required?",Suzuki
My first was a ‘73 TS50.,Suzuki

The swift should get more attention... Only b segment coming with awd as an option...,Suzuki
"Wait, Suzuki Jimny is in Gran Turismo 7?",Suzuki
"I managed to play-pause when I pressed the mute button. It didn't muted, but it actually paused. That was strange but at least it worked.",Suzuki
Ahhh no need to worry then! It's just indicate that a certain time/miles have passed since your last oil change. You can just take an appointment for regular maintenance!,Suzuki

"the 2.7 is suzuki. The gm variants are garbage, throw chains and burn oil. the parts availabilty will be the same, rock auto, partsavatar, lordco for the west coast but you always pay way more there.

canadian mechanics will be fine with the 2.7 its the same motor since 1999 essentially with a different intake and VVT. technically the 2.5 in grand vit and 2.7 in xl7 but very basically the same motor",Suzuki
"It's outside temperature man, in Celsius",Suzuki
"spacer lift off ebay then. Get new shocks and strut/strut mounts off rockauto. 

Tires any mud tire or a all terrain. I like kumho at51's but they may no longer make them",Suzuki
It was an extremely windy day and I had just gotten the bike the day before so I wasn’t used to it. I got blown into a curb,Suzuki
Did you switch the source on the radio to BT?,Suzuki
You can get the 4xfourart kit from the 4xfourart site but they are from europe or something. website to the usa. and then 31 or 32's.,Suzuki
SWIFT ALL THE WAY! Suzuki is a car to enjoy.,Suzuki
"Uf its a problematic thing. The first gen swift wasn’t global, so in many place it just “doesn’t exist”. So yeah, when buying that rather refer to the year than the generation.  If really unsure, send them an email about what car do they consider third-fourth gen (and send them yours).",Suzuki
"It depends what you want. 

Do you like sporty fun cars that are bulletproof? Then the Suzuki no brainer


Or do you prefer something day to day with decent reliability, peace of mind with a full warranty and better interior quality and fuel economy? 

Then get the Renault. They're 2 very different cars at different price points",Suzuki
Interior shots? Nice car btw.,Suzuki
I love my samurai and still drive it almost daily.,Suzuki
"Oo that's great, thank you for doing this !",Suzuki

It start in neutral but try to put gear and it dies,Suzuki
Yeah back when it was running I’d tear up my front yard. Little 11 year old me fixing my ripcord with paracord lmaoo. It’ll definitely be nice to see it running again. Thank you for your help!,Suzuki
"Looks like more than Two, I hate this.",Suzuki
"I had one trans went at 320K KM. Mine was lifted and abused towing above 2k trailer in the summer and wheeled it hard. I love it but at that KM
It’s yikes",Suzuki
"Most parts are interchangeable, that's the biggest pro with Suzuki, but it all depends on what parts you need, fairings will be harder to get, most mechanical parts and such are interchangeable though",Suzuki
"Yea, just got et evaluated, 1500usd for a repair and 5000usd for replacement. Its totalled haha",Suzuki
They need to bring back this engine. NA Sound and Power.,Suzuki
"My cousin's didn't, just a toggle light to show that they were on.",Suzuki
"I'm in the UK so majority of parts a readily available and chewp. Also plenty of choice from breakers for other parts not available from new.
The weakest part of these cars is the gear box, I've had mine go and it was the release bearing on the clutch. If you start hearing a whine when driving in 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc as well as a grinding noise when the clutch pedal is up and goes when the pedal is engaged, that's a tell tale sign. Mine went too far and all the bearings were shot, wish I gotna second hand one rather than a reconditioned one as I got fobbed off.
Other than that, they are absolutely solid little cars, keep on top of changing the oil/oil filter and it'll keep plodding along nicely. I'm starting to do it every 6000miles roughly 10k km as you want the timing chain to have nice fresh oil around it.",Suzuki
"Bullet proof little quad man. My first quad when I was 9 was an lt185. I loved that thing. The lack of rear suspension is a little terrifying and hurts your back at times, but that thing would go anywhere.",Suzuki
"Yeas, I checked but there are only options regarding the sound the car makes",Suzuki
It looks like a NSFW material.,Suzuki
If it did happen it happened when it was not in my ownership... I will see i mean whole engine is going to cost me 250 euros if i can manage to get it working properly great if not i will put it up for sale. I thought about engine swapping it but laws in my country are bogus for such things.,Suzuki

"If you have insurance, you should just go through that it, it will definitely be a write off in VIC.

Rear quarter damage is the worst and typically the most expensive to repair. This would be 2-3k at a guess. 

Get 3 quotes and compare.",Suzuki
"These are available through just about any decent off road shop. I had one on my Samurai, had a quick disconnect, and a bracket that just bolted on behind the spare tire.",Suzuki
Went to Costa Rica recently and saw SOOO many Jimnys!! [I want one of these so bad now I wish they sold them here…](https://imgur.com/a/fOProwq),Suzuki
Huh. That's weird. Do you know how to get into your car's internal settings? Should be accessible by pressing and holding the stalk that is similar to your odometer stalk but on the other side (with car electronics engaged).,Suzuki
Damn i was 3 in 2006😂,Suzuki
Thanks again. They just emailed back I can install it.,Suzuki
"ride by wire and quick shifter as standard, at least in Australia...",Suzuki
"The 700 and 1200 are very rare nowadays, they were already rare in the early 2000's. At least, in the European market. Can't find too much about the US market, I do know they were sold in somewhat greater numbers there. Enthousiasts over here ship parts, manuals, etc from the States. If you can get it restored, you'll have a very special bike. If not, the parts are still sought after.",Suzuki
I believe the glow plupg is a little double swirl icon.,Suzuki
It is a sensible car. It reliable and cheap to run. I just feel like I should be driving something bigger and more middle aged dad-ish.  Like a Mazda CX 5 or something similar.,Suzuki
A motor one,Suzuki
I’m pretty positive it’s not that switch but I was having to bump start it when it was running cause my starter is bad but see I live by a hill so I had somebody pull me up the road slow but we got up to like 25 mph and I tried to drop the clutch and go into 2nd and I heard the loudest clunk and since then it will start in neutral all day try to kick it in gear and it dies and fuel pump turns off fuel pump comes back on when it’s in neutral tho,Suzuki
Great shots🤙,Suzuki

"I bought my Ignis new in 2017. I love it. Such a fun car to drive. I feel like I should buy something more grown up, but I love it. Great quality too. The only thing I had to replace was the clutch last year, but Suzuki parts are cheap. Everything else is fine. Not a single rattle in the cabin or from the rest of the car. A really cool, unique looking cars as well.",Suzuki

True that,Suzuki

No but Android auto does not work with the audio dock. Only with the infotainment system,Suzuki
"Why do you want a new infotainment system, doesnt yours have apple carplay? I would suggest you buy a wireless carplay adapter (relaitebly cheap 10-15 euro in aliexpress) and fit it somewhere hidden, and voila, wireless carplay / android auto, better than a new infotainment system",Suzuki
"Hmmmmmm. Curious. I'd figure there would be something there since it's also where you can edit some of the smart entry settings.

One of the ways smart folding mirrors generally work is they fold when you lock the door with the fob. Sometimes, it's required to press the lock button twice. 
That didn't do it for you?",Suzuki

"The Vitara was a little bit more powerful but consumed a lot more fuel, and with today's prices, that's a very welcome break.

Why are you replacing the piston? What shape is the old piston in?  If the bore is good and it has a nikasil bore in good shape you'll probablly use the stock sized piston. 

There should be specs available for sizing pistons to bore and ring gap

"What kind of Suzuki and what engine does it have?

Is the fuel cap replaced with the correct cap for the vehicle? If not the emissions system won't work properly and it'll run rough.

 If it's a petrol engime you can try adding methylated spirits (about 1L to a full tank) which will help the water mix with the fuel and flush through the fuel system. Avoid making lots of short trips amd get the engine warm on some long drives when you're doing this. As a bonus you'll get a nice top end steam clean. Put the meths in each time you fill up till it runs better it should come right after a couple of tanks.

Changing the fuel filter is a good idea too, it's possible you have some rust flushed through from the tank blocking the filter which would cause running issues from the engine not getting enough fuel.",Suzuki

Hope this information helps you out a bit.

Did you try to wiggle it in and out while applying turning pressure softly? Like when a normal door doesn't open easily with the key. I'm going to guess you did anyways..

Did you also try your spare key? 
I'm asking because it's best to try just-in-case stuff before stuff is going to cost additional effort and or money.

Do you have lock/unlock on your car fob? Can you try pressing those with the key in? That worked on a friend's old Daihatsu that had electrical gremlins when it was cold.

Also maybe you can call your local Suzuki dealer in the morning to ask for advice? If it's something you can fix, they'll know. I'd try that before going the tow route.",Suzuki

Interior and tech is basic.  It will handle like a tractor compared to a refined swift sport(I have had both) Make a note take it easy on the bends and roundabouts especially in the wet as they are tail happy. Bad in corners with potholes/ ridges in the road. 

Excellent in snow and ice, you can have full faith that you can get where you need to in the snow.

Other things to check for ofcourse is rust, but you would with any 15 year old car. 

Suzukis are generally well built and should expect them to last you 20 years and 350-450k without too much hassle, especially when there's no turbos involved. Maintenance and parts aren't very expensive either, about every other brand is worse.

But make sure to do a PPI. 'Aankoopkeuring' or pre purchase inspection in English, is only €100-ish. Personally I'd do this on any 10+ year old car that I'm otherwise serious about buying. They'll also check the service history for you. If its been serviced badly, don't do it.

Some time ago when I went car shopping I also took it for a PPI and they found some issue with the ball joint / fuseekogel and two rear tires that were only just legal, I went back to the seller (dealer) and negotiated they fix it. This was also a 2k, 15yr old, 180k driven car. The car was perfect for the time I had it.

In closing, if you're buying from a garage or dealer, make sure to check reviews about them. I almost once went to buy a car at jet cars in rotterdam.......",Suzuki

"My kid inherited my 2014 SZ3 with 93k miles and it’s been the most utterly reliable car I have ever owned.

For the OP. Check the A/C works, it’s expensive to fix.
Check the service history for spark plug changes, it makes a difference.

The SZ3 does not have traction control, it’s a light car on big tyres with an impressive power output for a (wrongly) considered boring car. Kid spins the wheels a lot when it’s wet and on a hill. I did too but I absolutely love the old school cars. I want aircon and anti lock brakes, I don’t need the other stuff.

Have a look at the tyres, my SZ3 has high profile tyres on steel rims and the handling felt off on the Continental tyres that were fitted as new. 

After a few tyre changes, got a set of Falken fitted which transformed the driving experience.

I’m not promoting Falken but with big high profile tyres, you need to look at sidewall stiffness and the stiffer the sidewall, the more ‘natural’ the car feels on fast sweeping bends.

The audio system is fairly easy to upgrade, speakers are pretty decent for casual listening and you can get a double DIN replacement for under £200, they sell replacement trim packages to help it blend back into the car - Had to do this for kid as the standard radio lacks inputs.

My last MOT had a few advisories, all for suspension repairs which I would say is because of the roads I drive on are terrible. I had the oil changed last month and the mechanic said he was surprised how clean it looked for 8k miles. It gets about 47mpg (uk) combined which is about 6l km.

"Ahhh you're in India? We're not getting the new generation in Europe and there's been no Baleno for sale since '19. So I'm talking about the previous generation, and I can't speak for the new one. Then ironically, the version I have wasn't sold in India. Closest would probably be the RS for the engine or Alpha for trim, it's got the 1.0 Boosterjet but with 10 more horsepower and it has adaptive cruise control too. 

Anyhow I'd say if you like the car, go for it, audio upgrades and some sound dampening doesn't need to be way expensive to give a satisfying sound upgrade. Maruti used to list suggested upgrades for speakers too.

The dampening is very important at least for the previous generation, the speakers use the door the same way a acoustic guitar does and the thin metal benefits from some materials put onto it. I'm not sure but don't expect the new generation Baleno to be different in this regard.

"Yes, sorry, poorly explained. I can pull the lever in the car and the bonnet opens a bit, but the latch under the bonnet is stuck.",Suzuki
I was less than 1 …,Suzuki
Looks like if you told ai to make a car,Suzuki
"Nope.

Love the concept of the car particularly the awd model but I just cannot get over the looks.,Suzuki
"And now I got my eyes on the Jimny, hopefully! The Swift still stays hehe.",Suzuki
"Haha me neither. But my father happened to have ordered what he thought was a key fob cover from AliX, but was in reality an uncut key. The VW/brand markings were way off on that one too.",Suzuki
"I tried doing that, whenever I clicked it, it just wouldn’t switch on with my phone connected, however it worked with my mom’s phone",Suzuki
good for another 200k,Suzuki
Ahhh thank you. I’ve never seen Suzuki spelled that way.,Suzuki
Gotta love a Gixxer. Paint it red so it goes faster.,Suzuki
"M1xA Series is very sensitive to overheating, if the car overheated once to the point where the warning lamp was flashing then its usually already too late for it.",Suzuki
"I have this vague recollection of having This problem and the solution was that the phone needed a song for it to be recognised as a music player.

I was trying to uses Spotify at it wouldn’t connect.

Might not be your problem but it’s worth a try.",Suzuki
"Only visible rust is on the towing receiver. Rockers and fender flares look clean in the photos. It is overpriced right now 5,500 cad. If I checked it out I’d like to offer 4000$",Suzuki
So is @womanrespecterMD lmao,Suzuki
Never mind I figured it out. The button between the map lights IS for the sunroof but if you don't have a sunroof the button is still there but you can't press it.,Suzuki
"Wow! This gives me confidence that this car is really underrated that people might say in my country. 

Parts procurement are really bad tho, Japan only.",Suzuki
"you need whats called a impact wrench, or a impact ratchet, both do the same thing by using a hammer assembly to hammer away at the anvil to make it rotate, like taking a hammer to the back of that allen key only much more effecient.

these bolts have been torqued & it requires a hard shock to break the seal, impact tools will do that otherwise you need to put a hollow bar over your allen key so you can get more leverage to turn the key,

Be careful with where you put your hands and where you possibly may slip to, use a long enough bar so your knuckles clear the heat sink.",Suzuki
The CD button was pushed and that made it froze.. we hit it (physicslly) a couple times that unstuck it and that helped :),Suzuki
I can tell you it can definitely be overworked. inefficient motor for the size Ive had a 2.7 XL7 and 2.5 gv,Suzuki
Listen whipper snapper...,Suzuki
It is the driver side brake mount. Sorry that I didn’t include that important piece of information!,Suzuki
You could try to ask a Suzuki dealership the history of services and inspections. At least during the years when the warranty was valid.,Suzuki
The instrument panel uses LEDs afaik. They are quite common to go out unfortunately. There are some companies that fix the individual LEDs so you can keep the original cluster instead of replacing it. You could also try and do it yourself if you have experience in soldering LEDs.,Suzuki
"Not specifically. When I checked the front left, which was the 3rd wheel I checked, it dragged a lot so had a glance through the wheel at it. I couldn't properly see the state of it nor if there was a certain amount of space between the pad and the ""inside-wheel"". In the meantime I made an appointment for friday at a garage to let it checked out to see what the problem is.
If I can do something in the meantime I'm very happy to do so, so any tips are welcome.

Also, I'm sorry for my lack of mechanic skills and vocabulary. It's my first adventure trying to fix a car so I'm extremely beginner level. 😅",Suzuki
I am well versed in the PNW of Canada with these machines. If it popped from 4l I'm sure something had popped it . sometimes its a good idea to put it in N and roll back a few feet if you feel bound up. Hopefully you didn't break anything. but if you do lots of climbs with lots of weight a toyota or a truck may be better. a little 1.6L-2.5L Depending on your motor wont be happy climbing for long long periods.,Suzuki
Vaporwaveee,Suzuki
"I don't know if it has the option for auto-folding mirrors. Dis you check your owners manual?

You'll get used to the keyless entry and especially the engine start very quickly to the point where inserting a key and turning it feels antiquated, haha.",Suzuki
Cheers!,Suzuki
If one wheel is dragging more than the others you may have a stuck brake caliper.,Suzuki
"I believe Thats a non critical engine warning light. (Though not positive)

They usually come on when theres an issue with an electrical system somewhere in the vehicle.

If it happens while going over bumps and whatnot, it could indicate a loose connection somewhere in the vehicle.   

It could be as simple as a loose battery terminal.  Thats actually the first place I would check.

If that doesn’t work and you aren’t familiar with tracking down electrical issues in vehicles, I suggest taking it to a mechanic.",Suzuki
"I love my ignis too. Grateful to no longer be on a service plan with the dealership now it’s three years old as Barry the service guy is a complete wanker. 

I’m amazed at how much shit I can actually fit into the car. Am a market trader with dogs that come with. Dogs, gazebo, stock, tables. All comfortably wedged in.",Suzuki
Match a bolt up to the other one ..,Suzuki
"Wow thank you so much for your input. You certainly do feel the inconsistencies of the roads and sound insulation isn't top-tier but I'll be looking to attach some sound proofing like I did with my Swift Sport.

Had no idea about the rust issue so will heed your advice on that.

It's certainly a car I could live with as a daily driver if I had to...but will probably be used as an alternative",Suzuki
I also asked on the Renault sub :)),Suzuki
3 I think,Suzuki
"Hi where did you get your workshop manual ? 
As coolent you can look at compatible cars on the back of coolent bottle. Maybe you can find another coolent that's getting the job done.",Suzuki
Think it’s a Kawasaki,Suzuki
"Ypu alright though, eight? That is what mostly matters, plus, the damage on a bike seems little to none",Suzuki
"Bluetooth will work.... Also the type of radio installed is the determinant of the aux feature. If you really need the aux, consider replacing the radio. Imo.",Suzuki
"As a family, we have two Suzukis and a Toyota.

Suzukis have personalities, the Toyota is a big lump of indestructible metal, I’m not knocking Toyota, it does exactly what I need but I’ve driven vans with more spark.

My kid has inherited my base model 2WD SX4 and as part of the curriculum, has to turn up at farms for the course, usually in awful weather at dawn.

Said kid, trundled up an uphill path one morning, it was more mud than road and didn’t have any issues.

Upon arrival, the farmers were impressed and had tractors ready to pull the better off kids 4x4s up the hill.",Suzuki
"Ah, bummer. No sunroof, hope you didnt buy it and they told you it had one😅 happens a lot apparently",Suzuki
"Awesome off road average on road, Parts are cheap and they are quite easy to work on. Mine sits around 10/100 before accounting for tyre size with a bullbar, 31's, 2"" lift, reduction gears and roof bars",Suzuki

Buy an original one from Suzuki. I think that current color is blue.,Suzuki
"Yeah, I was kind of expecting that... I will search who can replace them in the NL.
Thanks a lot",Suzuki
"I had a similar winding noise when in gear but only off throttle w my 2008 swift on only 82k. 

In my case it was the bearings inside the gbox. But it could also be a problem with the seal and/ or transmission fluid leak or a failure in almost any of the components in the box or clutch. 

Tlrdr; because gearboxes are complicated you should probably show it to a trusted mechanic, and a repair is in most cases likely to be relatively expensive",Suzuki
"Ok, thanks! Odd choice because all the other switches are backlit",Suzuki
"Cheers, I've owned this one for 6 years and it's been amazingly reliable.  The GLX gives you keyless entry/start, 15"" alloys, climate control and the ground effects kit which is side skirts and front rear bumper skirts. (uk spec) 

Repair wise it's needed a front wishbone, a few brake pipes, an alternator, battery and front brake discs and pads.  All wear and tear stuff.  Still pretty low mileage for age at 91k though.

Honestly, if you can find one snap it up.  I've seen decent looking SX4's for sale with 150k miles on the clock for not a lot of cash.  Here in the UK these saloons are very rare and the boot/interior space is huge. The saloons usually sell for less than the hatchback too.",Suzuki
"head gasket is very rare on the 2.5 and 2.7. They do leak from the valve covers almost every motor suzuki has made for us has had the issue. 

&#x200B;

You don't have a lot of room in the engine bay, so its tough to try and swap. the 2.7 if you are swapping may as well do a bunch of gasket work while its on the engine stand.",Suzuki
"Suzuki made the TL1000 back then, no gsxr1000s tho. 

Saw a guy on a TL1000 rolll a wheelie into the back of a car in Seattle at a Moto event at 99aurora in Seattle . Everybody saw it coming. 20plus years ago",Suzuki
"It looks like, either a 1999 GSX-R 750 or 1000. If my memory is good. The VIN is on the head stock, the steering pivot. Do I VIN search and get all the info you need.",Suzuki
"I suspect it has something to do with this, as it relates to consumer taste and types of vehicles you share the road with in the US:

Did you look at the brake pads when you jacked the car up to check wheel bearing play?,Suzuki
Don't worry I probably need more specific measurements. I'll find one IRL and compare them. Thanks though.,Suzuki
Check with the scrap parts networks. In this day and age you'll have parts websites that you can use to find specific parts and it'll source from all connected scrappers in the country. What country are you in?,Suzuki
"Not OP, but I've had my 1.6L 2008 SX4 sedan (also with the fancy package) for close to 5 years now and I have zero regrets. It's one of the most reliable cars on the road. I'm at 186K kilometres and I reckon I can easily get to 300K. My only issue is the support between the two front side windows, because they create quite a noticeable dead zone. It's nothing major, but you do need to pay a little extra attention.",Suzuki
Because it is.,Suzuki
I was going to do that anyways because android auto doesn't work either but thanks.,Suzuki
"I actually haven’t tried that yet. I assumed it was the car itself, since I can’t switch the radio to Bluetooth on my phone, but I’ll try play something on youtube",Suzuki
Yeah but that only mutes. Doesn't restart Bluetooth music or pause it.,Suzuki
"Old GW 2,5l has lots and lots of engine for a lightweight body and is generally really good for climbing. It's the part-time 4x4 I am worried about, because the ground is often rocky and does not slip much.",Suzuki
That engine is well know for timing chain issues. But if they were done you should have been sweet.  Pretty sure it's made in Australia too.,Suzuki
Got it open. Locking mechanism was rusty. Managed to wriggle a bit and got a screwdriver in to force unlock.,Suzuki
Sports Fairing V-Twin,Suzuki
"Well with the front bumper he has, it gives clearance in the front. the control arms from the kit push the wheels out a bit as well. theres not much to cut on the front wheel well closest to the driver, its tight.",Suzuki
Anywhere in between the two dots is perfectly safe. Engines and dipsticks are designed so that a variance in oil level is safe for the engine. Your oil level is basically in the perfect safe spot and still looks pretty clean.,Suzuki
Ask the dealership.,Suzuki
"Not a very helpfull comment I guess, but I just had a look in the 2017 handbook for the Vitara (in Dutch). It says that when you replace the wheels and put new sensors in, then the sensors need to be programmed by a Suzuki dealership. There is no procedure described.  
Maybe you can try and copy the IDs from the original tires to the new set?

  
(Note: I do not have a Vitara, but a Swift and it does not have the TPMS system. Just trying to help)",Suzuki
The Bluetooth fm transmitters work good,Suzuki
"Quite a lot of milage. How is the rust situation? Also, this should be a super cheap deal imo for it to be worth it. 

With that said. Ill take a well maintained high milage car over an abused newer one any day",Suzuki

"Had a Suzuki Splash 1.0 3-cylinder 68HP from 2013 to 2018 and drove it around 136k km and had no problem with the engine what so ever (only problem I ever had was that the boot release was not working but that was fixed quickly by replacing the handle).

I now have a Swift 1.0 BoosterJet 3-cyl 111HP from 2018 and also had no problems with the engine (or other stuff). Currently at around 48k km.

Both are manual transmission, so can't say anything about the CVT, but the 3-cylinder engines from Suzuki appear to be really well built.",Suzuki
It's a Suzuki and will therefore be fine.,Suzuki

i want the new jimny BAD. chrysler paid the consumer reports to lie about the tipping bc they couldnt have their precious wrangler get beaten out sales wise by a jap jeep.

"Apparently you could gain 11hp and 14nm through chiptuning if you have the 1.2 hybrid.

Not much else you'll be able to about it's power and speed honestly.

Maybe there's an aftermarket turbo kit but that's the point where everything you do is going to cost serious amounts of (time and) money.

The tuner scène does alot of fun things with the new Ignis, including lowering, different bumper and grill to alter the appearance, if that's your thing. It's huge in India.",Suzuki
"I have the 2013 SX4 [4wd] with Automatic CVT transmission. So I guess I can't help ya.

All I can say is I love this car I would pay anything to fix it if it ever broke, never gives me any issues, just put a new Timing chain in at 120K miles as a preventative",Suzuki
"No idea, on my Wagon r+ i had to turn the dials of my lights to ""on"" for the front foglights to 'latch' on.",Suzuki
Yeah you gotta remove and drain the gas tank. Best to let it dry and then splash some hydrachloric acid around in it and let it dry again. Consider yourself lucky for not having hydrolocked your engine already. You should probably bleed your whole fuel system too,Suzuki
My bad sorry,Suzuki
"It does have backlight! not being a sport, it might not be red at night, but there is one more bulb in the switch, aside from the green ON light.

you'll need to head under the dash, then find your way to the back of the panel, then squeeze from the top and bottom to release the button. Take a large flathead screwdriver and unscrew quarter turn the centre ""screw"" on the side. you'll need to keep the lightbulb rubber coloured cover and put it on the new bulb ( L16-12/60  or T1) then wire the terminal wires back how it originally was.",Suzuki
I had the 2023 Swift hybrid manual version and it's a really good car. I've switched to the swift sport now and of course is a superior vehicle on every front.,Suzuki

I want one 😂,Suzuki
For the 750^. The 600 SRAD is carbed until 2001,Suzuki
Ah that settles it then. I know it's an option on the newer Vitara's though but they can also be put in aftermarket.,Suzuki
"It's concerning, the light indicates a low oil pressure, not necessarily caused by a low oil level, it could be the oil pump, or the filter, or even dirty oil. You have to take it to the nearest mechanic. Are your sure it's the oil pressure light and not the oil change reminder?",Suzuki
Yeah they consider the first gen swift then. If they dont answer id say get it (the IV) because the year matches. I hope for the best for you.,Suzuki
Damn it looks nice!,Suzuki
Suzuki is a pretty popular brand in New Zealand… lots of swifts everywhere… as well as other models,Suzuki
"I will have a good look after work tomorrow, thank you.",Suzuki
"Might be Suzuki, idk tho kinda looks and built like one.",Suzuki
Sx4 is the most common Suzuki you will see in the states but 99% of the time it's a hatchback.,Suzuki
might try a shop. unfortunately suzuki stopped selling vehicles in canada years ago so there are no dealerships anywhere near me. but i'lls see what i can do. thank you!,Suzuki
By centre console do you mean an arm rest thing? I have a 21 ignis and it just pops into that random cup holder behind the hand brake.,Suzuki
If you think you have a problem you should take your car to the dealership or authorised mechanic and they should fix it for free since the car is still in warranty.,Suzuki
"Thanks. That's what I'm thinking. Because the list says Swift IV but with the years from 2004>2010 
Since mine is 2008 that would be it. 
I'll send them my pictures and ask them again. Shot a message yesterday, but no answer so far",Suzuki
Non-hybrid version 🥰,Suzuki
"It only slows down and accelerates, it doesn't fully stop or start driving automatically",Suzuki
"The second one should be right next to the oil pan. I just fixed my P0420, but for me I had to swap out the catalytic converter. Swapping both of the O2 sensors didn't fix it. Hopefully it's just the sensor for you though.",Suzuki
"Dangggg, it looks sickk",Suzuki
I had a Gsxr 600 SRAD what a great bike. Large feul tank meant extra 50miles over my mates Kawazaki and Hondas.,Suzuki
Duh it's a fast yellow Suzuki🤪,Suzuki
"Weird, my best guess would be that i see the cd button being pressed, maybe that disallows the other controls?",Suzuki
"Again, thanks for the explanation! 

Do you know if the instrument panel uses the same bulbs?
I also have a few dead lights there :')",Suzuki
"came here from your post in Chinatime. Wow, you have good tastes in cars too! Wish we could get the Swift here in the U.S.",Suzuki
"Haha you know what I should look for these too, its been years without them. I'll let you know if I find anything, thanks for the reminder xD",Suzuki
"Hahaha yeah
It confused me so much why it wouldn’t work on my iphone but worked with a samsung.
I figured it was an issue with my phone or something:)))",Suzuki
"Unless you're the original owner, my guess would be this is a blank key from China that has been cut (other key copied onto).",Suzuki
"Looks like a Sport 50M12 to me, do some googling on that model and let me know if I was right!",Suzuki
"I keep eyeing these up as a upgrade to my Vitria, I think it looks nicer.",Suzuki
thats what i was thinking as well. i did a deep dive into google and youtube about it yesterday and that seems to be what i found.,Suzuki
"Check the service history, has water pump, cambelt, transmission and gearbox been replaced serviced?

The gear linkages can go as well on the Swift Sport 2012+ can go but that's easy to replace and costs pennies",Suzuki
"Thank you, a friend od mine took them :)",Suzuki
No it's the oil change reminder,Suzuki
"Yup, same thing with the SX4.",Suzuki
"I'm old, so I like the Van Van or TC-90. If we are talking dirt bikes though, by far the 1979 rm400",Suzuki
"Yeah the offset is actually the problem. 

Found out you need a double ended box wrench. 

Have zero idea where one can be purchased by itself",Suzuki
"Reliable, easy to service and quite fun to drive. They drive a lot like you would expect - bit of road noise and you have to control it over bumps etc at high speed with the short wheelbase. Really a 2 seater, 3 at a push. Ours is lifted 2"" which improved handling a bit - the factory spring/shocks are a bit soft and allow a bit of sway in the corners. Do rustproof it with lanolin or penetrol etc, suzukis aren't famous for their rust resistance. The upright grill/screen collects chips in paint & glass easily but no biggie.",Suzuki
"I love in SEA, still dring a CVT Swift Dzire. Very fuel efficient and holding up well. Not the best air conditioning though. And not the fastest defo. Very vanilla on highways.",Suzuki
"No I don’t think they ever made a 1000 in that body, correct me if I’m wrong.",Suzuki

"Thank you! It has been my car since High School, and now in Medical School. 

It's funny and endearing that a car is the only one who really witnesses your growth. 

Saw your Bulova on the Watches subreddit! It's a really good looking watch. Might already consider buying a diver.",Suzuki
"Also, I appreciate your effort, and time for helping me find the part. I’m not much of a car guy, haha. I only know so much, and every car is different. I don’t want to get there wrong part or anything, because I’ve done  it couple of times",Suzuki
Sounds good - i have a similar issue... could you supply a link for one such device?,Suzuki
Sounds like a fire hazard if filling the tank and the air has enough gasoline mist. I would try to cover those seats with at least faux leather or something.,Suzuki
"It's very nice but too expensive here where I live, about us$34000",Suzuki
"thank u!! what model do you have? i’m getting the 2024 GLX and im thinking of upgrading the speaker system if i didn’t like it, as i like the features of the car and it fits my needs and budget.",Suzuki

And that would be awesome but I don’t know what that part would be called lol",Suzuki
"Yes it’s a 4cyl. In EU, engine is the K14D",Suzuki

I'm gonna drive one this week but i'm just scared lol

I think its a beautifull car so i really wanna fit",Suzuki
Perfect cheers mate!,Suzuki

Buy a petrol one. Check the condition of the catalytic converter.,Suzuki
"It's based on Keicar after all, so not overly big, body is a litle narrow. But it's on the limits of how big they can be, so should be fine. Not sure about Jimny but other Keicar Suzukis have wider area for the driver",Suzuki

"GS 500, the working mans bike, i never had one, but i always wanted it for some reason.",Suzuki
"If you're into your music you'll probably want to upgrade the sound system - we replaced the speakers in ours and added front tweeters and put a pair of subwoofers under both front seats, its fantastic now haha",Suzuki

"I agree, I prefer all my switches to be backlit if it can be helped. Engineers/Designers aren't always consistent though...",Suzuki
"You would have to ask your dealer for the price as the importer doesn't show them online.
In the UK the price of the lower gril alone is £102/120€.

As long as its not damaged most parts can be made to look like new with either good cleaning and dressing (ask r/detailing) or since they're disassembled anyways, some paint. 

I don't know the reason for preferring all new, but, don't let perfect be the enemy of good on a 10+ Yr old car.",Suzuki
I can’t turn the key to start the engine 😕,Suzuki
"My expierence as a big guy in suzuki is the roof is quite tall, and the seat goes back far enough but width can be tight in one. Ive had 93,01,06 and they get tighter the newer they are with the console in the middle. Ive never tried a new jimmy as I'm in Canada",Suzuki
"Dude don't ask me lol.  Don't know why I put either, it's been a long day. I fixed it",Suzuki

"I would go for petrol honestly, its an old habit, diesel engines have too much stuff going on...",Suzuki
Gsxr 600. Right way up forks. 750 had usd forks.,Suzuki
On that road 4hi would not go. Too steep. It also happened on descent while engine braking on a steepest segment. I have not had any issues under lower loads.,Suzuki
Addition: bike carrier is a tailgate carrier.,Suzuki
"Don't know, even after 13 years, I still love it so much. I'm also one of the only ones driving a Swift this colour in my area. It's great 😁",Suzuki
"Says it on the bike , Suzuki GSXR 600 or 750cc based on the width of the rear tire n a bit older model prob like a 2000 or somewhere around there cause the newer ones have a wider rear tire",Suzuki
