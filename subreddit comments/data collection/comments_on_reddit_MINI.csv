"NICE roof!

Matching white stripes are cute too!",MINI
i love the original guages and setup,MINI
"FWIW, I prefer the greater accelerator pedal sensitivity of Sport mode, which seems to minimize the ""turbo lag"" effect of the way power is initially limited (to avoid wheelspin and reduce strain on the drivetrain).


Note that only Green+ really forces energy conservation.",MINI
Can you actually push the button? LOL,MINI

Ah yes let's embrace fast consumerism at the expense of others' lives,MINI
That's the perfect green.,MINI
"Yes of course i do agree with you that if I like it, it dose not matter what other people think. However reviews can be helpful too maybe know of potential future problems and it also helps me narrow which cars I want to test before I decide. I appriacte your comment though",MINI

"This happened on Monday.

I was driving northbound on i15 in Las Vegas near the US 95 interchange.  The car I was following had to slam on his brakes due to the vehicle in front of him coming to a stop, so I also had to stop as well.

I'm not entirely sure where the person was that rear-ended me, he said that he was checking his blind spot to merge over and wasn't paying attention to the road in front of him.  I don't remember seeing him when I checked my mirror.

We made it out okay, bruised and a little bit banged up.  No spinal injuries.  His insurance company has accepted responsibility, however, I'll be pursuing this through mine as I had replacement insurance on my car.",MINI
The side markers don't take bulbs they're just reflective strips.  I already thought of that,MINI
Yes it is üò≠ I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase,MINI
If you set your MPG display to show realtime consumption then you can see if it is a DPF regen when it happens as the fuel consumption rises massively.  I know you can change the MPG to show realtime on my F56 so hopefully you can on yours too.,MINI
Why can no one on this sub park....,MINI
What code do you get when you scan the car?,MINI
Thank you. When I first brought the car to him in January I showed him the build up in the cap and he said it wasn‚Äôt an issue just due to the weather but now he has said it‚Äôs due to potentially head gasket blowing due to the constant coolant leaks :/,MINI
"Satin is just the finish, it‚Äôs in between matte and gloss. Primer is just so the top coat can adhere to the object. The top coat is what gives the final layer of protection I think. I haven‚Äôt tested mine through a carwash yet but I haven‚Äôt had any damage from everyday driving or weather. 

You could always add a protective clear coat on top of the top coat for a final layer of protection.",MINI
I do have folding mirrors on my 19 Clubman Cooper S,MINI
No way! Really?,MINI
"I also have a 2006, ordered new, but with 102k miles. My issue is the oil leaks‚Ä¶ I am not sure if I should bother w the repairs or if I should finally sell it. It was my first car out of college.¬†",MINI
"TBF, they've shared components for quite some time now.",MINI
"I love it!!! This is the color I wanted but I‚Äôm not sure it exists for the generation I was targeting haha (R57). Eventually found a car that checked every box except for the dream color and decided to go for it anyways.

But you actually got it!!",MINI
"I‚Äôd never put a JCW badge on my car.  It‚Äôs an S but I‚Äôll entertain the red stripe for aesthetics, not for any other reason.  I get the point a few of you make but if you do the math on the responses here most folks like the idea of dechroming with the red stripe. I‚Äôll be sure to get vaxed for imposter syndrome before I add it though. üòÜ",MINI
"To clarify on ""if the result is good"": as others have mentioned, there may still be some ghosting from the vinyl. I don't see anything significant from the parts that have already chipped off, but this is just a picture so it may be noticeable to you and not us. In the case that there is, some polishing might be able to fix it, since it's usually oxidized clearcoat in the case of white paint if it's yellowed. Three other solutions if this isn't working is repainting it, having the roof wrapped, or using the ghosting to help align another union jack",MINI

"The one with the nose off was the wrecked donor, that‚Äôs how we got the car.
I never took the nose off of the blue one, everything comes out the bottom.",MINI
"Hi Roy, my name is Charlie Cooper",MINI
"Nice shots! [My recent ones](https://www.reddit.com/r/MINI/s/RPAGI1ywY5) were in front of graffiti too, so you can compare with how I did mine as well.

What kind of camera are you working with? Are you stuck with an iPhone like me or do you have something with interchangeable lenses?

In both cases lighting is the biggest thing to consider because it affects the look of your car a lot and also happens to be something you have to plan around as well.",MINI
Kia looking ass car,MINI
I miss my BRG!  Nice.,MINI
"I have a black Mini and it‚Äôs easy to keep clean. It doesn‚Äôt get that dusty look, and anyway you can make a Mini look spotless in about 15 minutes as there‚Äôs not much to clean! 

Hope you love your new Mini.",MINI
I know but It would looks so cool,MINI
"I am always extra careful no matter who I park next to cause I don't want to ding my car, or damage theirs. I don't need that on my insurance",MINI
Good design is meant to be subtle,MINI
Which ones yours?,MINI
"I don't live in Vegas, I'm actually near the coast in California between LA and San Francisco, but even here, temperatures in the summer can reach nearly what they do in Vegas for extended times.

This Mini was my only car and I drove it everywhere, even used it for a road trip last summer to just outside of Columbus, Ohio and back.  6300 miles total as I had to make a detour to Grand Forks, North Dakota to pick up a friend of mine.  It was a comfortable ride the entire time, sure I could have flown but then it wouldn't be much of a story.

While trips like that weren't ordinary, I did travel to Los Angeles, San Franciso, and Las Vegas semi-regularly.  I'm around 230 miles from the SF or the LA area and 400 miles from Las Vegas.  The lack of space for these trips is why I'm not sure if I'll get another F57.  It's a fantastic car, had it been a second car I'd get another F57 without hesitation.",MINI
"Prob use the 85mm, and 35 if you wanna get a lot of the background and surroundings in the frame. The 35mm is great for diagonal 45 degree angle shots of the car where you‚Äôre trying to make it look angular or show where the car is situated close to something like a cool sign. The 85mm will give the car bigger presentation and if you have something cool like a tree far away from the car but lined up in the shot, the 85mm will make it appear closer. The 85mm gives you the option to use limited depth of field and blur the background for an artsy portrait look. 

Lighting: Make sure there‚Äôs no confusing shadows on the car, that kills the photo. Midday sun can be difficult to work with for this reason and also the very strong highlights coming off the car. Times of day like sunrise and sunset, just after sunset when there‚Äôs still light out are best for avoiding weird shadows. 

There‚Äôs a whole other bunch of advice around picking a good location and framing a good shot. Also things like washing and waxing your car help reflect light you might want. Cars are challenging because they act as a giant mirror when they‚Äôre shiny, so they tell you what‚Äôs not in the photo frame, which can be inconvenient if it‚Äôs ugly.",MINI
It can be realible if you maintain it lol,MINI
Wow that's a nice one. Way to keep it in good shape.,MINI
"Lifetime of random electrical issues. They‚Äôll manifest in weird ways. Random error codes when the main components in that circuit check out perfectly fine. Opening a door causes a misfire code being registered. Not to mention the mold under the carpet. Sure, it looks all shiny and new. But insurance companies total water damaged vehicles for a reason. Consider yourself lucky you know it‚Äôs water damage up front.",MINI
If you‚Äôre in the market for rpf1‚Äôs let me know üôåüèº,MINI
"It's the battery vent hose.  The original factory battery would have had a fitting for it to fasten to, but it's possible that both the battery you removed and the new battery you installed are completely sealed and don't have a vent.",MINI
"Since mine was a lease buy back and I have not had I that long, I found that the HUD was already at position six and I don‚Äôt think anything by else is in there. Now I‚Äôm inspired to add one for sport displays, Spotify and addresses",MINI
Fantastic color!,MINI
"The 2018 will be a 3rd Gen, which have proven to be great cars. The 2014, is a late 2nd Gen, so should have an N18 engine which is an improvement over the rather disastrous N14.  I'd personally buy the 3rd Gen model. Regardless, watching your fluids religiously is a good practice with these cars.

Your familiarity with BMW will serve you well. 3rd Gen minis are really just BMW's that look like Minis. B48 under the hood, a re-skinned version of iDrive, etc.",MINI
"you almost got the exact same spec as mine lol, nice JCW enjoy it!",MINI
I love the feeling when accelerating and it seems I‚Äôm wiggling on ice. Hope I don‚Äôt break anything,MINI

"Stick a mini  badge on it and they're ""great""stick a dacia badge on it everyone would call it one of the all time ugliest cars... a disgrace of a car",MINI
"Are there problems with the gas or electric models over the last few years, say 2023 - Now? 

I‚Äôm also considering getting my first Mini this year or next and I‚Äôm curious what the mini experts here think.",MINI
"You‚Äôll be fine with the work charger. No problem replacing the ~70% in 4 hours. Charging at home would also be a good idea for the weekends/vacation. 

Our SE is our second car and I regularly cart around one (or both) of our kids (7 &9). A 2-door isn‚Äôt the best, but just push the front passenger seat all the way up and get a protector for the back. The only thing that really stinks is getting the booster in and out. If you plan to keep it back there then it‚Äôs NBD. 

Overall, it‚Äôs a terrific little car. Fun to drive, zippy, and mostly physical buttons for all the right things. Now that my kids are getting a bit bigger I‚Äôm thinking of moving to a Polestar 2 for the extra doors. If I just had 1 kiddo, I‚Äôd probably stick with the SE.",MINI
The 1-6 buttons below the screen in the center console,MINI
"Well, I just learned which part was the scoop. And is this a clubman?? Thanks for the example- I am debating bonnet stripes on mine. No to the red mini badge.",MINI

"That was a nice car, too bad. Hopefully you are okay. At least now you can get the new one",MINI
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a he.,MINI
Can you explain why?,MINI
Because the car hasn‚Äôt moved in months since the kid driving it blew its transmission.,MINI
üòç,MINI
"It‚Äôs probably not the head gasket as mentioned before. These engines tend to leak coolant at the thermostat housing, oil filter housing (is water cooled) or the crosspipe at the back of the engine. 
The milky oil in the cap could be short rides in colder weather. Condensation does not evaporate and causes that milky substance. 

Don‚Äôt know at what rate it consumes or looses coolant. All of the aforementioned issues aren‚Äôt cheap either. But could be worth checking out. Google for how to check each and cross them of the list.",MINI
"Not true. I‚Äôve cleared this fault. DO disconnect the battery when removing/reinstalling the seat as to not accidentally set off any airbags. 

In my case I didn‚Äôt fully seat the wiring connection when I reconnected the battery and turned on the car. Thought I was fucked, but was pleasantly surprised when I was simply able to reset the code with my Foxwell scanner.",MINI
Also if you are going to repair it make sure to use genuine parts. I had my thermostat replaced with a cheaper copy parts and it caused havoc. Had to replace it again with a genuine one.,MINI
They both have the mini emblem all over them. It‚Äôs funny trying to discount the clubman or countryman. Does the four door hardtop count?,MINI
I‚Äôm glad to read things like this. I‚Äôve a 2011 countryman and reading this forum it should completely fall to pieces every time I drive it and I need to budget $5k every 6 months for repairs.,MINI
üá©üá™,MINI
Thanks!! Much appreciated.,MINI
I ordered one of these and can confirm it works fantastic also less than half the price of the cravenspeed one,MINI
"Oil cap build up doesn't mean coolant. It can. But on these its more commonly you aren't driving long enough to evaporate the moisture that occurs when the engine cools down or the pcv system isint doing its job effectively.
No coolant loss, and black or golden not milky oil.
Not boiling out of the coolant tank or oil in coolant tank you don't have a head gasket problem.",MINI
"grille stripe fuck yes, logo hell no.

not sure about the hood scoop. part of me thinks you should make that red too",MINI
"I‚Äôm not going to touch the badge.  I‚Äôll leave it black.  The second image is just Photoshopped. The red adds a lot, IMHO. üëçüèª",MINI
These are the only good ones I have so far :) I'll post again if I have better ones though!,MINI
That's one sick mini üòéüòé,MINI
"If you're wanting a modern MINI as the basis and you have the budget, a 2020+ Clubman JCW is where I would start. AWD, very capable B48E engine. I imagine with the right tune, fuel, and mods, low 12s are attainable on the stock turbo. Then you can upgrade from there.

The problem with adding power to the FWD MINIs is you max out the fun factor at around 300 WHP. As an owner of a 550+ WHP FWD car from many years ago, it's pointless.",MINI
It's beautiful! My favorite color.,MINI
Nah meth heads would still steal it,MINI
"Okay, That‚Äôs an R60.

Coming from a fellow late R gen owner (R56s) with the same engine. 

I would do some research. That era of mini is what gave them mini a reputation of being unreliable. Preventative maintenance will be your best friend, but with a used car it‚Äôs hard to know what the previous owner did or didn‚Äôt do. 

In all honesty, If you are really set on getting a countryman, I would save  up a bit extra so you have money to do the inevitable repairs. Or use that extra you saved up try to get an F60 (2017 or later) and avoid the headaches.",MINI
Probably a stupid question but what is the leash on the front for?,MINI
"I posted my 2019 JCW on r/CarTalkUK and got a few comments from people trying to be funny saying the timing chain will go and it‚Äôll be a money pit and minis are the worst cars they ever worked on. A few of them left a link to various mechanic YouTubers saying minis are the worst cars (despite the title stating 2007-2010) 

It‚Äôs like me posting a brand new g80 m3 and some dumbass says that the e9x m3s were unreliable and a fortune to maintain so the g80 will be the same",MINI
I think it‚Äôs a perfect car for at least 2 kids maybe even 3. The trunk is huge and my back seats extended for extra leg room! Also the front is just perfect. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm lugging around a big truck!,MINI
When I coded the taillights on my 16 I 100% needed the tutorial for BimmerCode. All the options were in German.,MINI
"You might just get lucky if it‚Äôs a 2017. Starting that year a dealership can enable CarPlay in some cars aftersale but not all.

If that particular car isn‚Äôt capable then it would take some work but it is possible with the existing head unit. Check out this excellent guide:

https://www.bimmer-tech.net/blog/item/139-how-to-retrofit-carplay-in-mini-cooper

But keep in mind without a touchscreen you‚Äôd be using the controller which might not be ideal. Also CarPlay wouldn‚Äôt be as legible with the smaller screen.

So yes there‚Äôs some possibility, maybe at the dealership or maybe outside but it will cost either way. There are also some excellent phone mounts for the Countryman that give a very OEM look which may be the best option.",MINI
"Realistically you've got 100miles range at motorway speed at 65/70mph. In cold weather less. 
Our Oct 2020 SE has done 31k miles in 3 and a half years and the battery seems to be holding out fine. 
It's rubbish for longer trips due to the low rate of DC charging<50kw but with charging at home it's great. 
More fun than the Model 3 to drive",MINI
"As someone also with an R56 I disagree. I love it but these cars live for random failures, and anyone who can't deal with that should buy something else. 

Spit out a single coil of a spring on Tuesday, Wednesday develop a random misfire because a coil is on the way out, Thursday will throw a MAF code because the intake decided to split in half. Friday boost starts oscillating for no apparent reason.

A lot of these cars have maintenance neglected, but a lot of the issues come down to how cheaply built the R56 are. Engine seems great, but all the timing components and engine accessories really let it down. Chassis drives nice but the mounts and especially dampers are the cheapest junk they could find. Basically all the exterior trim pieces are known to randomly depart the car at speed, the windshield cowl access hatches open a maximum of 10 times before they snap off. I could go on.

Like I said, I love this car. I just want to be realistic about how needy they are.",MINI
Hey OP let me know if you figure out what the jerking issue is. I have a 2011 mini cooper s and it has the same issue. I changed the lower engine mount thinking it was that but it still jerks a little harshly when in lower gears. It does it when I lightly press on the accelerator so I have to ease my foot down and press lightly to accelerate.,MINI
"My passenger already settled with the driver's insurance over injuries.  I don't think she understood that 4 days post-accident was too early to really know if you're totally ok.  I'm not looking for a payday, I just want to make sure that nothing serious comes from it in the next couple of weeks.",MINI
that's not how this works,MINI
Haha excellent!,MINI
"I have a countryman, and never fails my car disappears behind a truck or big SUV in a Parking lot",MINI
"Ugh. Yeah, that sounds pretty typical for a 2012 Countryman. Really don't think I'd ever recommend a Mini as a first-time car unless it's the newer gens. Even those are quite expensive when things go wrong.",MINI
"Thanks!

No HUD, but figured that one out. Not sure why I couldn't before. And mine does not have navigation.",MINI
Watch a YouTube tutorial on BimmerCode. I‚Äôm not near my car right now and can‚Äôt give you the right guidance. There should be quite a few videos to help you.,MINI
Beautiful comparison! Is that yet another mini in the reflection of the old one?,MINI
Maintenance and repair on Minis is expensive. Yes.,MINI
"Tire pressure. My rear left tire always drops 3-4 psi in a week (250-300 miles), no puncture, likely a rim issue.",MINI
Phoenix,MINI
Been here so many times but the gate is closed for cars. Curious how you got inside. Was it allowed back in the day?,MINI
Oh so that switch doesn‚Äôt even exist in your Mini? Makes sense then. I thought it would still be there but just not engage the auto-park mode if you don‚Äôt have the feature.,MINI
I love black wheels.,MINI
Red stripe: no. It's not a JCW,MINI
"Stop dreaming. If you‚Äôre willing to buy a water damaged car, you will end up spending more over time than you would on the same car in good condition up front. Every mini is a special edition in some way. It‚Äôs a meaningless title.",MINI
Well it seems that my opinion is out of the question.  Spray on removable gloss it is.  Not plastic dip but Rust-Oleum.   I'll post pictures of the results once I it's done.  Not my mini just in case I'm just working on it and keeping it running. Lol,MINI
At that point there would be no vehicle purchase. The whole point was to get an EV that I would actually like.,MINI
Between the gauges and toggles this is giving me serious Pagani vibes,MINI
When placing the 240V be aware the longer distance from your panel the more expensive it will be. Also make sure there will be slack in the power cable.,MINI
Oscar the mini cooper,MINI
"Sorry maybe i misread someones post, still learning the gen names. No i'm not trolling..

i don't think any of the minis in canada are diesel. Any particular years to try and avoid or get for the 3rd gen? Is the cooper vs cooper s more reliable? I believe it's the 1.5 L I3 vs 2L i4.",MINI
"Yes, my dealer offers loaners as long as it's available for any service that might take a few hours or more.

In this case I brought it in for an oil change, but they ended up doing my rear brake pads and replaced the engine mounts all under warranty.",MINI
"Not a bad price, again for an S all4, if you move forward be sure to inquire about the factory and maintenance warranties. If the car was not titled in the previous sale you should get the remainder of the 3yr or 36k maintenance warranty in addition to the factory warranty which is super worth it!",MINI
Good resale value because no one wanted it but they will later when it‚Äôs rare. But you should keep it for life. ;),MINI
"I‚Äôm still a novice with the coding stuff, where do I use/access bimmercode and what exactly am I telling the car with the code? Sorry for all these questions I‚Äôm just happy someone is answering my burning questions",MINI

"My R56 had the second cat, Resonator, and muffler removed, with a smaller aftermarket muffler added and the car sounds like utter shit. Not particularly loud on the outside but throbbing headache levels of loud inside. Even after adding another Resonator back, it is still far too loud inside. 

The stock muffler definitely pulls its weight, but I would remove the res/secondary cat one thing at a time (depending on your local emissions/inspection requirements)",MINI

"When it's alligator cracking like that it's going to be a royal pain in the ass to remove. It may be worth bringing it to a local vinyl shop and getting a quote for removal. It may not be worth the time and headache doing it yourself, plus possible damage to the roof if you haven't done this before.¬†


A low cost option to try is a vinyl/decal removal wheel. If you look that up on Amazon you will find them, they are yellow and the ones that look like a small tractor tire work well.¬†",MINI
I don't fault people for wanting a larger car to haul children for safety.,MINI
"Gotcha, I'll have to get it out and have a look. Only part that confuses me is how a short there would be giving me faults codes affecting MAF, camshaft position actuator, and emission system purge.",MINI
Absolutely not.,MINI
"Great MINI. Classic color combo, love the wheels.",MINI
"Commenting since my previous ride was a 2015 Fiesta ST (stage 3) before buying my Mini SE. Handling wise I feel they are close but the Fiesta feels like it outperforms and that it rotates easier. Perhaps this is a ‚Äúme‚Äù thing as I‚Äôve had a lot of seat time in my Fiesta on autocross and I was able to do the track experience out in Utah; pushing a Fiesta around the track at the old Miller Motorsports park at 100mph in the rain really teaches you a lot about out the handling and limits of the car and driver. That said, I think the Mini SE will be a lot better once I shed the garbage stock summer tires.

Overall, the Mini SE is far superior to the Fiesta. The Fiesta was an ecobox that was fun to drive, while the Mini is also fun but feels quality. The bonus is no more blend actuator door serenade!

40mi round trip commute for me, and charging at work is severely limited. Range anxiety for the first month or so, then it went away. The other commenters are spot on about the actual range, but in good weather and with smooth driving the range can be extended a good bit. I do have lvl2 charging at home but lvl1 would have been sufficient. I‚Äôm very happy to have the Mini, as it is a much better ride overall than the Fiesta. 

Oh, and the wireless charger for phones in the Mini is hot garbage (pun intended). It barely keeps my phone maintained but also makes my phone incredibly hot. If I need to charge now I use a cable.",MINI
"lol no offense but WTF, that is a huge difference and a huge surprise to most people. It also should affect the price, manuals tend to be cheaper. This doesn‚Äôt sound promising from Carvana",MINI
"A Mini mechanic told me as long as I use premium gas and change oil/filter every 5000 miles, check all fluids regularly, it should not have major problems.  True that is.

Premium gas keeps your fuel injector clean.  Most need frequent cleaning but not our Mini's if pampered with premium gas from major suppliers.",MINI
I appreciate the reply regardless!  Best of luck finding your Mini and enjoy the ride!!!,MINI

"This was my second Mini, my first one was a 2010 R56 that I loved, unfortunately, I had every engine issue that particular model was known for and it needed a rebuild at around 80k.  After that experience, I still decided to buy another Mini.  I love the way they drive so I'd absolutely get another Mini.  I'm undecided on whether I want another F57, but that has nothing to do with this accident. I loved my car, it fit my personality. I think the car did a very good job of protecting both of us.

If I can get my insurance settlement dealt with before it becomes harder to find a 2024 JCW, I'll probably try to get one.  I don't like what they've done with the interior of the 2025 models, particularly when it comes to the lack of physical buttons for basic things.

Looking like I maybe needing a new head gasket kit done including the valve stem gaskets. Hopefully the head isn't wrapped or cracked. Though it never got over 221f ever in its life. It's always stayed between 190 and 221. Coolant never drops, does always lose oil or burns it.

"Even if it‚Äôs freshwater, once that stuff, especially internally as far as wiring and whatnot goes, anything electronic is either already screwed or will be.

As someone who has both worked with cars, and fairly recently dealt with a freshwater flood personally, I can assure you that it‚Äôs very unlikely any of the electronics in that car aren‚Äôt impacted. Cars don‚Äôt get salvage titles for no reason.

I plan on buying a JCW F56 to replace my R56. Just happened to come across this model. It looks like it got flooded during the 2023 thunderstorms around the NY area. It only has a few thousand miles on it.

My thought was, insurance isn't willing to risk ongoing water damage costs so they probably salvage all water damage no matter how minimal. I was going to inspect it to see what I could gather. But I guess that's part of the problem right, I would basically have to take the car apart to inspect it throughly.

I get the sentiment here to never touch salvaged cars, but they're still sold at auction so there seems to be a market for it. The electronic connectors are all sealed with gaskets these days so isn't that enough to prevent ingress?",MINI

I've had MINIs for over a decade, so I'm not sure what took so damned long. :)

Annoyingly they changed the auto stop/start feature from being off permanently until you chose to reactivate it (or went into green mode), to needing to be switched off every time you start the car... but don't leave that feature on, especially not with a JCW. It is annoying AF and I wish it didn't exist.

They call it the BIS01, granted I‚Äôm only assuming based on photos from the dealer link however upon looking at the control buttons in the center console it appears to be that system. This unit is the 6.5-inch non-touch screen and unfortunately you can't add Nav or Carplay without a full retrofit of the NBT system which would costs upwards of $2600 in some cases depending on the unit. I found a guy on YT who does this professionally and can help you do it remotely yourself but tbh unless you‚Äôre IN LOVE with this one I would personally pass and locate one with at least the mini XL (larger screen) as those (from my research) have the capability to have CarPlay.

With the amount of cracking you have, I would plan on spending several hours to remove all of it.  Also, when using a plastic razor, pay attention to ensure you are not scratching the clear coat and remember that preasure is not your friend.  Let the adhesive remover do the work.

2. VANOS solenoids -- no interval.  Is it throwing codes?  Are you getting the half-power light?  No?  Then why change it?  Did someone tell you ""it's time to change it?""  There's no time to change it except when it fails.

"If you're on the stock block internals still, I would just stick to the stock clutch and flywheel. It will hold just fine at a safe 330 lb-ft or so.

If the car was AWD and you were launching it, I would get upgrading the clutch. But on FWD, you're so traction limited anyway, it makes sense to let the clutch be the failing point for too much torque, not the block.

Clutch slip and knowing you need to turn the torque down, versus a hole through your block.

If you need to upgrade, OS Giken is absolutely the way to go. I'm not sure they make anything for the 3rd gen yet though. I don't have a great suggestion otherwise as most aftermarket clutches and flywheels are crap.",MINI

"The cheap DIY solution assuming i can explain it: Take the headlight and tab out and clean all the epoxy off. Then tack the tab back to the headlight with crazy glue. Then get some paper clips and bend them roughly to the shape you'll need so they will melt into and ""stitch"" the broken piece to the body of the light. Leave some tangs out so you can grab them with pliers. Heat the paper clips over a stove and press them into the plastic. Make enough of these stitches so it's on solid. Then either melt the plastic around them with a heat gun or lay some epoxy over them to make it more firm. Then cut the excess tangs of the paper clips with wire cutters.",MINI

"To me the screen is a distraction--even when it's displaying traffic info/map. Handy? Sure but if I had wanted a screen-based car, I would have gone with a Tesla. A heads-up display is a safer way to get info and more useful while driving. I much prefer the dash navigation display. It's intuitive, although it could be positioned higher up in one's view to be safer. The main screen map is always oriented North--even when you are driving South. I'm used to it now, but for some, that adds some mental gymnastics to interpret. That's not something you want to have to do in traffic. Do I use it? All the time--zooming out to see what traffic is ahead. I'm just not in love with the coolness of the new screen. A cartoon character? Really? Sorry. My curmudgeon status switch must be stuck in the on position today. Enjoy the Mini!",MINI

"Surfboard doesn‚Äôt fit inside with the rear seats folded down?  If so, you just saved yourself a lot of cash, preserved the original finish/design of a relatively new vehicle and the security of the load 1000%. 

I ask because, roof racks may look cool but here‚Äôs what‚Äôs not cool about roof racks:

1. They‚Äôre expensive. If you‚Äôre not constantly using them like a worker with ladders and lumber or a professional bicyclist on a bicycle team with back up bikes in a bicycle race, it‚Äôs hard to justify the expense of purchasing and keeping them on there. 

2. They scratch the crap out of the finish. That roof looks to be excellent condition. Fashioning roof rack system on that will change that almost immediately.
 
3. Say goodbye to a quiet ride. Most rack systems are intended to be taken off when not is use. No one ever does, so you end up having purchased a very expensive wind noise maker. A relatively new car should be nice and quiet on the road. Say goodbye to that too with a roof rack.  That fact also adversely affects fuel efficiency. 

I live in a surf community and when I see old junky cars with racks on them, that makes sense. It‚Äôs a loud piece of junk with a degenerate paint finish anyway. 

When I see a new car with roof racks, I think someone made a mistake they‚Äôre stuck with.",MINI
"I saw someone mention aftermarket shifter cable bushings, but I haven't found them. 

I think the clips are supposed to stop the rubber bushing from sliding out of the shifter cable end. The rubber bits are moulded into the cable end, and disbond over time, eventually falling out. 

Before finding out about these clips, I had this happen to me for the cable that controls lateral movement, so I could only ""find"" 3rd and 4th gear.",MINI

"None of those engines come in a transverse configuration. There's no way you're fitting an inline 6 in this engine bay unless you severely modify the firewall and do a longitudinally mounted powertrain.

You can hypothetically make 800+ WHP from this 2.0 L 4 cyl with the right internals, E85, and a nicely sized turbo like an EFR 9174. I did it regularly on other platforms.

The transmission is the big limitation honestly. You'd need the 6MT and possibly some internal upgrades to it. But it may also survive just fine. Don't know until you try it haha.

Once I get a new engine swapped into our R56, I'm going to start to build a crazy setup for the F54. Would love to get it into the 9s which I think is totally doable if I can find somebody to build the transmission / valve body.",MINI

I‚Äôm a first time Mini owner but have had basically all my close friends own one and know some things here and there but I‚Äôm excited to learn the good, the bad, the ugly. One thing though, compared to other Mini‚Äôs I‚Äôve driven, this car is much smoother when driving.

I do have some question that I need some help with, I know I should know this but this is the F60 model correct? I went to some websites and they made it look like this wasn‚Äôt the F60.

and the other questions are more of advice I need because I want to do a few things:

1. Hood, rear stripes
2. rear view mirror
3. Black Headlight ring
4. The bottom part of the grill that‚Äôs currently sage green possibly red

Black and/or red are the colors that go well with sage green, my roof isn‚Äôt white and personally dont like it cause, unless it has some more additional accents, it sometimes looks like a chubby golf cart or peter griffin from family guy. Forgot the stripes but this is more or less the red/black, maybe yellow?accents I wanna apply. Does anyone have good site reccomendations where I can get them? And please, any resource you have online for accesories, share it! Thank you new fam.

one other thing‚Ä¶ the only aspect of the car that I couldn‚Äôt get on it which I wanted so much was the sound system as the models they had available went up like 3k+ from my budget, not worth it and stock audio system sounds, well, let‚Äôs just say not horrible. I‚Äôve changed sound systems before several times, but German cars re completely different monsters. Anybody have any good resources for that topic in the countryman? Thanks!!!

"Typically it's present on 2012+ N18s. Odd that yours is plugged. It's a fresh air vent to the block / crankcase which allows fresh air to enter the block when it's under PCV vacuum.

I always thought it allowed additional crankcase pressure to be evacuated from the block, but it in fact has a one way valve that prevents exactly that from happening, but allows the opposite. At least on the B46/48... I installed one of these on my N18 but I don't recall if I tried blowing through it when it was new to see how it worked.

Why in the f is this getting downvoted? This is 100% correct information. Perhaps they got rid of the ventilation hose again in 2014-2015 N18 but I know for a fact that 2010 (UK) / 2011 did not have it, and it got introduced in 2012 ish. So maybe present in 2012-2013 model year N18s only.

Also, what's pictured is a blanking plug. I know because I had one. The hose, when present, is crimped with a oetiker clamp to the plastic hose end / heater.

An enthusiast that's looking for a weekend car, enjoys working on cars, and can afford down time would probably be fine with any of the 3 generations but might be particularly into the 1st/2nd gens because of the lower upfront cost(and low maintenance cost if you DIY).

A high schooler looking for their first car probably can't DIY repairs and also likely doesn't have the budget for a 3rd gen.......meaning it's time for a 1st gen or to look at another manufacturer.

The two biggest things I see in this sub are 
1. Just buy a 3rd gen
2. Avoid the 2nd gen at all costs

"That's really crappy, I'm sorry that happened to you. It's not surprising that nobody wants to mess with it given what the problem likely is, but taking your money and doing nothing is still pretty inexcusable. 

To answer your question, it can. The throttle body cleaner isn't formulated to be nonconductive, so it can short at connectors or past them if it gets inside the insulation. I don't think that's where the short is though, and being a part of the same circuit doesn't mean they have the same fuse. So I've been looking what F4 is, since I'm not sure about that one and the labeling isn't helpful, and it looks like it's the DMTL. You can check the wiring of this pump, but the problem is it spans all the way to the rear, on the right side near the gas tank. Check the wiring for any damage, but know it can also be internal. It might also help to get a BMW scanner, since those can be more specific",MINI

"Ah, in that case, I‚Äôd just be looking for an Iconic trim Hardtop, it should come with pretty much every option unless it has a build date affected by the chip shortages, which were intermittent. But the window sticker will reflect any missing options and typically display a credit back to the original buyer. 

Insurance does indeed err on the side of caution because with newer cars especially, once water gets in, it‚Äôs usually beyond reasonable repair without essentially rebuilding the car. These then get sent to salvage auctions like Copart because no dealership will want the liability. A lot of folks who show up at these auctions are scrappers buying the cars to part out, along with a few people who may indeed want to take the entire thing apart to rebuild it, buy for certain parts, etc. But these aren‚Äôt hidden gems, they end up at these auctions for good reason. Because they‚Äôre usually fucked up, one way or another.

As for everything being sealed, eh, maybe from the elements like a bad rain storm. With a flood, a car is sitting in water, and that water has to go somewhere. It‚Äôll seep in to every crevice within that car, every gasket, seal, etc. And then basically fry the thing from the inside out. Is there a very minute chance you could get incredibly lucky and not have lasting damage. Perhaps, but do you really want to take that risk? Especially as, as you said, the only way to really know is to take the entire car apart.

Plus, even if the car functions fine, it‚Äôs basically worthless. So you literally will need to keep this car forever. As in, you‚Äôd be figuratively and probably literally burying yourself in it. Because if you ever decided you wanted to sell it, or if it did end up giving you issues, the salvage title is basically a ‚Äúrun far away from this‚Äù sign. As in, no dealership is going to want to touch it with a 5,000 foot pole, and most private buyers will see the title and have the same sentiment, or offer you pennies on the dollar for it. These cars already don‚Äôt hold amazing value with clean titles, so you‚Äôd essentially be marrying this thing for life unless you want to take a huge loss trying to re-sell it.",MINI

I love my Continental DWS06 Plus ExtremeContact, which are a non-runflat all-season that, IMO, you can‚Äôt beat for the price. Pilot Sports are probably the best performance tire you can get, but they come at a Michelin premium as well. Either would be a great option though.",MINI
"Quit worrying about what other people think. If you are happy with your car, that is all that matters.",MINI
"Depends on the generation. MINI has distinct model generations that more or less don‚Äôt share anything with one another. So, 

The first generation Countryman (and 2nd generation of MINI powertrain) was produced from 2011-16 and uses the 1.6 liter family of Prince engines designed in a cooperation between BMW and French automotive conglomerate PSA Peugeot Citroen. These engines tend to suffer from excessive consumption of oil which, if not preventatively addressed, will lead to well-documented failures of the timing chains and high-pressure fuel pumps. Countryman of this era also used a borrowed gearbox from the smaller and lighter Hardtop model, and as such, are a bit sluggish and can wear out clutches over time as well. 

The second generation of Countryman, and third generation MINI powertrain, was produced between 2017 and 2024, and uses the BMW B-series (B38 and B48) family of turbocharged engines. These have proven to be some of the most reliable motors BMW has ever produced, and have skyrocketed MINI to the top 3 in Consumer Reports as of 2023. Lesson learned from BMW: it pays dividends to actually focus on your quality, never trust French car manufacturers, and stop trying to cost-cut every little thing to save upfront.

2025+ Countryman is just coming out, but uses a similar engine family as the 2017-24, with the exception of differences in power and torque figures. A full electric model is also launching, which is new for the Countryman lineup.",MINI

Front? Camber is not adjustable but my attempt would be to shift the subframe to increase/decrease the camber accordingly. Not sure how tight the subframe alignment pins are, so you may be limited to what you can correct. Adjust front toe accordingly after the subframe shift.

Now, depending on the condition of the car (rusty bolts) I can imagine why the tech would say good enough because breaking a bolt can send them down a rabbit hole of cutting, grinding and welding that may be a waste of money.",MINI

"Hi, thanks for your advice. 
There are a few reasons the roofrack would be great. Mostly because a surfboard does not fit when we go to the beach. We live 1.5 hours from the beach so I never go alone and therefore space in the car is taken by people. Backseats could sometimes go flat, but I'm not a pro surfer who uses a shortboard, so the pasanger seat should go down to at least have a chance to fit a surfboard. Which is always occupied for beach trips. 

The car is from our company so scratches and stuff are deemed user marks. Though i would like a descent roofrack that doesn't damage the surface as much as possible, of course. Though im not sure it exists, and therefore, this post .

The fuel is included in the monthly fee to use the car privately. (It is quite common in the Netherlands) Which makes it also less of an issue.

Regarding the noise. We would just accept it. Want to go to the beach? That's the compromise.

If you have advice on  the roofracks, I would still love to know!",MINI

"It was a 2016 BMW 5 Series.  I can't remember exactly which model in the series.  I was cruising around 63mph and I was 2 - 3 seconds behind the car in front of me.  I'd started on the brakes at the same time my FCW had gone off, I had that set to alert early.  My F57 is a 2022 JCW, so I had the bigger brakes on it.  The impact was right around a second after I'd stopped, I'm not certain of what speed he was going.  I'm hoping to get some more information with the full police report within the next week.

My only real concern with the way it handled the collision is if I'd had any rear passengers.  Both the seatbacks did collapse backward and the passenger seat twisted due to the angle of the hit.  My head and left shoulder hit the door panel or the panel next to the rear left seat, I'm honestly not sure.  If you look at one of the photos you can see the distance left between the passenger seat and the rear headrest, it's not much.  We're not tall people, around 5'6"", and we weren't sitting that low or far back.  This may not be an issue with electric seats but the JCW models come with manual seats.

Go look at a lot of minis in your area even ones you don't wanna actually buy( from that same age) to get a Grip of what differences in usage exist. And take a look into the engine, ideally no scratches, clean smooth Steel covered with a Golden Brown to dark caramel colour. If its Black or Black underneath the Oil Film it's a characteristic for a to high oil change interval, Carbon build up and all. 
At the end it's Luck, was it driven in the High RPM all the time and enjoyed around corners? It will probably last less, then a higher mileage but long to work drive car, that was driven softly.
I personally do not have any experience with automatic transmission so take everything with a grain of salt.
And if the Price is to good to be true it often is.

Best Tip I can give you is, Buy a ""OBD"" Scanner that can explicitly scan for BMW/Mini Codes and read the codes from any car you're interested in, I got one from Amazon (200$) and returned it in the 30Day window after buying mine. It helped me tremendously to not get fucked over by the seller. The one I ended up with had 0 OBD Codes but 5 BMW codes I could read and fix. The one I got is the FoxwellNT510 Elite BMW Version. But maybe Bimmerlink and an supported adapter can do the same, no experience there tho.

Best would be to take the car before buying into an service center to get a professional view, but that's rarely possible. If you can tho look under it for Rust and so on.",MINI

"My quick research shows K-series Honda engine ‚Äúk-swapping‚Äù seems to be the most popular based on number of examples I‚Äôm seeing and resources. I also saw a few LS swapped Minis too. These are the modern cars just to be clear, not original Mini. I‚Äôll be honest, you don‚Äôt seem that serious about it as you probably already would‚Äôve known that, and you don‚Äôt seem to have any details laid out. Is this for the track or the streets? Will it be road legal according to your state laws? How much horsepower are you targeting? I saw a guy who did an LS swap [on YouTube](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VODLthQiX2o) who only came up with 260hp testing it on Speed Society. This seems like a very difficult project you have to have a passion for and be well set up to do. Perhaps if you come back with these details I would be more eager to follow your progress.

Edit: [This guy](https://youtu.be/N8gF7P8zkjk?feature=shared) seems like he is the most knowledgeable and less YouTuber-y about how to do an engine swap. This would be my choice for which gen and engine to do.",MINI

"The reason coolant/antifreeze is added is to modify the freezing/boiling point of the water and introduce anti-corrosion additives to the system. 

Water has a higher heat capacity than coolant, which means water is much more efficient at absorbing and transferring heat from the engine. You can run straight distilled water and the cooling system will work fine but if you live somewhere where it freezes then that is definitely not a good idea. 

The coolant also does increase the boiling temp of water but one thing to keep in mind is that the cooling system on a car is a sealed and pressurized system, which means your boiling temp will be much higher than normal regardless of coolant. 

The recommended 50/50 ratio is pretty general and works well for the most cases most of the time, but you can totally deviate from that.",MINI

">The VANOS is still on the original ones, and it will throw it in to limp mode occasionally, especially when it‚Äôs driven on cheaper fuel. It should be something I can change myself.

Are there codes stored for VANOS solenoid?  Mine needed one very early on, at around 50,000 miles.  It set codes.  Limp-home was nearly constant until fixed.

I've got 135,000 miles on mine, and the one major thing was valve stem seals at 100,000 miles.   Bunch of minor stuff -- melted corner marker sockets.  Corroded tail light metal contacts causing ""bulb-out"" errors.  One of the fuel senders went wonky at 90,000.  Rear wiper motor at 125,000.  Rain sensor at 130,xxx.  Antenna base gasket at 130,xxx.  All the glue has gone -- all the wheel centers lost their stickers, and I assume they used the same glue in the roller shades because both of mine are shot.  That's my next repair, the shades.  I've taken care of everything else, a mix of my doing it or the dealer doing it.

Valve cover was done at 128,000 only I cannot trust the shop that did it, to say that they did what they say they did.  I need a way (short of taking the cover off) to confirm that a new cover was put on.  This was the **one** job I gave to an independant and I can't trust 'em.  My car went in drinking 1 qt / 2000 miles, and it's still drinking that much.. even tho the PCV is **in** the valve cover.

As for the chain, be vigilant but don't be (too) paranoid.  If it's not rattling in cold starts it's fine.  Keep the oil up, and have it changed on-schedule and it shoudl be fine.  Chains are lubricated by engine oil, and being 1qt low is enough to stress it out.

R56 drinks oil.  Mine's been drinking 1 qt / 2000 miles since.. I dunno.  90,000?   Earlier?   I just check it every sunday and top off when it's 1/2 qt low.

EDIT:  One final thought.  It amazes me how many people in this sub I se with ""milkshake"" on the oil filler cap -- a **clear** sign that the car's not being driven enough.  Any car needs to get up to operating temp, and then kept there for some time, to boil off all the condensation, which is a result of combustion.  If you start it, drive it for at least 20 minutes, maybe more in winter.  Short trips + infrequent oil changes = death.",MINI

"Well said. I‚Äôll admit, having been on the retail side and seen the ugly side of 2nd gens all day every day, it really makes me want to caution others. Plus having owned a 2012 at one point also. 

But, to your point, there are absolutely situations where each respective generation can make sense to a prospective buyer, and others can be a poor recommendation. For someone who wants to tinker with a weekend project, and doesn‚Äôt care about dependability, a Gen3 is sometimes actually not an amazing recommendation because they‚Äôre far more proprietary and very German underneath, so typically less DIY friendly. Such as when I had to get a specific BMW-sized socket to change my 2018‚Äôs spark plugs haha. Whereas the older gens tend to be a little more weekend mechanic-accessible. 

But, for someone looking at a car they want to depend on every day, then it‚Äôs often the opposite answer because the Gen3 is so much more reliable. And having owned a Gen1, 2, and now 3, I absolutely can attest that for a daily use vehicle, it‚Äôs by far the best product they‚Äôve ever made quality and reliability wise.

I've used a technique before at my job.   Using a heat gun to warm up the surface before painting it.   Then heat it up after painting it.  And so on.   The results were great and the part I had to paint gets hot fuel spills and even like that it lasted for 3 years now.  When it gets dirty I literally just spray degreaser and pressure wash it.   It looks like new again.   I'll try that on this.  See how it turns out.  I'm not good with painting and using that technique it helps because there is no rub off.,MINI

Earlier N18 and N14 cars seem to have the same port in the block, just with a blank or bolt installed.

There's also a heater element on both PCV hoses for some N18s, seems to be market-based. 

Delete plugs are available from various aftermarket companies like NM, M7. Probably easy to DIY with a resistor and a few pins.

The HPFP *works* if I completely power cycle the car, it comes out of limp-home mode and works fine for a long time.

I also recently replaced the plastic valve cover on the engine, because the seal around the engine was leaking oil onto the turbo, which lead to a lot of smoke and just burning through oil way faster than it should have.",MINI

"Carvana, carmax, DriveTime, such other widely advertised used car dealers I recommend to stay clear of because carvana in particular charges WAYYYY more for their used cars than anyone else because they sell you an ‚Äúexperience‚Äù as well as a car. I‚Äôve rarely found an actual good deal on a car on carvana, usually they are marked up $2,000 to $10,000 depending on what you‚Äôre looking at. Really depends on year and specs you want. It‚Äôs a great tool to find what you want as they typically have tons of info and a lot of pictures, but in my humble opinion and hard earned experience, especially if it‚Äôs fairly new, go to that brand‚Äôs dealer because if it‚Äôs CPO you can get an extended service warranty or if it‚Äôs a few years old, you can haggle a good bit since they typically want to get it gone to make room for something newer. Not saying that you can‚Äôt find a great deal anywhere else, it‚Äôs more about quality than price. I‚Äôd much rather pay a little more for a well maintained vehicle than dirt cheap for an abused one I‚Äôm going to immediately have to dump thousands into.

I spent months looking at local dealers, but I couldn't find what I wanted. But I was being kind of picky... I wanted a Countryman S, 2020 or newer, less than 50k miles, and for less than $30k. I also wanted gray, silver, or white... My color preference was less strict, but even without it, I couldn't find what I wanted.

Front shocks & brakes were noted as things that will to be swapped at its last service in October, and looking at them I can see they need to be done. The oil leak was noted on the last service and they said is likely the rocker cover gasket, but I will ask for a full inspection first to confirm where it‚Äôs coming from. Currently having to top up a litre or so every two weeks.  

I suppose I bought this with higher miles knowing it would have issues, I just didn‚Äôt expect a bunch to come at once. It also broke down in January because of an error with the ECU & the HPFP, and since then, I‚Äôve not been able to trust it the same.

"I have a 2012 Clubman.  Any O Reilly's Auto Parts will quickly read the code.  My half engine light is often on and the code comes back as P0087 which translates to:  Fuel rail pressure system too low.

( that could be the cause of jerking at slower speeds )

My only major repair started with an oil leak and that turned into a major deal about seals against a block ??  About $750 - no other problems.

I think it maybe head gasket but it doesn't has the milk shake of death, isn't solid white quick vanishing smoke, no sweet smell, isn't losing coolant, is losing oil, and only does it if I try to rev it past 2500 rpms on 2nd gear, if I keep it under 2500, it doesn't do it but struggles a little bit and has rough idle. It's not showing the codes and didn't go back into limp mode.

"TLDR: Try high end luxury dealers, Mazda dealerships, and BMW/Mini themselves for low miles cars. Private sale was a wasteland of salvage and high miles / undesirable model years.

I just bought a ‚Äò20 Mini Hardtop. I couldn‚Äôt believe how much Carvana was charging for these cars. They‚Äôre priced higher than the BMW dealer near me in one of the most expensive cities in the US! Did you see the prices after the hidden fees added? The BMW dealer is beating them on price while effortlessly getting low miles cars fresh off lease. There aren‚Äôt many good used cars out there right now. The last time I bought a car was 6 years ago and there were a decent amount of private sellers where I could pick from the best of them and save a few thousand off the dealer prices. That doesn‚Äôt seem the case anymore, and I wonder if people just stopped selling their own cars to settle for whatever Carvana gives them. 

What I ended up doing was buying from a high end car dealer who typically sells $100k+ used cars like Mercedes and Porsche. The Minis were by far the cheapest in his beautiful warehouse of luxury cars. He only buys the fully loaded Minis with the best options, and all low miles cars. He had 4 Minis and in my opinion they were like 4 out of 6 of the best for sale in all of California at the time I bought. I also noticed Mazda dealers around me also had a decent stock of used low miles Minis, perhaps there‚Äôs demographic overlap there that works for them if their customer can‚Äôt afford to buy new.

Edit: He also regularly sells to out of state customers. I can see why, judging from the car I got. If you want I‚Äôll give you his name.",MINI

1. Most special edition MINI‚Äôs aren‚Äôt that special. They do like 10,000 of them every year, and a lot of them are just trim packages, parts-bin specials, or leftover stuff the factory wants to get rid of. They really aren‚Äôt worth anymore than a standard one unless you find that one person that absolutely has to have that edition. But even then, the salvage title kills any potential resale you have here.

2. Water damage is the gremlin that you‚Äôll never get rid of. Once it creeps in, it doesn‚Äôt matter how little it looks to have been exposed. With all the electronics at play, it‚Äôll most certainly have underlying gremlins. 

If you‚Äôre buying this thing to part out cosmetic parts, I could see it. If you‚Äôre buying it to try and use every day, no offense but this is an incredibly terrible idea.",MINI

"As it comes and goes it definitely sounds like the DPF regeneration. Especially when idling or low RPM the engine run ‚Äûrougher‚Äú, because of extra injection steps to get the DPF very hot. Buts it‚Äôs also noticeable when accelerating. Maybe something is loose so during regeneration it starts to rattle? Because of the slight different injection, the exhaust tone can sound ‚Äûlouder‚Äú or at least sort of ‚Äûdeeper‚Äú. Additionally the turbo wastegate may open during regeneration and creates a clicking sound, which should be normal.

Oh well parking like a jerk is totally different! I mean I have a truck and I will totally park next to a mini and I'll park my mini between trucks but I've also never opened my car door into anyone! People really have no respect for others' belongings these days. If drives me wild.,MINI

">aren't the chain guides a part that could be updated

Guides were redesigned for 2010.  His is a 2012.  Mine's a 2013.  The later the better with R56s.

I mean, sure... if you have $ to blow, replace things that don't need replacing.. but it's better to have a solid reason *why* other than ""Well, I heard from a guy who had a cousin who had a girlfriend, who had a sister who had a 2007 and it chucked chains all the time""

Now, if that chain's going ""Clatter-clatter-rrrrrrubrubrclatter"" when starting from cold, change it.

Y'all do what you want.  What i""m tired of is hearing ""R56 is flaming hot garbage, get an F.""  That comes from people reading crap online, believing it, and parroting it.

You know on second thought, keep on thinking that.  It leaves R56 prices lower for those of us who prefer it to what came later.",MINI
"Im a real beginner with this stuff, however I‚Äôm pretty sure I have everything to do the coding.

"Oh ok, thank you. It's not my car, I'm looking to get back into another Mini and noticed this switch is missing in a lot of the ones I've seen.

So is it just a sensor that beeps when you get too close to something, and that switch turns it on/off?",MINI
"With the passenger side mirror that automatically adjusts down, and the reverse camera, I find it very easy to park my Mini. That and it is much shorter than most other cars out there.",MINI

Is there anything inside the throttle body that would short from having cleaner sprayed in it? If so I'll have to try to pull the throttle body out and take a look.,MINI
"I didn't know about that rule sorry üòÇüòÇ 
If you look closely at the side blinker they're the only thing that differs so technically they're unique",MINI
"I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre being downvoted. You‚Äôre right. 

In sport your throttle mapping is more aggressive (because these are throttle by wire), if you have adaptive dampers your suspension gets stiffer in sport. Your car will also pop and burble more in sport (more prevalent in pre-LCI cars from what I‚Äôve heard). 

In green your throttle is essentially 50%, dreadfully slow in acceleration. If you have adaptive dampers it‚Äôll loosen up, no burbles and pops. Will also show you on your dash miles saved in gas in that trip and will recommend shifts sooner if driving a manual. 

I drive a 15 F56S manual with intake, tune, exhaust and I drive in sport almost exclusively and never green mode and make 30mpg on my commute (40 miles of highway). On the weekend with more in town driving I still average ~25-26mpg.",MINI

"So even surpassing boiling point, theoretically it should be fine? Only thing is, mini recommends a 1:1 ratio which increase boiling temp to 225F/107c. So a normal ratio of antifreeze/coolant should practically almost never experience over boiling it seems.  

Also what‚Äôs the reason for engineering the car to run so hot. I read it helps with mpg but not sure if that was bs",MINI
Yes that seems to be the route we are taking. But Rust-Oleum instead of plastidip.,MINI
"2014 is the first year of the 3rd gen, so both will have the 1.5 liter (litre lol) B38. The B48 is the 2.0. 

The B series motors as far as I‚Äôve read about are much better with fluid leaks than the previous bmw motors, but it‚Äôs still good to keep an eye on them regularly",MINI
"okay, I appreciate the discussion. I'll heed your advice and not mess with it. Even if I get lucky, you're right, it not having a clean title will probably make me regret the decision down the line.

I checked the VIN and looks like it's been flipped at auction a few times and at one point had a biohazard sticker?? lol.

Thanks for the help!",MINI
"Then it's most likely a thermostat if the coolant is hitting the top of the transmission. Other than that, it can be the oil filter housing gasket, that will also leak toward the right side front of the engine.",MINI
"I owned one for a while.  It was quick but it was more muscle car than go kart.  It cruised at 90 on the highway without any drama.  It was great for daily driver duties.  It was loud when you wanted it but settled down to something quiet and refined.

On back roads, I didn't enjoy the weight or the slow throttle response.  It rolled over onto the front tire side walls on turns which was scary due to no spare.  There was some computing going on between the gas pedal and throttle body and it felt like there was a delay.

The biggest issue was the transmission tuning in parking lots with a slight grade.  It wouldn't creep forward.  You would give it some gas, nothing would happen due to the throttle delay, then it would suddenly be going 10mph.  The brakes were over boosted so when I went to press them, the car would stop, trigger stop/start, and roll back a few feet.

I liked mine but it wasn't worth $750 a month for me.  I like it better at a cheaper price.  It should be a nice fun upgrade over the outback.  $32k sounds a little high to me.",MINI
"Don't do a cat delete. That secondary cat is largely keeping your emissions in balance as the system ages. Front cat in the DP is likely more depleted than the rear.

Doing so is harmful for your health, and it will create a raspier unpleasant exhaust tone.

Just a resonator delete sounds really good on the R5x platform. A full catback opens up a world full of drone on the highway. The stock muffler and piping are very specifically designed to eliminate that drone. You won't get it with a resonator delete alone, but doing the whole catback will.",MINI

"2008s or should I say the 2nd gen‚Äôs in particular can be very temperamental, to say the least. I had a 2011 LCI JCW and was throwing money into it after 80k miles as items overtime would just break or crack from terrible design and shitty plastics. I would say the 2008-2010s should be avoided. Even some 11s. Try and locate something closer to 2012 and up with a healthy service history. Or, If you can, find a 3rd Gen that works in your price range as the engine is more reliable in that generation. Good luck with your search!!! Happy Motoring!",MINI
