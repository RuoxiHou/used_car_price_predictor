How reliable are the recent DS cars? ( DS7-DS3),DSAutomobiles
"I have a 2016 DS3 and it hasn’t let me down in the 1 and 3/4 years that I have owned it, the only thing that has gone wrong is an o2 sensor but that was an easy fix! Other than that I’m not aware of any other reliability issues :)",DSAutomobiles
"Have you enabled CarPlay on your phone and connected it to your car via USB? I’ve found very few modern cars have wireless car play unfortunately, my 2016 ds3 only does wired CarPlay :)",DSAutomobiles
"I bought a DS7 2019 and for some reason car play is grayed out even when I am connected via bluetooth, siri is on I mean everything is enabled but still cant connect to car play",DSAutomobiles
I like the styling of this car,DSAutomobiles
