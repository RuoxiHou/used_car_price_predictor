"My car came without a solenoid (154bhp).

It does start with the original ECM, and the new ECM seems to have VSS enabled yes. But after furter research I wont do any furter work to get the new ECM to work, as BSR seems to have a bad reputation when it comes to Saabs.",saab
">. My E46 BMW was the worst car I've ever owned by a mile. The Saab is not only built more solid, but it actually works every day like a real car! BMWs since the 90s have been designed to fail out of warranty, and most manufacturers have since adopted this same design philosophy. I understand the NG 9³ is a bit of a dud in the lineup when it comes to reliability and a lot of people seem to make the mistake of judging the entire brand's reputation based on the NG 9³ (which is arguably the worst Saab ever made)

My e46 is far better than most of the Saabs I have owned,  I have broken more than 15 saabs but have not broken my 330ci yet.  

I would break transmissions on my older v4 saabs and my c900 saabs all the time, I even shattered a flywheel on a 9000 once",saab

"The big steel ones have been on every turbo I have ever owned, which is like 50 of them. None have been automatics.",saab
"It's a manual with tons of miles and cosmetic issues. all three hurt your value. 

I say the bottom price for a running driving car with A/C is $2000, so I think you can probably get that much for it. list it for $3k, and hope somebody who really wants to drive a manual picks it up. List it on saab specific places like [saabnet.com](https://saabnet.com). 

Kbb says $1500-2500 private party. so right in that range. LOL, trade in is $150. sounds about right.",saab
"That is where my thinking is with it right now. Since it’s had issues before regenerating, it’s probably a lot worse off now.",saab
"I had a repeat left axle seal leak after replacing the axle.  Figuring my luck had run out with the used seal, i replaced it and that one leaked.  Then i replaced it again and still i leaked.  It turned out to be the axle.  Although the sealing surface looked fine and measured exactly the same as the old axle, replacing the axle again fixed the leak.",saab
"Have a search on this sub, as I'm pretty sure it's come up before. I think it's either the motor or the band slipping. The latter would be a cheap fix. Either way, something you can do yourself if you're handy with tools.",saab
"What check engine codes?

What brand, model, gap spark plugs?  What brand of coil pack?  Usually ""jerking"" as you call it is spark misfire.  I tune these cars and ALWAYS recommend NGK, 6282 plugs gapped tight at 0.7-0.8 mm.  Not inches.  mm.  [esaabparts.com](https://esaabparts.com) sells them for $2.38 each.  And make sure you have the correct oem Saab coil packs.  Not aftermarket.  Dont' lie, if you put anything aftermarket in they will misfire.",saab
I had to change both on mine!,saab
Great write. Anything about  Saab 9-3??,saab
I want mine to end up looking like this 🔥,saab
"Are you referring to the blinkers behind the front wheels? (Typically referred to as side markers). I assume not since they're already clear. If you're talking about the orange reflectors on the front bumper within the black trim, I would probably just take them out, paint them black, and put them back in. Technically not allowed but I don't think anyone would realize they're missing if they didn't know what it looked like before.",saab
"Makes sense , however my sunroof has no problems otherwise, it can open and close with out any worries minus the sun cover which sometimes gets stuck. Was hoping to avoid having to take the whole thing out",saab
"I have 300,000 km on my 9-3 2.0T. I've identified the problem. It definitely goes away ( full compression) once the car is warmed up. I've checked the compression cold and hot. And it's only at half when cold. 
I'm planning on doing the valve job someday, but have never had any cold start fails (just rough when cold).  I live in the warmer climate of vancouver, So not so annoying.
 I have read that the valve job is a pretty simple fix, something you can handle on your own if your mechanically inclined. The WIS will walk you through it.",saab
Wow! Nice! I have a couple from an ‘85 SPG and they are very technical yes,saab
"This thing has been a nightmare for real, turbo blew a week after I bought it. In november it almost threw the timing chain, I've had to retourqe the entire top and change about half the gaskets, change subframe bushings, 2 axels, airbag has been changed and it's chewed up 2 serpentine belts. All this within 2 years of owning it.",saab
"I love my 9-5 but it never really was reliable. There’s always a little something. And mines only done 148k miles. I’ve had It for six years and it broke down twice, once due to a faulty DICE (though it was my own fault for buying a cheap one) and once when I lent it to my parents and they went on vacation with it and on the last day the fuel pump died.",saab

"If you are looking for the Saab standard luxury wise I would still suggest a Saab 9-5 Arc or up (Aero Preferred) with a Stick, about 100K or under, that is if you do not need 4WD, but a good set of tires solves any snow problem. It has a 6 second 0-60 and is a highway monster.",saab
"Vacuum leaks almost definitely, how high does it idle in park? I’d be careful driving it like that for your transmissions sake. if you’ve gotta drive it maybe throw it in neutral before braking or when stopped, you’ll chew up 1st gear pretty bad stopped/stopping in drive if it’s idling super high.",saab
"I think this is overly generalized a bit too far. If you compare a top spec Saab 9-3 Aero XWD from 2009 to a Mercedes C63 from the same year, the amount of electronics and things to go wrong in them isn't that far off one way or the other. But as far as I can tell the majority of Saabs you still see around were closer to base level trim and options. Some of this is just that not as many top trim 9-3s were made as the C63 afaik. 

The comparison really differs to by the year you choose to compare, and if you're comparing against Mercedes, BMW, or another manufacturer. For example BMW in 2008 was making _garbage_ in terms of reliability. The closest competitor to a Turbo X in 2008 would've been either the M3 or 335i from BMW, and with those two cars you have some of the worst BMW electronics ever and engines/turbos known for blowing up at random. But if you compare with model year 2000 to BMW, it looks a lot more comparable",saab
How can I tell which one I need? Want to make sure I order the correct one. Also I don’t have a lot of money to spend on the car and it sounds like a lot of work that has te be done to solve this issue. You would recommend the oil change first?,saab
"I’ve been there 😔. 

I was struggling to justify to keep my 9-5 aero running at the maintenance it took, and then it decided to help me by breaking down with a clutch repair i couldn’t afford on top of the other things. 

I hope you can sell it to someone here!",saab

"We have a Volvo V50 with a Peugeot 1.6 turbo diesel. Not the lost powerful but I really like it.

It’s the top trim level of this model. A performance version! (Wish mine was one haha),saab
"You're using tech2win I presume? I think it's a bug/design flaw in tech2win. I have had the same experience. FWIW, tech2win also has a bug with CAN on 9440. It sort of feels like Saab+tech2win was never fully/properly implemented. I'm using a recent clone MDI FWIW. I have not tried it on my '08 9-5 but it doesn't work on any other ""OG"" Saabs I have tried. (It does work on my '99 Suburban, though...)",saab
No rust sounds like its primary selling point.  These days you can probably get $1500-$2000.  But it’s got enough issues that people are going to do their best to haggle you down.,saab
"Had you showed me the rims off the car I would say don't do it.   
I would have been wrong. Those look great on there!",saab
The most important thing when buying any car Saabs included is getting as much of a detailed service history as you can. And then going into it with the correct mentality of your buying a used car and it likely needs a stage 0 service. Whatever that entails.,saab
"Mhm, I think reliability is the best feature though. Diesel engines go and go compared to their petrol counterparts. You can run them hot with minimal coolant and they'll still cool themselves via oil, because the explosion is due to compaction not ignition. Sure they have Glow plugs but compared to spark plugs they rarely go bad. 

It's hard to kill a diesel engine. My main complaint with it is the diesel itself. It's probably the worst, most dirty fuel to consume, more expensive than petrol nowadays and since recent advances in gas engines, they are pretty much the same in fuel savings. By comparison petrol burns more cleanly and completely since both have EGR valves and other ways to filter exhaust now.

Still miss it though.",saab
"I'm not trying to convince anybody, I just needed to rant a bit. I've decided to get rid of it since it feels unnecessary to keep such a big and thirsty car, it takes up about 40% of my monthy salary with insurance and gas. 

If I buy a smaller car I can get that down to about 20% even with a loan, and that means I can start saving for a house with a garage and even for a project in the future 🤷",saab
"Check the the wiring harness. It's mounted on the right side of the chassis under the battery box there are 2 Grey connectors, they tend to have loose pins causing those codes. Clean and reconnect them.

Then try this:

recalibrate the throttle sensor.

1) car in off position no key in
2) press accelerator pedal to the floor 100%
3) depress clutch if manual
4) Start the car as normal leaving pedal at 100%
5) After check is complete on SID release pedal 0%

Lastly, if not fixed pull the TB and shake it. If it sounds like there is plastic rattling inside it is done for.

If none of that works come back and I'll do some more digging.
I've retired from Saab and moved on. All of my knowledge is here on this forum. Enjoy your Saabs!",saab

Took the throttle body off and didn't realize there was a seal on it... Ordered new one and will put that on when it gets here. Intake manifold looked pretty dirty but the throttle body seemed pretty okay. Is it safe to drive it without the seal on the throttle body?,saab
"Nice! Good buy. I bought that diesel with 7months inspection/valid MOT 900€.
My second daily driver 2005 ng9-3 B207E, bought 1.5years ago 300€ and had 5months MOT/inspection time. I spend around 150€ new brakes and coils and got new 1 year mot/inspection driving time. Now it due to got mot/inspection to do, but i will probably sell it as parts/scrap because rear frame and axle beam have been rusted through and will fail mot inspection.

That diesel have been most expensive saab that i have bought. I have been bought them on 225-700€ with mot still valid.",saab

"I feel for you!!
I was in a similar situation when I lost my license a few years ago. 

Every day up to doomsday, all I could think about was what I would do with my pride and joy! I was determined not to get rid of it, not to sell it. It would’ve been easier, but I was determined to keep it. 

I ate, slept and dreamt about what I could do. Then, out of the blue, on the last day I could legally drive, an old friend outside of London heard about my predicament and offered me a place to store it. 

So, my last day of driving was up to my friend's farm, where she is now living the country life in the barn. She’s living her best life, even more than me🤣

What I’m saying is it's obvious how much you love your car, and people around you know this! Ask around for a home for her; have selling be your last resort!

Manifest the hell out of it!! I'm pretty certain that what I did🤔

Good luck. DON’T SELL..!!",saab
"a trick that i learnt since i didnt have a leaf blower for the roof is don't scoop all the snow off the roof by hand.

tsg-tsg is 100% correct.  Prove it to yourself.  Raise car.  Spin wheel.  Press brakes a few times.  See how different the brake drag is on the wheel.  You can also crack the bleeder and see if the pressure relieves itself and the wheel spins freely.,saab

The free and easy fix is to use your tripmeter as your gas gauge, I do this on my beater 9-3s. Fill the tank to the top and reset the tripmeter, refill before 300 miles.",saab

"9-3's can have micro leaks possibly anywhere. Worth a check to disassemble small turbo hoses and check the air intake hose to maf sensor for small cracks, maf sensors are prone for malfunctions, clean it also. Do88 sells high quality replacements for hoses if you're interested in replacing them. Worth the trouble to check the fuel pressure regulator and injectors for carbon deposits too if they are still oem. Could be a weak ignition coil too which is a known issue for 9-3's, you can test all coils for spark with a tester.",saab

"Thanks for this great answer ! I'll look for that manual pump, however I don't think there is one by default in this car. I've seen some people installing one on their own because the car lacked one. I'll check in the engine bay anyway, just in case. 

Yeah, there could be an air intake somewhere, that would prevent the diesel from reaching its destination. I'll check that out. I also plan on bypassing the tank, by connecting the injection pump to a small bottle of diesel above the engine. 

You're talking about a valve and gasket, which ones are you talking about? I'm really uneducated when it comes to this type of engines and fuel systems. Could it be the injection pump valve? Gasket ? And if yes, which one more precisely ? Like, at the diesel input banjo bolt? 

Understood chief, yes it's the pump + module. Okay for the tech 2, I have a Saab garage not too far away, I'll call them for the tech2 part since I don't own one.",saab

Cabrios and Viggens were all made in the Uusikaupunki plant but afaik no regular 3 or 5 doors were made until the 03 switchover modelyear.

"I’ll be the voice of dissent here and say I love a satin black grille on a red Saab…because I have one! My NG900 in ruby red has an OG9-3 grille that I’ve plasti-dipped black with the exception of the center wing (the bar that includes the SAAB text). The plasti-dip peels easily from the chrome if you ever want to go back but it’s also super long-lasting, I blacked mine out over ten years ago.

"Drive it for awhile and get accustomed to it stock. Give it six months. Then decide what it actually needs improved. I know it’s tempting to go ham right away, but you’ll get better bang for the buck and results once you know what annoys you in daily use. Lowering suspension aftermarket messes with all sorts of suspension geometry components that affect not only ride but also handling at the limit. This is increased the more you remove. In general your ride quality will suffer by lowering. If you wanted to upgrade the suspension to make it more aggressive without messing with those things as much you could bring it up to Viggen specs.",saab

Until you read the codes and report back with them we can not help you at all.  Parts stores read them for free in USA.  eBay and Walmart sell the Autel AL319 for around $30.  It's a great investment in any car.  I use them when I don't have my Tech2 with me.,saab
non-running ‘05 9-7x that’s in the process of getting an L92/6L80 drivetrain and a ‘08 93 Aero. Looking to add a b284 9000 to the lineup in the future but the FB marketplace LS drivetrain has other plans for my hard earned cash,saab
"I'm afraid I have no idea either. On the 1st gen 9000s I had LOTS of problems with window regulators. I probably owned a dozen of these cars and I think I replaced at least one regulator on every one of them. But, I replaced them, never repaired them. The few times I tried the fixes never lasted so I gave up. That's why I am so cautious with my '95. I don't know where I would get a replacement in 2024.",saab

Did you actually clone the ECU?,saab
"Nice! DPF is probably ""naturally emptied by driven kilometers and exhaust gases"" (sounds empty and bad smell on cold) but egr is visually still installed but i dont know if it have been disabled on tune software. Both can be still active, dont know sure.

I was thinking that oilpump seal was only problem on dual turbo (ttid) engines. Here in finland i have only have been seen that problem on those. Probably it have been already done to this with that kind of mileage. 
I think i have few glow plugs broken. Sounds like engine will granade and throw a conrod, but half minute idling it will sound good again.

And also gearbox is questionable. Especially cold reverse to drive is slow and need to press gas hard to get it moving. And also gearshifting between gears are slow and jerky and kickdown responsive poor, will slow think what gear take and bounce on them. But not slipping or banging any gear. Last gearbox oilchange was done at 320 000km.",saab

"This is my list, please PM or comment with things I left off (there will be a lot at first). I am excluding things like ""Check for puddles of oil under car"" or ""Make sure the lights work"". I'm doing it car by car starting from the C900, and ending with the second generation 9-3/9-5 as time permits. Before/After those years I don't have enough experience. Most people won't be able to check all of these things. I will probably organize this in ""Things to check on all Saabs"" and ""Specific to Car"" sections.

**Classic 900**

1. Rust
 1. Front/Rear spring seat
 2. Front/Rear shock seat
 3. Bottom of door panels
 4. Around the trunk lid
 5. Around windshield and rear window
 6. Around jack points
 7. Around tow hooks (rare)
 8. Under floor mats

2. Mechanical
 1. Check even wear on all brake disks
 2. Check that parking brake works and operates on both wheels
 3. Check that parking brake doesn't seize
 4. Check for smoke on startup or when revving
 5. Listen for excessive turbo noise when boosting
 6. Ensure there are no noises when turning at full lock
 7. Ensure there are no transmission noises in any gear at any rpm
 8. Ensure the oil and coolant are filled (if not, indicates lack of care for vehicle)
 9. Ensure no oil buildup between the engine and firewall (leaking front main seal)
 10. Check if R-134a conversion was done (if you want air conditioning)
 11. Check play in front wheels (should rotate no more than 15 degrees if the other wheel is stationary)
 12. Ensure no engine noises when revving from idle, or when idling
 13. Check for noise at idle that disappears when you press in the clutch (signals bad throw out bearing, not immediate problem, but it could mean the clutch is getting old)
 14. Check speedometer reading. If it wobbles or shakes excessively (most c900s shake a little) there is a chance that there is a transmission problem. Further, this can lead to a false odometer reading.
 15. Check weather stripping/seals (commonly fails or cracks on these old cars)
 16. Ensure that the struts in the trunk still support the hatch
 17. If coolant pipes feel squishy, they should be changed

3. Interior
 1. Dashboard tops commonly crack
 2. Blinker stalk doesn't always stay in place
 3. Check for cracks in seats
 4. Check seats still move
 5. Check sunroof operation

-----------------------------------------------

**OG/NG 9000**

1. Rust
 1. Rear spring seat
 2. Front/Rear shock seat
 3. Bottom of door panels
 4. Around the trunk lid
 5. Around windshield and rear window (IMPORTANT)
 6. Around jack points
 7. Around tow hooks (especially the rear)
 8. Under floor mats
 9. Under door rub (common)
 10. Under wheel arch trim
 11. Under wheel wells
 12. Around exhaust heat shields

2. Mechanical
 1. Check even wear on all brake disks
 2. Check that parking brake works and operates on both wheels
 3. Check that parking brake doesn't seize
 4. Check for smoke on startup or when revving
 5. Listen for excessive turbo noise when boosting
 6. Ensure there are no noises when turning at full lock
 7. Ensure there are no transmission noises in any gear at any rpm
 8. Ensure the oil and coolant are filled (if not, indicates lack of care for vehicle)
 9. Ensure no oil buildup around serpentine belt (leaking front main seal)
 10. Check upper torque arm (from firewall to engine) for cracks in the bushings (easy fix, though)
 11. Check play in front wheels (should rotate no more than 15 degrees if the other wheel is stationary)
 12. Ensure no engine noises when revving from idle, or when idling
 13. Check for noise at idle that disappears when you press in the clutch (signals bad throw out bearing, not immediate problem, but it could mean the clutch is getting old)
 14. Check for SRS light. If this is on, you need to find and fix the issue, then have a Tech 2 tool to turn it off. Or buy a new SRS computer
 15. Check for ABS light. An intermittent or permanent ABS light CAN lead to the ABS system engaging when it shouldn't (very dangerous)
 16. Ensure that the struts in the trunk and hood still support the hatch
 17. Check that the APC ""boost control valve"" (controls wastegate) is functional and doesn't leave the car at baseboost, or overboosting to fuel cutoff
 18. If coolant pipes feel squishy, they should be changed
 19. There is a small light at the base of the innermost light in the headlight housing, check that
 20. Check for cabin blower fan noise when turning.
 21. Check for oil buildup at the turbo-intake. Be alarmed if there are puddles, however a coating is fine and expected

3. Interior
 1. Dashboard tops commonly crack near the daylight sensor
 2. Make sure all ash trays are present
 3. Check for cracks in seats
 4. Check seats still move
 5. If jerky movement, most likely a bad memory control module
 6. Check for sunroof rattle
 7. Check for sunroof operation
 8. Check for dampness under passenger foot well, indicates failed heater core (IMPORTANT)

4. Exterior
 1. Clearcoat usually comes off the front and rear bumpers, this is not something to be alarmed at",saab

Saabs require maintenance and repairs.  Is that in your budget?,saab
"Indeed. While you can get away without *all* the tools there are a couple you need, or need to replicate, to put it back together. Also, several critical dimensions that if you get wrong the transmission won't last 100 miles.

"In mint condition a base model 2007 9-3 with moderate miles is $4k and it really sounds like you need more than $2k of work to make it mint, so you gotta keep that in mind. Used car prices are really coming down again.... They are not super inflated like they were two years ago.",saab

"I switch between my 2011 9-5 & 2006 9-3 as a daily driver. Love the 9-5, great car and plenty of parts minus the body panels. They had a very limited production run so spare body panels are from whatever wrecker you can find.  There more GM/opel than saab. A 2007-2011 9-3 might fit your needs better. Much cheaper to maintain and very reliable. The 9-5 is more of a luxury vehicle.

The car has been reliable as any other I’ve had with currently 212k miles. I do my own work so cost to upkeep might be high if you use a shop.",saab
If it's an electrical buzzing sound safe bet would probably be spark plugs or coil packs,saab
H&R have 35mm lowering springs. They are on sale now on Autodoc.,saab
"Subframe bushings, rear suspension (and bushings), turbo seals, as well as the PCV update are all common failure points. The clear coat failing should be a big bargaining chip, because making it look nice will be really expensive. Regardless it looks like a solid car overall, good luck!",saab

That comes from vacuum pump and its control valves.,saab
Yes and so I can add two fuses - one with constant power and one acc so the dashcam can have a parking mode without killing the battery,saab

I run those same rims on my lowered 9-3 and it looks so much better than stock.,saab
Right. I'm not nessasarily thinking a complete rebuild but possibly if it's reasonably easy to figure out where the problem is and I don't need to do a complete rebuild trying to fix it. I love my Saab and money is tight but I have time and some experience as a machinist so I'll think about it more before I do anything 👍👍,saab

"Fortunately, the broken part is part of the alternator bracket so it's realatively easy to replace.",saab
"Saab ""always"" did this.

In 1994 the 900 switched to the NG900 shape but a 1994 convertible is still a c900.

In 2003, the 9-3 switched to the NG9-3 shape, but a 2003 convertible is still an OG9-3.

Put another way, the first year of the NG900 convertible is 1995, and the first year of the NG9-3 convertible is 2004.

In short, the convertible models lagged a year behind.

Just tell people you have a 2002 9-3SE. It makes everything easier.

Also, Saab Convertibles were always made in Finland, at Valmet. Well, until GM moved production to Austria for the NG9-3.",saab
"The engine and trans will come out the top together with some finagling , but isn’t that hard to do. Remove the hood completely and hook the engine from the passenger side so that the whole unit rotates clockwise as it comes up.

"Strut bearings usually make a popping noise when you are stopped and turning the wheel.

Is that an internal gear hub on a fixie frame? Oh lord.,saab
"I owned a 2011 Saab 9-5 for 5-6 years until my wife totaled it :( (replaced it with a 2020 Volvo s90)

It's a great car. Feels absolutely premium even by today's standard. Fwiw while the market is scant and you can't really be choosy, I'd spring for the highest package one you find. You'll see that it holds up well even against entry level luxury vehicles a decade later. 

Car drives great but there are some quirks. A few electrical gremlins always seem to plague them. While rarely anything serious you'll see a light pop up and disappear with no real explanation. We had trouble with the front fog lights/running lamps going out. The rear blinkers would always blink like they were about to burn out, but they weren't and never did. Even a brand new blinker bulb would flash like it was gonna burn out but would run like that for four or five years. On the topic of lights, the rear trunk lid light would always go out. Not the mandatory legal brakelights or anything but the the light bar that runs the top of the trunk lid. It's a super common problem in the 2011-2012 9-3/9-4x/9-5. It's something to do with the ballasts or w/e. You can try repeatedly fixing it or just resign to the fact it won't ever really work. 

We had to get the right passenger seat butt warmers fixed once, but they worked after. 

Mechanically, the car was fantastic. Drove great, rode great. The best driving experience I've ever had. My Volvo drives great too but man the 9-5 was a dream. Sound system was awesome, and there was never a single mechanical issue with the car for us. Just make sure you pay attention to it and follow a somewhat regular maintenance schedule. If you have a Saab mechanic or a euro guy in your area all the better, but honestly any mechanic familiar with similarly specc'd 2010-2013 Buicks should also be able to handle it. They have a bunch of common parts. 

If you Google around, the biggest issue I'd always seen on the 2011 9-5 was the electrical issues. And I can definitely cosign that. But in the grand scheme of things they were minor annoyances more than actual problems. The silver lining to it I suppose was that due to the car market right now we got almost as much for the car from insurance in the total loss as we bought it for. Car really retained its value.",saab

"9-3s and 9-5s are definitely easier to work on.. If properly maintained they will last a million miles. 

Rust can be an issue, and some year models rot much faster than others.

They are still modern, electronic filled cars, so they require adequate knowledge and equipment.  Parts availability is good to excellent (at least here in Europe). Most mechanics will shy away from them as they lack the know how.",saab
"Sure. There are a bunch of videos on YouTube that show you how.


However, in another comment you said that the noise is still happening with the engine off and the car coasting in neutral? That makes me think it's something else. Do you have a wobble or drift or any other symptoms that you notice while the car is moving?",saab
Is it aero same as vector or vector is ok in the 2003 model?,saab
"the auto transmissions are not great, but since it is a non turbo it might be ok.  make sure you put new fluid in it

if it is 5 speed you are probably golden.

the alternator is a pain to replace unless you know the tricks.

the tranny is basically the oil pan of the engine so if you have to do work you must pull engine (yes I know some people have dropped just the tranny, but it is harder)

the A-Arms need to be inspected, they can break when you are backing up for some reason

parts are getting hard to find.   

I have not seen one in my local junk yard or craigslist for a long time.

"Several things:

If you are only draining 2.5 quarts from your engine you are running it DANGEROUSLY low. There should *never* be less than \~3.5 quarts of oil in there. Ever.

If you primarily drive short distances, you could be seeing moisture contamination floating on top of the oil. Normally this gets vaporized and sucked out by PCV, but if the oil never gets hot that moisture will accumulate.

It's possible you're just seeing aeration of the oil, which is more likely if the oil is over- or under- filled, and *probably* amplified by loss of viscosity due to overheating due to insufficient oil.

You need to take better care of your car... check the oil regularly, keep the oil properly filled, see if the condition continues.",saab
Yeah lol,saab
"Filter just screws off, you may need a filter wrench to get it off. Dont use the wrench to tighten it unless you have weak grip. In that case just be very gentle. Make sure you do a hot drain. The plug is 13 mm and the car takes 4 qts Assuming it's the same as my 99 9-5. Double check the manual if you can, otherwise start with 3 and use dipstick to check.

"Their scanner will work. These cars have an OBDII connection, which is what pretty much all cars and scanners are using these days. It will give you some generic codes that you google and research. It's your best starting point. I've fixed many a car with a basic OBDII scanner and the codes it gave me. 

You don't really need a techII scanner at this moment, which is essentially the same thing, but it does special things for the car in some instances that you need to fix particular issues. I don't for see you needing one, but we will know more when you get the codes.",saab

"Hi everyone-- I'm looking at a manual 2003 Saab 93 2t with 120K miles. Seems to be in good condition, going for $3,000. Worth going to take a look? I'm a little wary of buying an almost 20 year old car but everything else is out of my price range for the time being. Thoughts?",saab
YES,saab
"It’s both too late and too early for another EV start up.  The future outlook for startups like Canoo and Aptera seems increasingly grim, and even brands that already delivered consumer vehicles still have a long road ahead of them…Lucid, Fisker, even Polestar and Rivian.

EVs are still a fast growing segment, but apparently not faster than manufacturers anticipated, for various reasons.  Building a vehicle is one thing, ramping up to mass production is another, and convincing consumers they should buy a newly designed car from a brand that effectively already died once before is a big leap.  

What I mean by too early…aside from the still somewhat niche market share and the not-yet-standardized chemistry and infrastructure, I think only a large company like GM could survive a recall like the Chevy Bolt EV’s battery fire issue without going broke.  Even without a huge safety recall, if the nearest dealer is 500 miles away as is the case for other startup owners, then owning a NEVS pretty much has to be a second or third car.",saab

"What is the main goal here? Just looks? Better handling? Is it going to be a daily driver?

The recommendation to drive it stock for awhile is a good one.

I had a '99 9-3, with a T5Suite Stage 3 tune on the T25 turbo, Viggen intercooler, 3"" downpipe/race cat, and 2.5"" SaabSport/Remus exhaust. I used it as a daily but also competed in local autocross/track events.

For daily driver use, I'd recommend not going lower than 20mm unless you live somewhere with perfect roads. The Viggen springs of 10mm drop are great.

In terms of handling performance, this is the order I'd go in terms of bang for the buck.

\#1 - Tires/wheels, a great summer tire will do more for handling than any mod, bar none. A lightweight 17"" wheel with a good width/offset will really improve acceleration, braking, and lateral grip. I used Focal F05's.

\#2 - Rear Antiroll Bar/Sway Bar, I had a 1"" ARB on my car, greatly improved rotation/reduced understeer

\#3 - Dampers/Struts/Springs, I used adjustable Koni Sports with Koni 20mm lowering springs, great setup that can soften damping for daily use, but increase damping rates for sporty driving. Bilstein/Eibach is another popular combo. I had to roll my front fenders mildly to fit my 235/40/17 tires with the lowering to avoid rub.

My car was pretty dialed in, but still usable on shitty Vermont roads. I miss it some days.

On top of that if you aren't willing or able to do repairs yourself expect to be charged an arm an a leg from the 2 mechanics in your area that are certified.",saab
Many of us have done this going on years. All good.,saab
"
This first bit goes for all models. USE THE SPARK PLUGS RECOMMENDED BY SAAB. NGKs. They vary from model to model, but it's NGKs all the way. You will have issues using anything but, especially in the T5 and T7 models.  


9-3 sport sedans (03' and up) are generally pretty reliable. The first year 2003 models are said to have a ton of electrical problems but I've never owned one to confirm. 

Most common 9-3SS issues

AMP1 - audio amplifier under driver's seat gets wet when driver enters and exits the car. 15 years of rain and snow dropping on them burns these out. This amplifier powers the front door low end speakers and the 6x9s in the rear parcel shelf (if equipped). Lower trim models don't have front door speakers or low end parcel speakers until later in the lifecycle. 07 and up vehicles aren't susceptible to this as they switched over to the GM ""corporate"" head unit and associated electronics. 

Wiper motors - the wiper motors get weird and don't park the wipers correctly. They'll park at their furthest point of travel (vertically) as opposed to horizontally as they should. Replacement is the fix. Pretty easy, remove the arms and the cowling at the base of the windshield. 2 hours tops for a beginner with a set of basic tools.


Fuel level senders - A LOT of sport sedans and combis that I'm seeing for sale lately are showing empty on the fuel gauges due to bad sending units. The pumps are going strong, but the senders have failed. This is more of an annoyance than anything else, but it's compounded by the fact that many are triggering the low fuel light and it looks horrible and out of place against the lovely green gauges in the cluster. I do believe the tank needs dropped in these to replace as there isn't an access panel beneath the rear seats but I could be wrong. You could always cut a hole. 


Rust - these have all held up exceptionally well to the elements in Northeast and Midwestern states with the exception of two areas. Rear wheel wells (12 o'clock and 3/9 o'clock positions). As with any rust, address it now and save yourself the work later. The worst rust issues I'm noticing as a trend is front subframes. Happened to mine, as well. Catch it soon enough and you can just weld a patch, clean up any other surface rust, POR-15 it and run it another 10 years. If it's too far gone, eBay one from the west or south.  


ECUs (only applicable to the 2.0 turbo 4, not the 2.8) - Okay, this is a big one and why I'm really not interested in owning another. The ECU is mounted directly to the front of the engine under the plastic cover. As you might imagine, it gets pretty hot there. These are beginning to fail, frequently. I sold my last 9-3ss to a friend in 2019. 1000 miles later, he said it was running like shit and smoking a ton of white smoke that smelled like raw fuel and was throwing injector codes for each injector. I replaced and reprogrammed using t8 suite for him. Cost of the ECU at the time was 125. Priced them a couple of weeks ago and some sellers are asking over 500. That's way too much for an item you really can't even guarantee is good until it's been tech II or T8 Suited into your car, IMO. Perhaps if you were to buy a spare to keep on you that you had preprogrammed to your car, it'd be safer. This failure happened pretty suddenly and left the car nearly undrivable, but I'd be hesitant to limp it home more than a mile with all of that raw fuel being dumped into the catalytic converter. 


Everyone says the 2.8s eat ignition coils due to heat in the engine bay, but for the torque you get out of them, I don't mind doing coils every couple of years.

I can't think of any other negatives but the only serious one in my opinion is the ECU and even that can be repaired, for a price. 


The NG 900 and OG 9-3s?

At this point, anywhere rainy or snowy, rust. Just look everywhere underneath. My convertible had a small hole under the side skirt near the jacking point and it only had 96k on it. Some asshole must've driven it during winter and then parked it up for a couple of months without washing it. 
They rust around the different seams underneath.
Rust under battery tray, making a hole in the left wheel arch. 

Rust at the bottom of the rear wheel arch where the arch and ""trunk"" area panels meet. 

Again, deal with it when you see it. If not for yourself, then do it to keep these cars on the road, Please. 


The infamous sludge. This applies to the T7 9-3s (1999 to 02?) Black ignition cassette. 

First thing you do when going to look at one of these prepurchase - remove the plastic engine cover over the intake manifold and look at the tube the oil dipstick is in. There should be a hose coming from the back of it, going down the back of the engine and into the PCV catch can on the back of the block. If the hose is there, it has the PCV update. 

If you buy one that doesn't have the PCV update/recall done on it, regardless of mileage, update and drop the oil pan and check the pickup tube for blockage. A combination of a stupidly high oil change interval recommendation from SAAB as well as an inadequate PCV system turned the oil in a lot of them right back into carbon. There is a screen over the oil pickup inlet (meant to catch the occasional small piece of timing chain guard or whatever) that WILL get blocked with solidified oil if this isn't handled. 


At this point in their lifecycle, I would imagine most of the survivors have had this done. 


Speaking of ignition cassette:

Keep a spare in the trunk. Please buy OEM (will be marked on bottom with SEM) 

Cheap aftermarket versions will work, but unreliably and with misfires, which could cost you a catalytic converter, or will leave you stranded within a year if you're lucky enough to get it to last that long. 



OG 9-5s fall under the same advisories for sludge and ignition cassettes. Any 9-5 from 04 and up will have had the PCV update done from factory, so it won't be an issue. 

9-5s rust at the doglegs between rear doors and wheel wells. No biggie. Clean it up and paint. 


Front subframe bushings will probably need done. You'll know when you drive it. It's an easy job for a somewhat experienced DIYer. Couple hours with a lift, probably a day on jackstands. Replace with powerflex poly bushings. 

Rear end gets saggy springs because the car is heavy. Replace the pair. Why not go with Bilstein dampers while you're screwing around back there? Might as well do it to the front while you're doing bushings.....


Transmissions are Aisin. They are a supplier for a ton of manufacturers, even the Pinnacle of reliability....Toyota. Look up the maintenance schedule on them. Not terribly hard. 


C900s.....eh, if you're looking to buy one then you probably already know what to look for but I'll touch on a couple of big points. 

Transmissions - they're weak. All of them. Some more than others. Make sure all gears engage quietly and smoothly. If it pops out of reverse, then there are pieces of reverse floating around in the case. If it pops out of 4th or 5th, then you've got a lot more to worry about than pieces of gear. Listen for noise in 4th and 5th. Kinda sounds like a straight cut reverse gear but less pronounced. This is pinion noise. The bearings are worn. This means it WILL need torn down and at the very least, need the pinion bearings replaced. While it's out of the car and torn apart, you might as well have ALL bearings/worn gears/synchros/seals done. Expect to pay the few people in the US who are still willing to touch them anywhere from 1200 to 2k. Or play the ""how long will it take me to find a known good used transmission"" game like I did, only to be impatient after 6 months and decide on paying a pro to rebuild. These manual transmissions could be done by a DIYer and there's a good bit of information online (I have the actual factory service manuals for all years and sections of the 900 if anyone needs a scan of a wiring diagram or spec sheet, much more comprehensive than Bentley) but requires a TON of special tools. There are some workarounds, but I'm not comfortable messing with the pinion depth without the correct tool and they're pretty difficult to come by. 


Rust is definitely a thing on these depending on where you purchase it. I flew to the west coast and bought mine and drove it home because so many on the east coast seemed to be more of a rust bucket than I was willing to deal with. 

Driveshaft tunnels
Hatch door and hatch door hinges
Under wooden trunk floor
Under battery tray
Jack points and ""frame rails"" 
Rear shock mounts
Where doors curl under the body
The doors themselves
Fenders under trim
I'll edit as I think of more.

The seat heaters never work, the element breaks. It's a looooooong wire that runs back and forth all through the base and back of the seat. I counted 10 breaks in my seat base while I was reupholstering the fronts.

Most other mechanical things can be repaired or replaced and as long as the engine was even a little maintained, it'll be fine. Your weak point is the transmission and rust. With cars this old, there's no sense in discussing what could be broken because ANYTHING could be. That's not including any shoddy DIY electrical work or anything else you might run into when you have the interior completely gutted at 3am on a Saturday morning tracing wires........


I don't know anything about 9000s, yet.....
My wife wants a 9000 Aero, so eventually I'll come back and update with info I've gathered on the 9k. All I can say is that I've heard different enthusiasts say that the 9000 does everything the 900 does but better. In that case, I'm sold.",saab

"Only other thing I could think of is the drain under the wipers where the cabin fan filter is. The problem with these leaks is it can take a few hours for the water to trickle down into the car. You can check by really flooding out the area around the windshield with a hose and checking the car every hour or so for half an afternoon.

Both the windshield cowling (the plastic cover that the wiper motors pass through) and the cabin filter housing are sealed with 3M adhesive tape at the factories. It is high quality but eventually breaks down.

On my 2002 9-3 the water always ended up in my front passenger floor.",saab

"for the age this is a low mileage, just shy of 100k miles (160k km). I drive a 2003 9-3 and bought it just with over 300k km (\~190k miles) for 1700€ and have not needed to do anything drivetrain wise (I've driven 25k km last year). if i look at the market in the Netherlands right now this would be considered a somewhat reasonable price.

I wanted to put the trans of my 9-5 into the wagon but the wagon had the v6 & my 9-5 motor is trash.

My 9-5 has 107k miles, has had all maintenance done ahead of time and has been garaged.  I’d say the availability of body panels would be the main consideration if the car was in an accident.  I have not had any issues obtaining engine parts.  I have had more thumbs up and positive comments on my 9-5 than any car I have ever owned.

"To be clear, the turbo the B235E comes with is a Garrett GT-17 and is a smaller turbo with lower horsepower rating than the B235R's Mitsubishi TD-04. It won't work with your Aero's ECU tune. You need to change over the turbo from your old motor.

The oil and coolant lines to the GT-17 have bigger banjos and bolts than the TD-04. You can actually use the lines but you need to use the bolts that go with the turbo, and make sure you use a wide enough copper washer to cover the larger banjo hole.",saab

The paint is peeling on the driver's door, but I have a new door in the garage that just needs to be installed.

The new brakes sometimes squeak, but according to the workshop, they just need to be cleaned with a wire brush at the next tire change.

The headlight level sensor is broken, so the headlights are at the lowest setting. It never bothered me.

Nope. Be zealous about changing the fluid and filter and she’ll take care of you.,saab
The bow-legging/cupped rear tires on the 9-5 is due to sagging springs (which are easily fixed with a spacer from JJJ Performance) or bad bushings. ,saab
"Nah I’m in the south but I’m not too far from a big city (Nashville, Birmingham) so I’m sure I can find someone to do it, guess I might as well kill 2-3 birds with one stone and have them put the tires on and balance them while I’m there.",saab
"Usually the service light comes on much quicker, like within 100 miles or so, and it's when the fluid needs topped off after having run through the unit.

The volume of air hitting the MAF sensor is critical as it works on a temperature differential .The ECU might be miscalculating the air intake so inadequate oxygen is leading to inadequate combustion or' pinking like what used to happen with dirty  carburettors.

Nothing comes out the washer nozzles on the hood and it all leaks out before you use it?  There is a pump at the bottom of the reservoir with an o-ring going into the reservoir. Take the front bumper off and fill it up and look and see if that’s where it’s coming from. O-ring might have failed or something caused the pump or hose to fail. Be it old age and a hard enough pot hole. Probably just need to replace a hose or o-ring. It is located right behind the bumper in front of the drivers tires.,saab

"I have a 2008 9-5 aero sportcombi AT 2.3t b235
Exterior 
-front bumper WILL cracking the bottom. after twice replacing i didn’t try to fix it a third time. 
-I have the auto retracting mirrors they will fail. Have yet to find replacements.
Overall grade:A- 

Interior
- cup holder is garbage. Basically useless but small drinks fit. 
- door handles can “pop” off but push right back on
-ignition cylinder may fail these are harder to find but if it goes your car is inoperable. 
-driver side seat cover. This piece has broken twice. Was replaced by first owner under warranty and I replaced it as well. Broke the first week. Not a good design. But it functions. 
-parking brake leather peels away with time as any leather will do. 
Overall the interior is fantastic. Minor issues that are easily accessible and easily fixed.
Overall grade B+ 
Pros-roomy and spacious I’m 6’2 and fit comfortably.
Cons-useless cup holder.

Suspension: front suspension is solid. I replaced due to age of car not necessity at 100,000 because the rear shock had a leak decided to replace all. Sway bar end links last around 50k from my experience before the boots start leaking grease. 
-Subframe bushings. The front bushings usually last a while, however, the mid and rearward bushings are very heavily utilized and wear much more quickly. I replaced with polyurethane. I would highly recommend poly bushes. 
 Overall grade A. 
Easy to work on. 

Rear suspension
-knuckle bushings will go around 100k-120k they’re quite difficult to remove and take a long time. Same as trail arm bushings. The parts are cheap but takes a while to complete. I again recommend poly bushings on these as well. 

Overall grade B-
Stock bushings are poor quality and do not last long.

Engine
-The spark plugs MUST be NGK R for resistor spark plugs. The Standard may damage the direct ignition cassette.

-Vacuum hoses will crack with age. Very cheap. 

-Oil cooler lines always go OEM/genuine. Dorman do not fit. Don’t try. Do not cheap out on proparts..they will leak. O ring is much cheaper than OEM and actually smaller. 

-Oil pressure sensor. At the rear of Engine will leak with age and is a simple fix took me 10 minutes. 

-Boost control valve (has three vacuum hoses on it above turbo attached to cobra pipe) will eventually fail. 

-coolant bypass valve is a piece of shit Cadillac part that GM had thousands of in the garage and decided to curse saab owners with..these will fail. Most likely many times. I’ve replaced four. I’m about to make a custom steel part I’m so tired of replacing 😂

-Water pump
Now having this done for the second time in three years. Cheap part. PITA to remove and replace. 

-Direct ignition cassette. (Like four coil packs in one) I’ve gotten two OEM saab genuine parts. Both failed after 30,000 miles. Both just outside warranty. Expect to replace them at least once. 

-engine mounts
The only one ive had issue with is the one below the elk horn. That is the most stressed mount. All others are good. 

-torque mount your car’s shift will feel much better with a polyurethane bushing as well oem part seems lacking. 

-Throttle body 
I have replaced two of these both under warranty. They somehow fail prematurely. Maybe due to all the heat because it’s right on top of the engine..

-brake booster
These plastic lines become very brittle. I broke it and had to replace when doing a coolant bypass job..

-Intercooler hoses
These do become dry with age and can crack. Mine had a huge gash that lead to a big vacuum leak. Replaced and car pulls like new.

Overall grade:C+
Overall this is a very reliable engine. No major issues and the parts are easy to work on and replace for the most part. The only cons I have are a lot of little things tend to go wrong. Hence the overall grade.

Transmission:
The sealing rings are almost impossible to find. You pretty much have to import them to the USA. 

Fluid replacement: this is a major pain because there’s no dipstick from halfway through model year 2006-. That being said the fluid is jws 3309 which can be found online. Not hard to perform, but it can be difficult to check.

Very solid Aisin transmission.

Overall grade: A+
The scarcity of parts should not deter you. These are very solid units that rarely go bad if maintained properly. 

Exhaust
- may gather rust near muffler. I’ve had no exhaust issues. Only oxygen sensor replacement about every 60k for me. 

Overall grade A+

Overall this car gets:B+

Cost about $250 to replace/reprogram thru guy on eBay.  190k miles need another ecu. I have not added a heat shield to bottom   of ecu.  Texas car.  Brutal summers.  Will do so soon.  Overall parts have not been difficult to find. The car has lost some of it's quickness.  Don't know why.  My SAAB mechanic sent me a letter saying he has stopped working on all GM Saabs.,saab

"I have owned a 2006 and currently own a 2008 9-3 2.0T Sportcombi - they're wonderful cars. Miy '08 has about 110K miles on it and it runs great. BUT it has had a series of annoying electrical issues - rear reverse light, rear fog lights, passenger side automatic door lock fried, then when I replaced the motor, that motor immediately fried. The car is over 15 years old so some of this is bound to happen with age but Saabs are known to have electrical ""gremlins.""

Also make sure you get both sets of keys and take good care of them. Getting a replacement key can be a costly exercise.

Otherwise well it runs great, it's a great car for £1,500 I don't think you could get a cooler car if you tried. Slap some Thule roof bars on it :)",saab

I'd say 3D printed/moulded last at least 3-4 times as long (depending of course on how good the paint is and how good the 3D print is and the conditions the car is in. i'd say in sunny conditions the plastic will yellow faster, in wet and icy conditions, the paint will die faster and the plastic benefit from being one piece)",saab

"Saab 9-5

Body

-Check ""dog legs"" behind rear doors on both sides

-Window rollers on these cars are infamous will become un-aligned or drop windows require replacements, will notice window movement/noise when closing door are early signs, when window needs help getting up you need rollers

-Front bumper lip generally gets taken out if not taken care of on any low surface or steep incline due to low clearance

-OnStar antenna (mounted above rear passenger seats on roof) generally produces a leak due to woes from bad gaskets  

Suspension

-Around 100K these cars get bow legged in back end, look for angled out rear wheels, means ball joins and control arms in your future

Engine

-Cars run Dexcool (orange coolant GM standard) make sure no gunking or mixing of coolant will cause woe

-Oil change interval on these cars pre 06-07 should be just about every 8K SYNTHETIC ONLY, suggested is every 5K

-Auto trans in these cars even though good need to have fluid changes every 100K or you end up with parts of your gears in oil

-DI Cassettes (direct ignition) which sit on top of the valve over, a black one is a Trionic 7 series for newer 9-5s and Viggen 9-3s, generally go every 100K, buy the official Saab parts the generics from China will do in a bind but will fail ahead of their 100K lifespan and misfire. .

-Linears (base models) run a different turbo which generally fails around 150K

-APC is mounted upside down in front of the valve cover (generally first place to check when car is not boosting as it should)

Interior 

-SID Panel (main display for radio, car info and climate control) can fail over time but thankfully be fixed through many easy fixes.

-Check cup holder (99-05 only) these generally are broken cause there so cool

That may not make sense to a lot of people, what I just said, but if you're in a career where color and design are important, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Just give you a real world example... a lot of people in WWII thought fighter planes in the Pacific should be blue because the sky is blue and ocean is blue. But is it really? The Japanese understood this and painted their planes white and tan because they knew skies were often gray and sunsets and sunrises created golden and pink colors. Hell, I know for a fact some of their planes were almost PINK because I'm a picture framer and someone once brought me a piece of a Japanese fighter plane or bomber that was blown up over Midway for me to frame and that thing was a shade of pink, no joke. Anyway, the point is... colors are conceptual when they're in our head but when they're executed they may not do what we envisioned.

Yes. It means your caliper is sticking. Need a new caliper or a rebuild. The piston for the caliper is a screw type. So as it screws out it won’t go back in a certain tolerance. Usually enough for the pad to not contact the rotor but when it gets old and dirt in the caliper (normal with age) it starts to not retract as well and thus ends up eating pads. Your fuel economy is probably down by 1-2mpg on average,saab

"Everything is a concern on a 30 year old car and it's really hard to anticipate the weak parts in any given car. In 1995, the answer probably would have been ""be sure the gearbox works"" but in 2024 it's possible a bigger concern that the weatherstripping is still watertight. Because you can still replace a transmission, but weatherstripping is damn near unobtanium.

Rust will absolutely be The Thing to look for. Often times these cars look great from the top but can have ugly rust in key areas, especially suspension mount points. Metal is metal and can more or less always be fixed of course, but there's an unavoidable financial consideration there. :)

Can't tell for sure, but it looks like this car might be a '90, in which case the odometers are especially prone to failing and then they stop accumulating mileage reliably. Drive it ten miles, make sure the odometer goes up. This can happen to older cars too but it's far, far less common).

Also if it's a '90, many/most ABS & SRS parts are unobtanium. So be sure those work, or have failed in a way you can live with.

I've owned cars from virtually every make (oddly, never a Nissan) and IMO c900s are some of the easiest in the world to work on. Sometimes what you need to do isn't always immediately obvious, but these cars were largely hand built, and everything is pretty easy to work on by hand. If you run into a problem and it looks impossible, chances are you've not thought about it enough. The only truly awful, horrific thing I can think of on a c900 is replacing the SRS brain. It is *buried.*",saab
"Might be one of the heat shields attached to the exhaust rattling. Mine had a similar sound because one of those shields had distached. The shield went all the way around the exhaust, so it was in no danger of falling off, but it sure made that noise for a long time before fixing it",saab

I will say, the plastics and rubbers that GM used on the newer saabs age so badly. Like they just crumble apart eventually. That's a weak point for sure. 

It's difficult to list exactly what is good and what is bad because it changes from car to car. The newer ones mostly had solid engines in my opinion. The 4 cylinders are common so any issues are well known. The 6 cylinders are underrated and besides a few small issues are good engines too.",saab

"I haven't seen anyone here talk about the diesels, so I'll give my own two cents. Feedback from people who are more experienced with these engines is greatly appreciated!

2.2 TiD (Available on OG 9-3, OG 9-5 and NG 9-3 until 2005): bog-standard GM Y22DTR, 125 hp, likes to eat high-pressure fuel pumps.

1.9 TiD/TTiD: Fiat Multijet engine that was shared with GM for both Euro4 (Z19) and Euro5 (A19) emission standards. Single turbo variants were fitted to both the OG 9-5 and NG 9-3 since 2005 until 2012 and was shared with Opel's (CDTi) and Alfa Romeo's (JTD). The twin-turbo TTiD remained only for the NG 9-3 and the only other car to have this engine, the last generation of Lancia Delta.
There are a few variations which I will go over:

Z19DT (120 hp) is the most reliable of the bunch, only suffering from normal diesel issues, like clogged DPF's, EGR valves, injectors, stuff like that.

Z19DTH (150 hp) besides the normal diesel issues, suffers from a failing oil pump pickup seal, which is a cheap part in itself, but it's a bit of a hassle to actually replace it, and if not treated in time, can lead to worn out bearings. The swirl flaps are also said to be brittle and made out of plastic and may have a tendency to just break and fall in the engine.

Z19DTR (180 hp, twin-turbo) has the same oil pump pickup seal issue as the DTH and I have seen quite a few people claim to have had the same swirl flap issue, but I have also been told that the swirl flaps are actually made out of metal and this is consolidated by the fact that the intake ports and manifold are a different shape than that of the DTH. Also, since the turbos sit a bit cramped, you may or may not run into some issues with melted electronics around the turbos. A part I'd be looking out for is the radiator fan controller, which can only be bought as a Saab Genuine part, which costs a lot of money, or you could go and look for second hand ones off of Saabs or 3.0 diesel Opel Vectras/Signums.

A19DTR (130/160/180 hp twin-turbo) same issues as Z19DTR, just upgraded to Euro5 emissions. There might be slight differences in some parts/engine auxiliaries, so check part codes thoroughly.

2.0 TiD/TTiD: A GM derivative of the 1.9 Multijet, not related in any way to Fiat's own second generation 2.0 Multijet. This engine was fit exclusively to the NG 9-5 and was also found in other GM products like the Opel Insignia A and Opel Astra J. It came in 2 flavours for the NG 9-5:

A20DTH (160 hp, single turbo)

A20DTR (190 hp, twin-turbo)

As with the previous generation, these engines became notorious for their oil pickup seal failure (especially since it was such a common issue on the Opel Insignia).

One caveat of the engines fitted with a DPF was that, unlike, for example, VW TDI engines, the regeneration process didn't remember at what state of completion it was at, so if you shut down the engine in the middle of a regen and started it back up, the process would start all over.

3.0 TiD (only fitted to OG 9-5 until the 2006 ""Edna"" refresh): I don't actually know too much about this engine, apart for it being shared with the Isuzu D-Max. I will add to this comment once someone can tell me more about it.

Fun fact: did you know that the NG 9-5 was supposed to recieve a 2.9 liter V6 turbodiesel?",saab
You could also unplug everything while having the car on jack stands and then lift the front of the car to clear the engine using the 1ton hoist.  Use a pallet and a roller to move the engine away. Done!,saab

Any Saab 2.3 from 99-09.  '04 and up are better due to improved PCV system from new.  You can keep the existing ecu and turbo.  If the engine has a knock oil could be contaminated and could affect turbo bearings.  New turbos are not expensive. (Ebay),saab

"On the older 900's (Pre-GM) be sure the car doesn't pop out of gear when in reverse on a Manual transmission -  A sure indication that the reverse gear in the transmission is worn or chipped.  Had 3 with that problem.  Edit:  Thought of another:  Be sure the heat shield for the catylitic converter is still intact.  The 900's were known to have issues with that plugging up, over heating the exhaust and rusting the heat shield quicker than usual.  As a result the floor boards heat up and often can cause the plastic shielding of the E-Brake Cables and the wiring harness to melt.  I had an '84 900's with that issue.

Esaabparts is a trusted place to buy oem parts if they have what you're looking for in stock.

The security issue is involved with the key cylinder passlock system. It might have a fault in the wiring, in which case a dealer visit might be necessary. Or you might bring it back to life with a relearning procedure:

30 Minute Learn Procedure (requires no tools)
1) Turn ON the ignition, with the engine OFF.
2) Attempt to start the engine, then release the key to ON. (engine will not start)
3) Observe the Security telltale, after approximately 10 minutes the telltale will turn OFF.
4) Turn OFF the ignition, and wait 5 seconds.
5) Repeat steps 1 through 4 two more times for a total of 3 cycles (30 minutes). The vehicle is now ready to relearn the Passlock Sensor Data Code and/or passwords on the next ignition switch transition from OFF to CRANK.

IMPORTANT: The vehicle learns the Passlock Sensor Data Code and/or password on the next ignition switch transition from OFF to CRANK. You must turn the ignition OFF before attempting to start the vehicle.

In other words, don't forget the final step 4 before you try to start the car.

6) Start the engine. The vehicle has now learned the Passlock Sensor Data Code and/or password",saab

"Well sadly I tried cranking for very long and no fuel came to the pump. It was dry. However, I believe that I have a small air intake in one of my fuel lines, as I'd think that the pump would still manage to grab a lil bit of fuel. I'll check that out by putting a temporary gas tank near the pump and trying to pump from it, I have clear durits that will be very useful for that purpose. 

Ohhh okay ye I watched a few videos about this type of pump and how to overhaul them, I looked on internet and I could find some kits for bosch pumps ranging between 50 and 100 euros. Soooo, if pumping from the temporary gas tank doesn't work, I'll do as you said. At least I'll be able to fix some oil leaks around the topside of the engine !! (And change the oil since it feels like it has some diesel in it)

Edit : I bought a priming pump, however ... I can't seem to find where I could install it lol, it's not possible in the engine bay since the fuel lines are somewhat rigid and too small to accomodate my priming pump. The other lines, rubber ones, are too big for my pump to fit tightly in them. Any clues ? Maybe I just bought the wrong type of priming pump for my current setup?",saab

"Yeah, got a 3 inch straight pipe on her so she's loud anyway, all she's missing is some explosions 🤣 I get they effect the engines life but if its switchable to the point where I can have it off when wanted then won't be too bad. It's got a lovely over run when downshifting but just want abit of pops and bangs for when I go to car shows and that. I have seen that you can triclone your ecu if you get a spare and then just run a remap on the spare on that pops and bangs but then you'd have to switch over the ecu when you want it so was wondering if anyone had one where it was on a switch in the car",saab
They mean the large seal.  You can leave that filter in or take it out.  It doesn't matter.  It's designed to prevent dirt from getting into the vacuum pump and damaging it.  At this point who cares?  The pumps already worn.  It's out of warranty.  If you are good about 5000 mile oil changes you'll be fine.,saab

"Abso-fucking-lutely. My E46 BMW was the worst car I've ever owned by a mile. The Saab is not only built more solid, but it actually works every day like a real car! BMWs since the 90s have been designed to fail out of warranty, and most manufacturers have since adopted this same design philosophy. I understand the NG 9³ is a bit of a dud in the lineup when it comes to reliability and a lot of people seem to make the mistake of judging the entire brand's reputation based on the NG 9³ (which is arguably the worst Saab ever made). REAL Saabs never had any of those issues. Historically, the other Saabs are bulletproof vehicles.
My two 900s have NEVER left me stranded. Both are over 200k miles. The only things I've done are wear items like alternators, leaking AC compressors and suspension components. I've never not been able to find parts online. My 1 owner, dealer maintained E46, however, left me stranded several times over the six months i owned it. It was only at 140k. Some of the things that broke during my time with it include: 3 window regulators, sunroof mechanism, rear subframe broke due to faulty factory welds, VANOS, rod bearings, throw out bearing... The list goes on. I sold it as scrap. Mercedes are hit or miss. W123s are bulletproof but they can develop lots of little issues with finicky vacuum powered stuff... W124s are cool without AWD. I wouldn't touch the mid 90s/ 2000s Mercs. I wouldn't touch a BMW made after about 1992. Wouldn't touch any post 2003 Saab unless it had an H engine in it either. Contrary to what others have said on here, I believe that ""modern"" and ""reliable"" do NOT necessarily go hand in hand.",saab

"Haha colour aside it’s in great shape, only 70000 miles which is pretty good for an ‘03. I had some issues with the hydraulic system for the soft top. But after some help from a friend we figured out it was just bone dry in the hydraulic fluid reservoir. After a refill it works great.

Turns out the previous owner also lowered it and put a stage 4 maptun on it. Not a huge fan of that on a cab so may go back to stock.",saab
"It was the first year of the new 9-3 Sports Sedan design, and it was *notorious* for electrical gremlins and for using a Secondary Air Intake Valve that was literally never used on that model again. It's a pain in the ass and should be avoided like the plague.",saab
"Does lifting or releasing the clutch change anything? Sounds like either busted dual mass flywheel or rod knock to me. If it's the flywheel is your issue depressing the clutch could change the sound. If rod knock, you're likely looking at a new engine or trip to the junkyard.",saab

"No, this is the adjuster for the timing chain tensioner as others said. 13mm hex gives it away. It is missing a small plastic plunger. There should be a rubber o-ring as well.

"Now I remember. You are right! I've installed that manual pump myself. Otherwise you are crancking a full 20 sec. before start after service. Sorry, It's been 12y a I've had a 2.2.

I am referring to the valves and o-rings inside the pump. Any one could be the culprit. So do a complete overhaul of the pump while you are at it.. I don't know if their is a revision kit available, but the parts should be available in the specialized stores. (Bosch, etc...)",saab

"This is not a common rail diesel with a high pressure pump. So yes, injection pump is the right name.  The injection pump is located under the engine controle module ( it's one unit ) at the front right. There is NO fuel pump in the gastank. The injection pump is responsible for getting the fuel out the tank.

If you look closely, you will find a small manual pump for maintanace puposes in the engine bay. This is to pump the diesel from the tank to the injection pump , for example, after replacing the fuel filter. Filling up the filter is not enough. Just push the manual pump it a few times untill you feel pressure building up. Engine will then start after a few tries. It's normal the car won't start right away. Try this first before ordering an new pump.

You are probably buying a pump+control module, hence why it's expensive. Also you will need a tech2 to install.  If it turns out to be really the pump, i would advise to order subtitute valves or gaskets. EDIT :~~those pumps do not tend to fail.~~  A leaky valve could be drawing air or is returning the fuel back in the tank.",saab

"It depends. If you're looking for a project car to drive and enjoy knowing that you will have to spend more money in the future, then it's a good buy. Bonus points if you're able to do the work yourself. 

However, if you're looking for a daily driver and this is all you currently have available to spend, then it is definitely not a good deal. SAABs are reliable and fun, but parts and mechanics who are capable of working on them are getting scarce.",saab

"As a non-turbo this car likely has ""spaghetti straps"" connecting the engine bay cross member to the front bulkhead. With the lowering, I would strongly advise you to find a full front skid plate (usually fitted to turbo models, but some others).

"Check fuses and relays for cooling fans. Turn the ac on, do the fans kick on as they should? There’s a voltage regulator directly on the fan shroud top connection point that can go bad or the fans themselves. You can disconnect the coolant temp sensor and jump the wire to trigger the fans or disconnect each fan plug and run a wire to the battery to see if they run correctly. If the fans don’t work, it can kill the ecu from heat eventually.",saab

- Steering lock malfunction. Can be dirty contacts inside the ignition switch module. Easy enough to clean and replace or replace without a Tech II. Or the Column Integration Module which can cost $1,000 to replace and needs Tech II to 'marry' to the DICE. 

- on four cylinder engines - Balance chain stretching or chain guide/tensioner failing. Leads to vibration above 2000 rpm without loss of performance. About a 2-4 hour repair plus ~$125 in parts. Timing chain can stretch too. 

- also on Ecotec four cylinder engines - intake valve damage. Shows up as low compression on cold startups. Poor running and power until warm. Incorrect  intake valves were used in production and they deform reducing seal. Valves should be replaced with 'biopower' valves for the Ecotec engines. 

I'm sure there's more that can be added, please feel free to do so.  ",saab

"I'm not sure what mechanic you talked to, but that's crazy. Saabs have approximately the same braking system as most European cars...  the *only* thing that separates Saabs from from other cars is that rather than combining the front calipers into one hydraulic circuit and the rears into another, Saab combines the front left with rear right and front right with rear left. There is no other difference... like essentially all cars made in the last 20 years, there's a vacuum booster which provides force amplification to a hydraulic master cylinder whose output goes through a valve body which can be modulated by the ABS system. You will find the same thing in every car.

IME, Redstuff is crap. You could not pay me to run those pads. They have terrible performance when cold and they melt when hot. The only time they work is some narrow range in the middle. Pretty sure I still have a new set in the garage that I'll never use but am too cheap to throw away.",saab

* 3-spoke wheels
* Front lip spoiler
* Black paint job ONLY
* Bigger front brake disc

Interior:

* Carbon Fiber Interior trim
* Unique steering wheel
* ""Ready for take-off"" message when turning engine over on odometer gauge

Powertrain:

* Will always be the B284R 2.8-turbo V6
* Will always be AWD

Anyone selling anything else is probably selling you a 9-3 that happens to have AWD, and because all SAAB 9-3s are turbo, they're confusing it as a Turbo-X",saab
