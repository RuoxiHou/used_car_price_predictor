"Never seen one for an E46.  I had one for an E36, love the look without the B pillar.",Alpina
Can also DM if you're worried about someone scooping you :). Just really curious about the car and if the market has gone down that much.,Alpina
"What airport is that, cologne?",Alpina
Cool event!,Alpina
"I'd say because if someone has the money for an M car but still wants it to be more comfort and luxury oriented instead of the track. More usable as a daily driver but still as powerful as an M. More elegance than the M models but still deeply rooted in the core of what BMW is.

The other reason would maybe be the looks and exclussive Alpina parts, wheels, paintjobs and whatnot but that would be a minor thing in my opinion.",Alpina
Sweet! I run their tm2p. Vf-2 is a nice machine.,Alpina
Nice plate too,Alpina
"Oh, and the hard top! It‚Äôs not Alpina only, you can find M3s with them too. This hard top was ordered from factory with the car in 2002.",Alpina
"This is what i remember when i was shopping for a b6 as well. If the car was ordered with all season tires there was a electronic limit of 135(130?)mph for the US market. When buying preowned, since original owners may have switched to performance summer tires later, you'd have to check the VIN to see which tire package the car originally came with to determine if there was a limiter. That being said I havn't ever seen anything about removing the limiter later",Alpina
"I was looking for an E39 in general, but this came up, so I went to see it, test drove it, then brought one. I‚Äôve always liked Alpinas, but it wasn‚Äôt until I got a quote on the insurance when I realised I could have one now (I‚Äôm coming up 27, and I have three points on my license from a speeding offence when I was 23)",Alpina
"If it‚Äôs for sale now, then no, it isn‚Äôt.

 I know there is on on UK autotrader that‚Äôs basically the same as my car, but mine has the M sport wheel and a grey interior, where as that one has the normal wheel and a black interior.

I can see where you‚Äôre coming from to be fair, but if you can test drive one, I‚Äôd give it a go and see.",Alpina
"Nice, post pics in the sub when u have her",Alpina
The passenger is appalled at your paparazzi style photography.  (Lots of big words with the letter P.).,Alpina
aight I'll look into it,Alpina
"I‚Äôve got a 2014.  I‚Äôd marry this car, no prenup, if I could I.  There‚Äôs some issues with the turbos being in the valley of the V8 (gets hot).  I‚Äôd vacuum check for leaks.",Alpina
Just replaced the front grill with a black one.,Alpina
"Also obsessed.   There‚Äôs really nothing like an Alpina, IMO.",Alpina
"It's called *Sex Panther*¬Æ by *Odeon*¬©.

It's illegal in 9 countries.

It's also made with bits of real panthers,
*so you know it's good*.

*60% of the time*, it works ***every*** time.",Alpina
"Proper car this! I've looked at them from afar for a while but starting looking seriously as I've decided to sell my Alpine and M340 to consolidate into one car.

I had some concerns around the new screen and ride without on the 20"" wheels so wanted to get a drive. Both put to bed straight away and I really liked the car. Going to have to chat to the dealer next week on numbers.

Long lead time to build from scratch though so will see what may be coming down the pipe that's closer to what I'd spec",Alpina
I love Alpinas but I can‚Äôt say I like that color scheme,Alpina
"Especially tough to find here in the states. My buddy has a CNC business, so the goal was to get a real one to have him model. I‚Äôll call up Alpina! Thanks homie :)",Alpina
ü§î ima check with bmw. Thanks bro,Alpina
I'm in USA... ok thanks I'll look and see if u can contact bmw direct and see if they warranty in usa,Alpina
"At the time, BMW didn't make an M3 Touring.  If they did, and it looked like the latest one, Id have still bought an Alpina.",Alpina
"Gorgeous ride my friend! 
What‚Äôs the color code on your model?",Alpina
Oh yes! Very nice!,Alpina
Congratulations and thank you kindly! Yea I've got a 340 but I've seen a few b7s in my area over the past year. Maybe 2 but Ive seen one on multiple occasions! The first time I saw it I didn't know what an Alpina was and I thought it looked like a bmw but also it looked distinctively different and the roundel was different too and I've been intrigued ever since!,Alpina
"Dude Alpinas are just a totally different vibe to any other ‚Äúsprucing‚Äù aftermarket tweaker. I‚Äôve had some really special cars in the last few years, but my Alpina is the only one I‚Äôve ever felt I could drive into the ground and not want to look elsewhere. Incredible machines.",Alpina
"Absolutely stunning car, OP!

I've wanted to ask a few questions to owners of the g21 B3, it would be great if you could answer:
1) How is the steering feel - if you have a point of reference, say the regular 3 series/ 340i/ M3 - how does it compare?
2) How is iDrive8 to use, in day to day life - are there any significant irritants due to lack of physical buttons for things like climate control? On the other hand, are there areas where you feel it is much better than iDrive7?
3) How is the ride on the 20 inch wheels/ Pirelli's with thin side walls? Do you have to be particularly careful on rough roads?

4)Lastly, how is it like to drive on twisty roads? Again, if you have a point of reference such as the M3, how does it compare? (I'm interested in the day to day drive rather than track)


Also, curious to know if there are any specific Alpina touches that make the day to day ownership experience better over a regular BMW...",Alpina
"Yes, at Legends. I don't have anywhere central yet for the Alpina meet ups. Trying to figure out the best place. There is a generational difference in where owners use social media. Some use FB, some use IG, some are very private and only use email or phone.",Alpina
"thank you! makes me grin every time I drive it. I'm already in the process of buying another E46 wagon, this time of the 320d variety",Alpina
"Yeah they can look pretty good like!

"My dad has a 2018 B7, bought with 50k miles. Be prepared to go through tires and brakes rather quickly. Has been mostly trouble free for more than 25,000 miles, only needed control arm replacements.",Alpina
"Goals if I‚Äôve ever seen them. I love how even the newer models have the feel of the older ones like the badging on the engine cover, I‚Äôm a fan.",Alpina
Is that your airplane?,Alpina
where did you buy the wheels and what not from?,Alpina
"I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre fakes of the Alpina wheels specifically, they‚Äôre a fairly generic design. I only have hands on experience with Alpinas 20 spoke forged wheels (the classic design) so I‚Äôm not 100% sure what to look for, but whatever it is you won‚Äôt find it. These are absolutely not the wheels you linked. I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre Alpina in any way. Those centre caps can be bought for $5 on eBay.",Alpina
Agreed,Alpina
I designed the front spoiler using Tinkercad. You can find and download the STL file here to feed your slicer and then to your 3D printer. https://www.tinkercad.com/things/4e8gF2orNVl,Alpina
"It wasn't a prolonged drive but I think from a comfort perspective it's about the same but bear in mind it runs 20"" versus my 19s which is pretty impressive. The real difference is in the engine. That S58 both sounds better and packs a bunch more power than the B58. A compelling amount more!",Alpina
"Did u find any info about common issues?

Heres some info

In 1998, BMW introduced the first technical update of the M52 engine with double-VANOS ‚Äì variable valve timing ‚Äì on intake and exhaust camshafts. As part of the same update, the M52B28US cast iron engine block was replaced by an aluminum engine block with steel cylinder liners. Alpina choose to retain the M52 single-VANOS and cast iron engine block. This required a change to the engine block of the US version of the M3 3.2.
The E4/4 engine is based on the S52B32 engine from the US-spec M3 3.2 with 240bhp (179kW) and 320Nm. This engine was introduced in the E46 B3 3.3 in early 1999. Modifications include custom engine block, crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, cylinderhead, intake camshaft, intake, exhaust manifold, exhaust and reprogrammed engine management. Exhaust camshaft, oil pump and oil pan are sourced from the US-spec M3 3.2. Radiator is sourced from the hot-climate version of the E46 3-series. The E4/5 engine is a slightly modified version of the E4/4, to fit the E39 5-series. It was introduced in the E39 B10 3.3 in early 1999.



The B3 3.3 engine is based on the S52B32 engine from the US-spec E36 M3 3.2 with 240 hp. The cylinder head and the single-VANOS system have more in common with the BMW M50 engine than any M-engine, with a regular M50 intake and hydraulic valve lifters.
Alpina increased the bore to 86.4mm as well as a longer stroke (94mm). The cylinder head is tuned in traditional fashion as well a new exhaust manifold. Extremely light pistons as well as a newly developed crankshaft have been used in conjunction with a new torsional-vibration damper, sustaining permanent revs of up to 7200 rpm with ease. The engine produces 280 bhp at 6100 rpm and a torque of 335 Nm at 4300 rpm. The new B3 3.3 is also very frugal, only 9,9 litre/100 km in mixed driving conditions",Alpina
"Thanks for the tip! 
Yeah I thought I might have some suspension noise at first but I think it‚Äôs just noisy center caps. Will look at finding some sort of foam strips to close the wiggle room. 
Thanks again!!",Alpina
That‚Äôs beautiful! Not a fan of tuning but you do you. Congrats on this cool car!,Alpina
"Isn‚Äôt it nuts how much more special they feel!? Ms are awesome but they feel sterile. Alpinas feel like something incredibly special and unique. Every time I look at the badge under my centre console cluster, I get a childlike buzz. 339. Means nothing to the clueless, but to anyone who knows about Alpina, it‚Äôs one of the very many special touches that reminds you that you‚Äôre in something truly special.",Alpina
Yall don‚Äôt have the b5? I thought you could only get the b5 saloon in NA.,Alpina
Can‚Äôt you just use the sim card from your phone?,Alpina
"I used some window sealing tape/foam for the fallen of pads. It holds up so far and cost basically nothing.

The Alpina emblens are sadly not so nice anymore and I have look were I get new ones for the center caps.",Alpina
"They‚Äôre clearly not the same wheel, look at the spokes, they‚Äôre all connected half way on the Alpinas, not on yours",Alpina
I have a 2014 with Dinan exhaust! Love the Alpina Blue.,Alpina
"Yes it is normal, it‚Äôs from the heat over time.",Alpina
"I'll look into it:)

Might as well do an F10, F30, and F01ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Alpina
"It is a E36 but somehow it looks dull, no leather airbag and the ALPINA emblem looks pretty high up to me. Should be lower.",Alpina
DREAM CAR !,Alpina
"It is temping and you are right, I should probably try both. BMW (and Alpina obviously) certainly know how to do silky 6-cylinders that for sure.",Alpina
Thank you!! Happy Memorial Day to you as well! üá∫üá∏,Alpina
Beautiful car! More pictures please‚Ä¶,Alpina
"I just shared this post from the BMW subreddit, it‚Äôs a good point though. I don‚Äôt know about the Polestar at all. Would probably opt for a B3 instead of the Diesel if it was me.",Alpina
"How do you like the sound? I didn't see Dinan making exhaust for the 2012, but might have missed it. I've considered fabbing my own muffler that could reuse to valved tip for ""sport,"" mode.",Alpina
"This is one mean machine. Congrats on the buy.
Would love to own one of those, pre facelift, one day.",Alpina
"Dunno, mine are factory standard",Alpina
"At about $80 a pop, right?",Alpina
Mine is. I'm guessing it's from heat yellowing the plastic.,Alpina
I've only had the car a couple days and it is a joy to drive,Alpina
"Thanks man, appreciate the time to write that all out. Will help me with whatever direction I end up going.",Alpina
looks meancing,Alpina
Right on. I figured they'd be small to get that detail. What machine are they cutting it on?,Alpina
I wanted to say the same on the original post in the BMW sub - It‚Äôs not my post here. I just wanted to share it with you.,Alpina
Hey guys. Great to have some Alpina fans here together,Alpina
Ha! You are kind‚Ä¶send a picture of yours when you get a moment‚Ä¶,Alpina
"E39 b10 is what I want but my wallet says keep driving e91 d3‚Ä¶ 
Beautiful car",Alpina
"Lovely. Are on an island or a coast?

I like your 21‚Äù forged CS16 on 4S for the summer and C15 Classic in 20‚Äù for the winter on AS4 :-)",Alpina
that's exactly what I'm thinking ü§î,Alpina
"I got the wheels from Aliexpress. They sell the 1:18 alpina wheels but in 19‚Äù size. So i asked them to print them 20‚Äù size and they did. Just found this amazing item on AliExpress.

Alpina green is pretty slick,Alpina
Dope,Alpina
"My manual has pretty long gearing, but I have family up in Northumberland, so it‚Äôs perfect for the trip up there from the midlands, plus I think it suits the character of the engine, I find it quite torquey, and that‚Äôs coming from someone who‚Äôs previous car was an ex-police traffic car diesel",Alpina
Let me know if they have Alpina car covers for the F06 B6.  lol.  A buddy of mine visited Germany and they were out.,Alpina
u/EmployNeither7626,Alpina
"Still able to have a comfy quiet ride when you want to, or is it always nuts?",Alpina
"Yeah makes sense. These things were more luxury cruisers than balls out sports, the B10 even more so I imagine. But I just love the subtle but aggressive styling of the e46. What model code is your b10? NA or turbo? Any pics?

My other car is a 2016 335d, x-drive, 640nm torque and 8 gears, if it made noises like the B3 there really would be very little reason to drive anything else üòÇ, brilliantly engineered cars.",Alpina
"I think Alpina is such a classy make, it‚Äôs perfect in the way it is. I consider M cars more eligible for tuning. But as long as it‚Äôs just software I think it‚Äôs on the better side of tuning. Just my opinion of course, don‚Äôt rely on what a stranger says haha",Alpina
What is the numbers difference?,Alpina
"Yes.

"I think you got the same wood as my B10, or at least similar. I just like seeing the interiors tbh.

Will have to take pics of mine when I take it on its first seaside trip under my ownership.",Alpina
Nope,Alpina
"The main issue with 7 series cars is that they build so few of them that every part for them tends to be eye wateringly expensive. The N63TU is not the concern really, it‚Äôs every other part. Have a look at lower control arms, brake rotors etc. parts you will probably need looking down the road, they all come with a premium. That being said, for $30K you will not find a more luxurious ride anywhere. Take it from a 2015 B6 owner, you will not be disappointed!",Alpina
Lovely stuff,Alpina
pretty sure you're the reason they parked there haha,Alpina
"Congrats man :), keep us updated!",Alpina
We need a east coast meet!!,Alpina
üòç,Alpina
"yeah he's done a ton of work to keep it in good shape, and it drove awesome. it wasn't clean since I kind of sprung my visit on him, but the paint is in great condition. it's honestly my favorite spec of it that I've seen, and I think I'm going to pull the trigger",Alpina
Maybe a bit more of a subtle white,Alpina
"so so so so so so so beautiful

edit: do she have side decals? ü•π",Alpina
Nice! Congrats! üôåüèº,Alpina
"Idrive is one of the first ones and it‚Äôs problematic, It didn‚Äôt work when I got the car. The list of all the random stuff I need to fix or get is long and I‚Äôm still nowhere rear the end. You can still get new shift knob and floor mats from alpina website for E9x. (Next things in my list)",Alpina
"Yes, an Alpina badge on the bonnet is a bit snobbish. Better make it original again.",Alpina

"At my age I will take the B6, my back can‚Äôt take the beating.",Alpina
Oh didn‚Äôt see the shipping price. It yes they are coming from Germany usually. You come out ahead when you order wheels though!,Alpina
Dream vehicle‚Ä¶,Alpina
No worries. No matter what it's going to look good! Show us installed next.,Alpina
"That generation 5 series was a great platform. I had the F02 7 series and it was hard to tell the difference when I sat in the front seat of my buddy‚Äôs 535i. The 2013 is a great year even for the V8 because that‚Äôs the year they revised it and greatly increased reliability. Congrats. 

If those are powder coated OEM Alpina wheels you‚Äôre sitting on a small fortune worth of Alpina CS16 forged wheels! 

If those were original to the car they might be these: https://www.alloywheelsdirect.net/bmw_alloy_wheels/5_series_f10_alloys/20_bmw_410_wheel_2289

This was a rare choice in the US market but was more common in the EU. 

These should all be 20 spokes I believe. Not 21, that would add to the mystery!

Either way you got a great car with gorgeous wheels! I wish you many happy years and miles with it. Take care!",Alpina
Sadly missing the right wheels‚Ä¶beautiful otherwise,Alpina
‚Äò14,Alpina
I read once that the B7 is the only non-governed BMW NA vehicle sold over here.,Alpina
Do they have the same issues as the 650? I know they share the same engine and they can be nightmares when something goes wrong.,Alpina
I def recommend it. But measure how far you want to me to be from where they‚Äôre at now. I‚Äôve had 20mm spacers on for 7+ years without issue.,Alpina
"Mine as well. Why I bought one üòé
I might be importing another one at end of this year but to sell.",Alpina
"Damn that's a good deal and not bad. I mean, luckily, the strut was covered under warranty. Do you know how much that job would if cost you out of pocket?",Alpina
Sounds like I‚Äôm fucked then,Alpina
What a treat!  The chance of 2 Alpinas being in the same parking lot at the same time is exceedingly low.,Alpina
Fy fan vad snygg‚Ä¶ och svin dyrt!,Alpina
That‚Äôs my dream car. Honestly who would have the nerve to let that car get within a 50 mile radius of a pothole.,Alpina
Hello :),Alpina
Measure how much room you have from the tire to the arch. Buy the appropriate spacer,Alpina
I also designed and printed the brake calipers (front) https://www.tinkercad.com/things/gcbcOOPkXqe,Alpina
"with a few exceptions, most cars aren't eligible to bring over the pond to the US until they're 22 years old. and at that point you have to pay around 30k for them to meet EPA and NHTSA minimums. if you wait until they're 25 years old, which will be in 2027 for this beauty, they're excempt from meeting any kind of restrictions and you can freely import them without issue",Alpina
"Me too, even Morgan has a subreddit for at least 8 years. Even the thought, that there have been so many Alpina posts in r/Bmw, but no one ever thought of making an Alpina only sub is weird.",Alpina
That's way overpriced.  I'm in the market too and right now there is 2019 for that same price with 30k miles. This dealer in Kansas is also just overpricing everything.but for a 2019 I don't expect to pay more than 64 to $65k and with 45k miles I would say it should be closer to $60k . Assuming it has most of the packages.,Alpina
Dan een D5 :-),Alpina
Thanks! A few e9x came with them. Love them,Alpina
"I was also very sure that the Valve stem is the giveaway, but as it turns out there are also real Alpina rims with outside valve, is there not?",Alpina
That‚Äôs awesome,Alpina
Is that a soft top?,Alpina
"That‚Äôs interesting. I have a 2016 B6 and have had it to 140 mph.  I did read somewhere that if you ordered the car with all-season tires, the car was limited on top-speed.",Alpina
Why not just paint or powdercoat them? Shouldn't cost too much.,Alpina
Ur car hot asf,Alpina
Have you pics from Interieur? Such a beauty!,Alpina
I have a friend who works for bmw who able to look it up for me. Not public knowledge unfortunately,Alpina
"Yeees... which bit you interested in?

Great two car solution,Alpina
That is pretty awesome if it is real,Alpina
Ya you‚Äôre probably right. Well thanks for the help anyway lol Silver lining is at least theres a guy that‚Äôs willing to give me $1500 for them as they are now so either was it‚Äôs a win in my book ü§£,Alpina
"Didn‚Äôt notice that, to be fair",Alpina
"[pics of mine](https://imgur.com/a/MmSVIG9)
If you‚Äôre interested",Alpina
I think they weigh 22 lbs. I‚Äôve got a single front at the office I can weight for you Monday.,Alpina
"You‚Äôve made an absolutely wonderful choice. I currently own an E46 ZHP which was the nicest non-M spec you could get in the US. But I‚Äôm on to Alpina dreams myself ‚Ä¶ far fewer choices here but some nice examples to be found here and there. I‚Äôll be back with a post here someday. Thank you for the inspiration. 

Enjoy your beautiful Alpina in good health (for both you and the car) ‚Ä¶ and beware of your country‚Äôs omnipresent speed traps!",Alpina
"That is my dream car. Best of both worlds, e39 and Alpina",Alpina
That‚Äôs a nice one! Congrats!,Alpina
Nice. These seem like a bit of a bargain at the moment.,Alpina
"You have been a terrific help I really appreciate it. These actually seem the most plausible as the spokes are thin + this is the first wheel anyone sent me that actually has 21 spokes like the wheels in the photo. Thanks so much, I really need to just take the wheels off and figure out for myself.

Edit: to add. I don‚Äôt think these are factory black wheels they‚Äôre either powder coated or painted another way but I am a mechanic idk much about body or cosmetic work including how you‚Äôd paint a rim black. This is a F10 2013 5 series so not an alpina, the car was just in great condition so I purchased it not caring if the wheels were real alpina or even decent wheels but upon further inspection they seem very quality and not just some replica but again what do I know.",Alpina
Nope. There should not be a valve stem visible on that wheel model. They should instead look [like this here](https://imgur.com/a/6nGSALl),Alpina
"I only have 23k miles now. So I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I imagine it could be possible, however many of the issues were worked out by the 2015 model year.",Alpina

"Yeah, I was looking for a manual rwd car but this just happened to come up for sale 4 miles away from my family I was visiting over Christmas. I fell in Iove with the looks and the sound. I'm used to ZF boxes and even this gen was ahead of it's time. I drive it mostly in manual mode, using the lever as a sequential and it's pretty good and drive-able although I suspect it will benefit from a fluid change if not a reconditioning. Manual swap is an option but is off the table for now as I'm aiming for almost completely stock OEM. Having said that Angel eye mod is definitely on the list and maaaaaybe rear differential swap to shorten the ratios as it's all a bit long right now.",Alpina

Cream ? Fuck yes !,Alpina
It will continue to depreciate. These are awesome cars but not investment cars. You're buying at a better time in the market. I paid 32 for mine a bit over a year ago because it was peak low inventory and alpinas are hard to find in my area. I'm selling mine now because I'm starting a business and just want to lighten the load and I expect it's worth about 25-26k in my local market. But much of the drop of the overall market and not just Alpina depreciation.,Alpina

"I just got some brand new 20"" CS16 Classic wheels similar to yours and I'm having the opposite problem for now ... they're very tight when I put them on and hard to turn the key to get them on and off. However they've gotten a little looser over the past 1000 miles. I guess I'll have to keep inspecting and eventually doing the foam pad thing. 

Your car looks GREAT! Enjoy in good health. Happy Memorial Day!",Alpina

"The ZF gearbox isn‚Äôt a weak point for these cars. Same gearbox in the M5, they are STRONG. Asking how long it will last is a really tricky question to answer, but from my experience I‚Äôve taken my last 2 BMW‚Äôs to almost 100k miles (e39 m5 and e60 m5) with no significant repairs.  I service my cars religiously and I take oil samples each time to head off any major issues. Maybe I‚Äôve been lucky, but I‚Äôve bought fantastic used cars at well below 1/2 of retail and driven them for years. Total cost of owner ship with the last 2 was about $3,500 -$4,000 a year, you can‚Äôt lease a Kia for that!",Alpina
"It‚Äôs going to be tricky for sure. It‚Äôs hard to get any parts from the 90‚Äôs these days. The upside is that there are lots of BMW parts that can be had. 

I got the parts list from Alpina for my B6, there‚Äôs about 1500 parts that are Alpina exclusive, not sure how that compares to what you‚Äôre looking at.",Alpina

"I bought a 2018 with 41K miles on it, back in 2020 and paid $64 for it. Only issues in the last 3 years were:  
1) Passenger front suspension would not level the car (air suspension) and was replaced under warranty, right before it ran out.  
2) Had to replace one of the batteries and the battery conditioner after the car sat through the winter in the garage and would not charge. That set me back $1,100 at the dealer + $100 for a battery tender which is now connected to the car",Alpina
Thank you!,Alpina
Now that‚Äôs a ride!,Alpina
Hello,Alpina
Looks good! I make custom parts myself and are always torn over tool marks vs. paint or coating it.,Alpina
"Fuel consumption is not its strong suit, however the comfort and sheer heaps of power it delivers are worth it. I've been commuting mostly motorways with heavy traffic this winter. About 80 kilometres single journey and it sets about 11 to 12 l/100km. Noticeably higher usage on lighter traffic days. 
On long trips it's much much better I've been able to get 650km out of 50 liters of fuel at some point. Autobahn again being a different story, I've also seen stops of only 400 kilometer for about the same fillings.",Alpina

"I was looking at E46 330ci‚Äôs and E36 328i‚Äôs before i brought this as the insurance on a E39 530i was too high for me, but this came up on AutoTrader and it was cheaper to insure than all my other options (probably due to Alpina buyers tending towards the middle age demographic), and it meant I could get an E39, which is my favourite saloon in terms of design with a I6 (love me a 6cyl car) and a manual gearbox.

I was very much aware of Alpina before seeing this and lusted after them, but thought I‚Äôd be unlikely to get the opportunity to won one til I was 40, so of course I went for it almost as soon as I saw the ad, and other than the odd bit of maintenance (replacing the sills as they had rotted, and the water pump), she‚Äôs a wonderful thing to have.",Alpina

Yes! And August so long time waiting!,Alpina
"Should be about 570hp and 644lb.ft of torque. You can self-load the tune from Dinan for $299, and then you need two MAP sensors which are $160 a piece. Technically you don't need them I guess, but they provide overboost protection by going to the new part number, so it's safer.

So for about $620, if you can do the labor yourself, you get 80hp and 140+ torque.",Alpina
" I can't believe it took me 6 months to edit and upload this video! But like the video says, I brought my 1997 Alpina B6 2.8 Touring wagon up to the Legends of the Autobahn West 2023 show.

"Lovely. Was not familiar with this one. Would that be a B3? Did you compare against getting an E46 M3 and if so what do you like better about this beauty?

Great color and nice hard shell too (Alpina only?)",Alpina
"B3s is based on the b58 while the b3 has the n55. Both of these are reliable as long as it is maintained correctly (even with tuning) But remember if an Alpina specific item breaks, it usually costs more than a Bmw because it‚Äôs still a small car manufacturer.",Alpina
"Not too much, not real Alpina's I'm afraid.",Alpina
Amazing car...a real gem...,Alpina
"It looks better than I expected, but I‚Äôve been wondering about this. Why does Alpina not offer it from the factory? After all, they put their emblem on the wheel caps. Why not the hood?

Personally, I like having the traditional BMW logo on my B7. The car blends in a little bit better in a parking lot.",Alpina
Ugh. üò©,Alpina
Nice car!,Alpina
"So far so good. Drove it from PDX to Vegas and back last November for SEMA and it soaked up the miles and never let me down. Made the last 4 hours of the drive home with COVID and a fever tolerable so I didn't have to stop. 

The starter is a little noisy on first start, so I may change that in the next year, but otherwise it's great. Where you at and how much are they asking?",Alpina
"Yeah, it's walnut I believe. The interior is in pretty good nick for 100k miles / 20 years, although quite a safe choice of black. It doesn't have the badged seats as this option wasn't specced. A bit of wear on the front seats and oddly passenger arm rest. Hoping to restore much of it and the steering wheel with some leather products. In fact I went a bit mad buying detailing products on the interwebs last night üòÇ. More pics and updates on my insta @car_wibble. üëç",Alpina

Replace the timing chain if it hasn‚Äôt been done already.,Alpina
85-87. This one doesn‚Äôt seem to be on the registry or archive so not certain on exact year or if its a re-bodied car.,Alpina
That‚Äôs for sure- lack of quad exhaust a dead giveaway!,Alpina
"Also see how on the Alpina‚Äôs all the quad spokes are rounded towards the centre where yours just end separately. It‚Äôs definitely not the same, someone just added Alpina centre caps to a random wheel",Alpina
"I would say so, but to be fair I am biased. To back up my claim, the V8 E39s (including the M5) have reciprocating ball steering, which isn‚Äôt as direct and doesn‚Äôt give as much feel as the rack and pinion on the straight 6s, and the V8 Alpina E39s only came with automatics, whereas if you insist on a manual, the straight 6s did come with the option of a manual, which mine has.

The M5 has more power and still has a manual (6 speed, whereas mine has a 5 speed), but it will cost a fair bit more to buy and run. 

To be clear, I love the E39 M5, it‚Äôs one of my dream cars, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd replace my Alpina with one unless my car becomes completely uneconomical to repair for whatever reason, or if I had the money to have both at the same time.",Alpina
Collect mine next week!,Alpina
We‚Äôll tire came off I had the guys check the interior on the spokes have a few marking and 2 specifically say they‚Äôre manufactured in Germany by alpina. So I think I‚Äôm gonna run by the bmw deal ship and have them take a look,Alpina
"I was able to scoop this with 76,XXX miles for $18.5 It needed a high pressure fuel pump which I replaced in 45minutes. This car was WAY underpriced at its listing price of $23k but it was a very unique situation for the sale and I even became friends with the seller. I am absolutely obsessed with this car and hope to keep it for a very long time. New BMWs are so edgy and sharp with the body lines. I love how elegant and classic bmw this looks. It is an absolute missile on the highway and the power is addicting paired with the quiet and lush ride. Best of luck on your search! I‚Äôll keep an eye out as well",Alpina
Yeah i feel that. Replaced a wheel on my b6 recently and they quoted me $350 if i needed a centercap...thankfully i didnt. I did need to replace the little foam pads on the back tho and from online vendors found out they go for $9 PER PAD and there are 5 per cap. Needless to say i just used some old 1/8in adhesive backed foam i had laying around and it did the job perfectly,Alpina
Hi thanks for taking the time to reply. Yes it is a UK rhd with just over 100k miles on the clock. Spoke to the owner earlier and I have a good feeling about it as he clearly was an enthusiast and cared about his car. Will look into common e46 and 3.4 issues. Many thanks.,Alpina

"Hard to tell. Is this car supposed to be an Alpina, or just Alpina wheels? Alpina, until the last few years I believe, had their tire fill in the center under locked flip out cap behind the Alpina crest. These wheels have the bmw logo instead, and an outside tire fill valve.",Alpina

You shouldn't be able to see the air pressure nipple. Its hidden in the centre if its an Alpina.,Alpina
"I meant how many miles do you think I could get out of it on the odometer. Since the car has 54k miles I‚Äôll probably put around 7,000 miles a year max. My main concern is I‚Äôm going to trade my relatively reliable lease car in an and then not be able to drive this car because it will always be broken. I also worry about the transmission giving out. I‚Äôve heard these cars go through transmissions because they were modified for faster shift times than the 750. I just don‚Äôt want to get into the car and then next thing you know the dealer buys it back because they don‚Äôt want to repair it.",Alpina

I drove it yesterday and it‚Äôs so impressive to me that this massive car can push you back in your seat the way it does. I also have been after something a little bit more unique than what I have.

"No problem ;), maybe u/Sweet-Bid-3408 can give you the measurements from his b10 and you‚Äôll just need to change the 4.8 to a 4.6. Doesn‚Äôt seem that impossible if alpina can‚Äôt help you.",Alpina

"I think my year one hits the 25 year rule next year, so you could try and find one in Germany or France and import it at that point to get it in LHD, but I believe these are rarer than the V8s.

Most parts are fairly easy though in BMW terms, engine stuff is mostly 528i/530i stuff, and breaks are similar to 540i items. Shock absorbers I‚Äôd have to go 3rd party, Alpina apparently don‚Äôt supply the originals any more.",Alpina

Beautiful!!!,Alpina
"I daily a 2016 B6 and the choice was pretty easy. Not only is there a pretty convincing motortrend head-to-head favoring the B6 driving characteristics over the M6 but jeremy clarkson also preferred the same gen B5 over the M5. A track focused 4 seater makes a lot less sense than a comfy 4 seat highway missile. Personally 4wd and heated steering were must haves that the M6 lacked entirely and I also prefer moonroof to carbonfiber for night driving and clouding/rainy days. Both are gorgeous cars but the B6 just looks more special to me, especially stock.",Alpina
"Took apart completely the dealer model and painted all the parts using the factory paint. Designed and 3D printed the front spoiler, the exhausts and the brake calipers and discs.",Alpina
Already seen it on r/bmw. Nice to see that you found the sub and congrats on ur car.,Alpina
Nice. De-badged too.  Even more subtle.,Alpina
"Not sure if I‚Äôm too late to the party, and maybe you‚Äôve already bought the car, but I can help. Bodywork is the main problem with all E46 models. They rust like nobody‚Äôs problem; I spent a small fortune getting all of mine properly addressed and preserved.

The B3 uses the Alpina modified version of the E36 M3 (US) S52 engine, in either 3.3L or 3.4L displacement. Generally a strong engine with a lot of popularity. Awesome smooth power delivery and reliable. They don‚Äôt like cold weather when not being used, sending the oil cap milky, but not usually a catastrophic problem. I have heard of head gaskets blowing, but I‚Äôve also heard of that on 330ci models, etc. These are hand-built engines that are capable of over 300,000 miles if looked after right.

They like to be used. Mine was stored for over 7 years before I bought it. First thing I did was replaced everything. Full service. Mine penalises me every time I park it in the garage with some sort of minor electrical gremlin. These are over 25 years old after all.

Alpina specific parts are near impossible to get hold of - even going direct to Alpina. I replaced the shot Alpina shocks when they went (I think they used Sachs?) for Bilstein B8 and contrary to people on the internet, there‚Äôs no difference. The magic is in the springs on this model. Smooth and forgiving yet poised and sturdy in the corners.

Overall, great cars. Good luck!",Alpina

"Many thanks, friend!",Alpina
I agree the price quoted for a 30k mile turn key swap is decent. And I appreciate the explanation! My concern I suppose is if there‚Äôs 135k on everything else if it‚Äôs worth just repairing the solenoids and sleeves although spending much less would be preferable.,Alpina

You are paying the high price without getting the new look ( although i get its a personal taste). Look up Edmunds and you'll see the prices.",Alpina
Yep it was about $650 in parts including a new filter/pan and ZF6 fluid. It took the better part of a day to do the repair. You'll also want something like ISTA to reset transmission adaptations. But otherwise not too difficult of a job. Shifts great now.,Alpina
"Went to see the car and was able to make a deal! Will post some photos and more information next week. 
In the final stages of a massive master bed/bath renovation before my first unborn son arrives in 3.5 weeks!! Ahhhhh I guess all the money I saved doing it myself will allow me some budget to really make then B7 pristine. 

Front bumper valiance lip could use a fresh coat of paint and minor repairs.  The only other flaw with the vehicle I could find was that the rear window shade needs a tad bit of persuasion to get it to go down. I like to have little projects to tinker with anyhow. 

First to-do on the list is take it to the tint shop. I find it extremely satisfying to keep an older car completely working and in good shape. Previous owner just spent over 2k on new Michelin sport plus tires so I think it‚Äôs safer to assume corners haven‚Äôt been cut during its maintenance life",Alpina

"This sounds pretty standard for a mechatronics sleeve and solenoid fix. If I was doing it again for someone else I'd probably charge about $700 in parts and a day's labor. 

The sleeves themselves are very cheap and easy to replace, and often fix the issues. Once the mechatronics unit is out of the way it takes 60 seconds to do the seals. I opted to do the solenoids because I'm already in there and already had the mechatronics loose to get to the seals, so it seemed like another $380 in parts to ensure those were good was no big deal at that point.

$2500 isn't bad for a turn-key transmission swap, but may be overkill for what you're experiencing.",Alpina

You should be able to tell from the inner markings when you take off the wheels.

But if it were me and I had a transmission already out of the car, even with only 30k, I'd be doing the seals anyways. Perhaps not the sleeves, but definitely seals. It's an hour job with the transmission on a bench really.",Alpina

Why can't bmw just keep this grille design for their current m cars? Their design department is drunk as hell.,Alpina
"Oof. Looking forward to seeing what you built! There were a couple at the dealership, one silver/grey and one black. The black one looked very smart but I'm going to struggle to look past the green",Alpina
I stand corrected!! As I said I only really know about the classic 20 spokes so these ‚Äòdynamic‚Äô wheels aren‚Äôt my specialty,Alpina
Oh nice! Did you build from scratch? How long did you wait for the car?,Alpina
Yeah too bad I moved to Europe:/ Cars are way more expensive over here unfortunately,Alpina
"yeah dude I'm really thinking about making it happen, this one is right in that range. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't taking crazy pills for considering paying almost 20k for an old e46 lol",Alpina
Dat is inderdaad nu mijn plan. Eerst kijken in de webshop van Ottomobile en dan pas een auto kopen ü§£,Alpina
Awesome! Thank you!  Love the colour.,Alpina
"If I could get this in the US, I wouldn‚Äôt need any other car ever.",Alpina
"sweet, so I'm not insane. this one is listed at 20, I think I'll try to talk him down to like 18",Alpina
I‚Äôm in Canada where it‚Äôs only 15 years,Alpina
I‚Äôm more lucky with interior in that case but mine is high milage and I bought for half the market value and in rough condition (nothing a little elbow grease can‚Äôt fix),Alpina
absolutely stunning,Alpina
"Great series. Different engine, not that I'm saying it's better or worse.

OP I've had a 2012 for a little over a year. I rebuilt the mechatronics to fix a shifting issue, and have kept up on maintenance, but so far no issues with my N63 in about 7000 miles. It's been Dinan tuned since about 20k miles and has 77000 now.

I'll say the biggest enemy of these N63 engines is heat. Now, Alpina did upgrade much of the cooling which helps, but this engine design still runs very hot. So driving it hard and immediately shutting it off and letting it cook will accelerate many of the issues these have with cooking oil and couldn't lines, bad turbos, etc.

Always give yourself cool down time if you've really been in the throttle. Maybe even remove the engine cover and store it as that's just a heat trap .

With it being a 2014 you should have the N63TU as the base that Alpina built on, which was also slightly better than the N63 but still had some issues. 

Overall these engines did have problems. Did they earn their reputation? For some, absolutely. But, the Internet is full of problem cars. Not nearly as many posting about their trouble free experience, but they're out there.

If it has good maintenance history and you can either fix the stuff that goes wrong, or have a good warranty, go for it. They're amazing cars, truly. I drove from Vegas to Portland Oregon in a day last year, in the winter, and it truly is an amazing touring car. It did that trip there and back over 4 days with zero issues.",Alpina
Beautiful B7 and view!,Alpina
I just think it suits the lighting of an early evening,Alpina
"I‚Äôll send you my invoices if you‚Äôre interested.
Pm me your email adres",Alpina
"You‚Äôll be very disappointed when you start seeing the 320d //M alpina line models then. 
The 216i alpina line will certainly be a low point. Just look what merc did when they bought AMG in ‚Äò99‚Ä¶ now all I see Is A180 AMG lines. Very sad day for us.",Alpina
I love my 2020! N63TU3 in the G12 got a blow off valve so it makes even more fun noises!,Alpina
"Make sure that the N63 CCP is done. And proof that all maintenance has been done on time. Runs amazing car if it‚Äôs been cared for, a nightmare, if not.",Alpina
I‚Äôve got to upgrade mine soon.  My 2014 is approaching 100k.,Alpina
"Pics of the interior if you go on my user thing on reddit from old posts on here, car phone included!",Alpina
just got a 07 b7 have no problems mechanically at all just stupid electrical shit and maintenance that comes naturally with that old of a car.,Alpina
"Thank you! That is how I became interested in them as well. I had seen one while on a ski trip in Europe and thought wow, was a beautifully modified bmw. It wasn‚Äôt years later until I found out that Alpinas were modified directly during production and in limited numbers. This one has a list of items I‚Äôd like to replace and keep it as stock + as possible. I was lucky enough to purchase one that hasn‚Äôt been molested or touched in anyway. Tires have even been replaced with the exact model the vehicle was built with. :) it already has its quirks and it makes me love it even more",Alpina
Nice! But how's the interrior?,Alpina
I just realized I made a build report (in Dutch) https://www.bmwdriversforum.nl/viewtopic.php?t=25404&start=15,Alpina
"Wrong kind of stitching for alpina 
Looks like a stick on badge",Alpina
Not a problem. If you were in the PDX area I'd say bring it to my place and we can tackle it together. Sweat equity discount and all :).,Alpina
Does anybody know who makes the turbochargers for the b3(g20)?,Alpina
"iPhone 14 pro. Probably a dirty lens, although the new LED lights they have in the terminal top parking are very harsh and cause me a lot of glare‚Ä¶",Alpina
If ever there was a car to do that trip in....it would be a Porsche GT1 Strasse of course.  But this would come a close second for me.,Alpina
XB7 can do 180,Alpina
How much longer on importing these to the states?,Alpina
"I know there‚Äôs quite a few in the UK for sale most of the time, but I seem to remember, certainly at one point at least, that the UK used to buy more convertibles than any other European country, which is pretty optimistic, given how much it rains here.

Edit: just to clarify, I mean quite a few by Alpina standards",Alpina
very nice,Alpina
Oh man I think they were nearly 80 per delivered to the West Coast of the US.,Alpina
This car is a September 2007. It's 25 years for import if I remember correctly? So still a few years off yet I'm afraid,Alpina
15-25k Euro,Alpina

"How were washing/toilet facilities? I‚Äôm thinking of going at some point in the future and this is very important.

Also, love the car, big respect for it being a touring.",Alpina
And being able to park next to each other. It was pretty crazy that the spot next to it was open.,Alpina
That‚Äôs a beauty,Alpina
Frankfurt am main,Alpina
"Nice, but better would be to show the car too!",Alpina
That‚Äôs a tough choice. The b6 might take it for me.,Alpina
Awesome! Mooi project,Alpina
I looked at those - I found two manual transmission versions. Very rare. Decided on the Alpina for a more comfortable daily.,Alpina
Sounds like I‚Äôm fucked then.,Alpina
Ooo.. that sounds really nice actually. Could you show me an example?,Alpina
"Yep same here

"Yeah this car should have gone for much more. It was a unique situation. Recent owner was basically given the car from his boss who was the second owner who bought it off lease with 18,000 miles on it. He put 55k on it traveling from Florida to Ohio during the summers.

As we were closing the deal, he explained that he was still making plenty of money from the sale but needed liquid cash quickly as he was trying to close on his new home just down the street from where I live. 

After being out on the lift seems 
Steering rack seals are leaking 
Front left wheel bearing sounds like it might be going 
And there is a slight brake squeak/ rub noise 

Electronically every single thing works besides the rear shade needing a little tap to retract on its own. Think I can just prevent it from fully opening to 100% and it should be able to then retract without help. 

I mean the inside is just gorgeous and impeccable. The buttons aren‚Äôt even worn down on the climate controls ü§Ø",Alpina
"Handy to know about the spare interior parts, though my gear selector knob is in pretty good condition bar some light wear to the leather and I've got the Alpina branded mats already",Alpina
the air valve stem. the spot where you fill the tire up with air. alpina hides theres in the center for a cleaner look.,Alpina

I would love to get on the mailing list for future events! And definitely second the desire for an owners club.,Alpina
Hard to say if it is real,Alpina
"Very cool, well done!",Alpina
"The noise! I miss the noise! Hearing 10 cylinders charge up through the revs was intoxicating! People like to rain on the S85 parade, but I put 60k miles on mine with zero issues. Sold it with just under 100k on original rod bearings.",Alpina
Made these fun little posters to print out and put on my wall and thought I may as well throw them on here :),Alpina
"Driving with your roof down in the rain is character building!

Honestly, I have seen people do that with stuff like Austin-Healeys and MG Bs and the like.",Alpina
It‚Äôs so true. I‚Äôve had 2 M cars before this one (e39 and e60 M5) and this car is just a cut above. Simply fantastic!,Alpina
Do you have a picture of the cover you need?,Alpina
I have an F31 D3 in Mineral Grey with Saddle Brown interior m. Where are you based and would you consider doing another as a commission?,Alpina
thank you very much that would be great they are 21 inch right?,Alpina
"I'm busy with a business sale.  If and when it goes through, I'm ordering an Alpina XB7. I can't wait.",Alpina
I had all my rust done by Peacock Prestige in Coventry. They‚Äôre a really high-end outfit but I wanted the job done right as I‚Äôll be keeping the car forever (hopefully). The wheel arches had been done previously but the paint blend wasn‚Äôt great (although I never noticed until the guys at Peacocks pointed it out) so I had the entire back end done. Looks amazing now. Alpina Blue Metallic too! You‚Äôll have to post some pics of your new acquisition.,Alpina

Still working on making that as nice as the exterior :). It needs a carpet extractor which my shop does not (yet) have.,Alpina
Good lord I want one,Alpina
Looks awesome. I prefer gloss black over chrome,Alpina
Surprised there aren‚Äôt more of us in this sub.,Alpina
Never seen those stripes before.   Sharp!,Alpina

"That looks great! Nice work. Also that last shot putting it into context really threw me off, I didn't realize they were that big.",Alpina
Why's that?,Alpina
In your opinion how much does the alpina tube change the car compared to a regular 3 series,Alpina
Looks awesome!,Alpina
Got any interior pics?,Alpina
I had them painted. My bodyshop guy does it.,Alpina

I appreciate it. I plan on using my daily as well so that's good to hear.,Alpina
Awesome! Where do you get the info on units in north america and color?,Alpina
Stunning!,Alpina
Excellent! Boy does that SUV stand out!,Alpina
"Worked alright in the convertible when you‚Äôre most likely just cruising about with a torquey engine, but yeah, the manual in my B10 is so nice",Alpina
"Working at a bmw store puts you in the perfect place for ownership of this thing. No question I‚Äôd snap it up for $30k. As far as mileage goes, I see 22-23mpg on the highway (ave 80 ish) and high teens around town. I drive les than 10k miles a year so mileage isn‚Äôt a big cost for me. It‚Äôs substantially better than my V10 m5 was‚Ä¶.",Alpina
"Hi there. Thanks for the detailed reply. Yes I did buy the car in the end. It needs some work both mechanically and cosmetically. Currently looking into head gasket replacement, odb scanner reports a possible issue with torque converter although it doesn't drive badly, some normal wear and tear items ( front discs and front shock absorbers ).",Alpina
A sleeper!,Alpina
This is mean af,Alpina
Lots of weight and lots of power being routed to the wheels,Alpina
Centre caps haven‚Äôt corroded üòÇ,Alpina
"Hey, 100k miles or kilometers?

For the most part you can rely on the normal e46 guides which you can find (rust, rear axle etc.)

I would make sure that the service records make sense and that the gearbox had an oil change done (lifetime oil is not really a thing).

Regarding the engines I don't know more failing points than on the normal Bmw engines of this time however I haven't researched them very deep yet. The B3 3.3 engine should be same as in B10 3.3 the B3S 3.4 engine was also used in the Z4 but marketed as 3.3 there (please correct if I'm wrong). So you might find out special problems of them with that information.",Alpina
"Thank you!

I do love the tool marks, but he‚Äôs making me a couple different ones. The next one will be anodized and sandblasted, but with the tool marks on the text retained. 

Gonna have 2 or 3 different ones so I can switch em out if I want lol",Alpina
Been doing research and all the dynamic style alpinas have the valve stem on the rim not behind the cap,Alpina
No. I see valve stems,Alpina
The dynamic wheels just don‚Äôt look good imo.,Alpina

We can't get stripes here in the US, so I may be speaking from FOMO but I say get the stripes and paint the ALPINA in the front bumper to match :-D",Alpina

Awesome pic OP!",Alpina

"Shame we didn‚Äôt get these as a manual in the UK, i think all the right hand drive E46 Alpinas were autos, otherwise I‚Äôd have looked for something similar to this when I was looking at cars.",Alpina
It truly is. Sadly the pics are in a way worse quality than they actually are in on my phone.,Alpina
It is a 2002 B3 3.3. I compared against an M3 but honestly the exclusivity of the Alpina gets me every time. 1 of 38 in the UK and only one of 2 B3 3.3 in this colour in the world. The ride is also a lot smoother in this and much less aggressive in my opinion. Still neck breakingly fast though if it wants to be.,Alpina
Green is the best colour for a Alpina (in my very biased opinion),Alpina
"Get the lowest mileage you can afford and get a warranty.  With the fewest previous owners. You will become friends with the gas attendants at your local station. Also, 2015 had 540 HP and 2016+ models came with 600 HP.",Alpina
