"I have a facelift Insignia B 2.0 Turbo 2WD, the 200 hp one, with the AT9 - fuel consumption at 120-130 is 6.5-7.2 l/100 km (it's in 1500-1800 rpm if you drive on 9th gear). Around 150-160 the RPM is around 2000 and the fuel consumption jumps up to 8.5-9 l/100 km. So far I'm happy with it - solid, reliable, comfortable, very good soundproofing, engine sounds nice when you rev it.

No rust or oil consumption so far (although Opels fixed the rust issue ever since like the 2008 year models and the older 1.8 and 2.0 had an oil consumption issue, but I haven't heard of it from owners of the newer 1.6 Turbo or 2.0 Turbo.)

If you make 330 Nm at 5000 RPM, you get 230 bhp, if you make 330 Nm at 7000 RPM, you get 323 bhp.

I highly recommend camshafts+valvesprings which push the torque powerband up in the RPM range if you want to make power on the stock engine. Mine revs currently to 7600 RPM, bottom end is stock.

ZZP website mentions they are yet to break the stock engine at any HP level.

Ringlands get destroyed by too much boost in the low RPM range combined with fuel with too low octane rating which results in knock and too much heat. Proper tuning is critical here.

Even with the stock calibration, these engines do not really tolerate RON95 fuel.

If you have the tools, remove the ignition coils and check if the spark plugs are swimming in oil as well.

I would have a look from below as well, see how bad it actually is. If you have droplets forming below and/or spark plugs are swimming in oil, if one or both are the case however you need to take action and replace the valve cover gasket.

Old school NA that competes with the one in Ford Mondeo ST and VW Golf R32. I tried R36 Passat and it's just beautiful. But it has to be revved high and then it drinks a lot. So I didn't buy it but got a TDI with optional R36 gearbox and suspension. If driven economically, they are lazy. 3.2 would be a much more enjoyable ride than 1.8 with a fuel consumption to match. And 1.8 is already thirsty on the highway at 150. I had it in Zafira. 14l/100km were a norm on the highway at 150. 3.2 will drink more. I would keep the car as it is and if looking for better performance look for a Corsa D OPC. They are cheap today. And if you want that 3.2, Vectra is now cheap as well. I don't know if there was an Astra Bertone with 3.2. if not, you will have to change the front suspension so it can handle the extra weight. Otherwise it would understeer heavily. It would be better to just get a car that was designed for more power from the start.",opel

"That tracks, my Opel Corsa-e did not come with a cable either, although I did manage to get the dealer to include an original PSA cable in the deal.

Do not get an EVSE (what is often called a home charger but it is not accurate) that is not CE certified and preferably from a reputable brand. Messing with decently high power and continuous loads lead to a lot of heat and it would suck for your house to burn down because you wanted to save a couple hundred euros. Added to that that there might be a risk of insurance not covering, but that would depend on your agreement and local legislation.

I‚Äôd also get a certified cable. Make sure it is capable of the rating of your on-board-charger (OBC). 22 kW cable will cover all possibilities, but Opel does not have a 22 kW OBC so a 11 kW should be fine. If your Mokka-e is 1 phase (up to 7.6 kW) you could also just buy a 1 phase cable which is slightly cheaper, so it will depend on what OBC you have. Make sure you know what you have, your dealer might not know accurately.

Lastly I‚Äôd recommend against using Schuko/ordinary power plug for anything else than short low power sessions. Most installations are not designed for sustained loads at full rated power. Is it because you can‚Äôt do a fixed installation?

"The Signum is basically a slightly shorter Vectra C Wagon. Everything Sontheim same as the Vectra.

The swirl flaps are a small headache with this engine. If they break, Removing them or fixing them into an always max open position might get you small losses in the low rpm end but over all no real issues.

EGR will make problems if the car is moved in cit traffic a lot. But as you already got rid of the DPF, i guess the EGR is the least of your worries and will be removed sooner or later as well.

Other than that, the M32 transmission is a classical culprit for major headaches. They can run fine but they are notoriously unreliable and if they fail, they quickly get hella expensive, though, the repair kits are made to last.

"Well, the CAN-BUS is the communication line between your control units of which you have several. I don‚Äôt know from the top of my head but I‚Äôd assume at least Engine, ABS, Chassis/Body, Comfort and Radio.

If there is a minor damage within that communication line, data gets corrupted and it will throw errors aplenty.

Those corruptions are caused by how data is transmitted. Within the cables the digital data is transmitted by sending a current for a 1 and not sending current for a 0 within a preset amount of time.

If the isolation of multiple lines in very close proximity is damaged for example, water creep could short those and have them transmit current that is out of time and generally wrong, so the Control units can‚Äôt make sense of.

The disappearance can be explained by the cables not permanently being shorted. Could be that they are closely apart and were shorted by vibrations of the road, a pothole, water that disappeared later or something else.",opel

"Usually seat heating is powered through the ignition line and the power would be physically cut once you turn the key back to ignition off even without pulling it.

Could still be some random power draw through a short caused by wetness or maybe animal damage.

If you want to actually test the power creep you‚Äôd need a multimeter and a 10mm nut with a screwdriver adapter.

Loosen the battery minus clamp with the 10mm, but don‚Äôt fully remove it.

Then put some distance between it and the battery pole. (A hand width) and let it sit for about half an hour, that should make the control units power down so that you get a proper reading.

Set the multimeter into DCA / A DC / or A-~ mode depending on model. (A decent one costs about 20‚Ç¨ on Amazon)

Put the red cable to the clamp and and black cable to the battery pole. Anything below 40mA is a good reading.",opel

"Just an update, didn‚Äôt take the intake off yet but as Fuzilla said it seems to be my EVAP purge in my case. You can test it by taking off the hose from the fuel tank and unplugging the electrical connector and leave it connected to the intake manifold.

Look up ‚ÄúGM 1.4 turbo ecotec evap purge valve‚Äù on youtube there‚Äôs loads of videos of people testing them. Just so you know most of them say to take it off altogether and try blow through it. When I tried this originally I could not blow through it, and I only tested it using the manifold vacuum pressure yesterday and noticed it sucking air.

Had a friend come over with jumper cables, car started immediately. Took it for a 30minute drive and after that no issues whatsoever.

The only thing that was strange is that in the days before the battery suddenly draining, the central display didn't show the climate control values in the bottom edge of the screen.
Only the outside temperature and clock showed, but the set inside temperature and climatecontrol status were empty.

After getting a boost, that information suddenly showed up again.
I'm thinking the climate control module errored out and got stuck in a powered on state where it wanted to keep the car warm (it was winter), draining the battery in the proces.
When the battery died, it probably got reset and started to function normally again.

"Pressure and engine capacity don't mean much. Mass air flow is what matters.

If an engine moves 100 g/s of air naturally aspirated, under ideal conditions at 1 bar of boost it would move 200 g/s of air. The K04 is properly matched from the factory for the Astra 2.0 and it can make about 300 hp on that engine at about 1.3 bar of boost.

Going above that pressure ratio makes the compressor inefficient, you get higher boost level, but the temperature also increases and therefore chokes the mass airflow. This is what the turbo compressor map tells you - the maximum you can get from a compressor, anything above that and you either explode the turbo or choke and heat the air so much you lose power.",opel

It didn't change anything physically, other than upgrading it to the Euro 6d-Temp via software. A14NET isn't available in the Adam as it was never delivered under Euro 6 (A is Euro 5, B Euro 6 and D Euro 6d-Temp)

200cell Downpipe+larger intercooler gets you about up 200hp and 320ish Nm. 


What usually breaks is the aluminium piston head from excessive heat. Rods are forged steel. Beyond 200hp the injectors tend to get too small and you will run the risk of leaning out cylinder 4. 


On a stock block with forged internals people have been able to push 306hp with a k04, downpipe, injector upgrade, spark plug upgrade and airbox upgrade (1.7cdti).

Indeed, and I've also been wondering if the one or the other consumer didn't turn off properly once, but then did after the reset  - car is totally fine now, starts no problem even after a full night, battery is clearly full and not being taxed rtn. But something must have drained it down to literally zero over 48 hours last week - that was the longest we left it standing with no use (and no, it wasn't the dome lights, I checked those and they are on a safety timer anyway). I'm wondering for example whether one of the seat heaters that could have been on when parking the car didn't switch off when the key was taken out - that would explain the massive drain.

Another option is the lights in the driver's visor/mirror: the cover broke off, and the lights don't come on as they would when the cover is on and opened. Could that be an issue? Again, the cover is off and the lights simply don't come on as they do on the other side. What speaks against it is that if there were any drain right now, we'd at least notice some weakening of the battery in the morning (yesterday car was left standing from about 15:00 to about 9:00 the next morning, so 18 hours) - but it starts like nothing ever happened.

"Greetings.

You really have to decide what you need. First of all, it's important what you'll do more - city driving or extra-urban driving. If you'll do mostly city driving i.e going to work and back home, the diesel is not recommended. Short distance driving is really bad for a diesel engine. That being said let's go through the list:

1. The 1.7 wins here. It's not some speed demon, but it still performs better than the 1.6 gasoline engine, which feels really underpowered in this model. The 1.7's fuel consumption is in the 5-6 l/100 km range while the 1.6's is more like 6.5-8.5 l/100 km.

2. That being said, the 1.6 is more reliable. It's less stressed and generally there's less that can go wrong in petrol engine. The 1.7 is known to have a heap of issues that were being reported - turbo and fuel injectors being the most costly repairs.

3. The 1.7 is more expensive to maintain. The consumables are almost the same price for both. But the diesel's parts are more expensive. For example the parts for a timing belt change cost about 100$.

4. The diesel engines are becoming a thing of the past with eco regulations slowly killing it - like for example you can't go into certain areas of megapolises with older diesel engines. So the 1.6 is the clear winner here.

5. Generally the better maintained and less used engine would fetch a higher price, so this one is pretty much dependent on the car itself.

Good luck with making a choice and hopefully you find a car that you end up enjoying!",opel
"I may have confused it with other cars with the 1.4 100 hp engine, as my Corsa does have a turbocharger, and it came with 100 hp brand new in 2019.

There's a lot of confusion even from the factory, honestly. Mine is listed as being 1399cc in the papers, which would indicate the naturally aspirated 1.4, but it is not, it is in fact 1364cc.

The naturally aspirated version of the 1.4 lists as a little bit below 74kw or 101 PS.",opel

Sure the 1.7 cdti is more expensive to maintain, but If you drive a lot the fuel savings in comparison to the 1.6 make it the better option. Also the 1.6 has issues with burning oil especially on high mileage cars. 

That can be a expensive repair too. Basically, If you don¬¥t drive much and drive small distances then I would get the 1.6. If you drive long distances and many km per year then I would get the 1.7 cdti",opel
"For the wet belt if I am correct this has been sorted. I don't have experience with this engine, but with older Opel Corsas C and D with 1.2. Anyway for anything running in the oil viscosity of the oil is the key. Change oil regularly and it should be fine. Check my last long comment bellow. If you buy a new one, first 5000 kms don't go over 3/4 of the rev range, change gears regularly if manual, so everything sits in. Change the first oil after 5000 kms.After that drive it in the whole range. Check in the manual at what rev it develops the torque and the range of the best torque.

If not, do the same at all the ECU plugs.

"On the stock 6-Speed manual trans, about 320 to Tops 400Nm iirc. Should be the M32 but I could be wrong, transmissions aren‚Äôt my strong suit. The rods are probably a weak point here as well, someone else wrote 260Nm as the limit for rods but someone else wrote that rods are fine, idk, I‚Äôd always assume something weaker rather than stronger if I am not sure of it. 

If you boost to more than 180HP, I‚Äôd think about improved pistons maybe ceramic coated if you can find some, Mahle is usually a good option if they make those. Maybe stronger piston rings if you‚Äôre at it, rods, etc. especially if you put a bigger turbo on, bigger intercooler might also be a great idea (which you already have as I read.

"Chain rarely breaks honestly. I'm active in my community (Adam/Adam S) with the same engine. Preferably get a B14NEH (pre-2019) as the D14NEH does fulfill higher emission standards, yet this only happens because of software. It's less powerful. No particle filter or better cat or anything. 

What I've heard a lot is:
- loss of coolant through the flange (had it myself) or expansion tank. Easy 20 minute 60‚Ç¨ fix.
-  Coils rotting, depends on age. Feels like older models pre-2017 had this a lot more.
-  rarely waterpumps failing
- The chain sometimes, it's all over the place tbh. Some had it at 60.000km, some never had to have it replaced up until 150k+. Though it starts rattling long before it is gonna go. 

Be weary of the M32 gearbox. If it makes any sounds or the shifting from 1 to 2 is very rough OR the gear stick moves on load changes, its basically fried and need replacement or revision.  I had to have mine replaced after 70.000km, partially covered under extended used car warranty. 

other than that, very solid motor, rarely has any internal issues. 


Cheap and easy fixes to improve your experience:
- Torque Arm in Polyurethane reduces the rough 1>2 gear shift and wobble on load changes by a lot. massive change for me personally.
- shorter throw with an improved shift lever

not so cheap but very important:
- stiffer suspension. Bilstein/Eibach B12 Pro-Kit is very good, otherwise ST X or KW V1

"I own a 1.7 CDTI (Z17DTJ EcoFlex). Average inner city consumption goes between 4-7 liters/100km.

Right after buying it it had issues with the EGR and DPF. The stuck egr was fixed with a hammer and the dpf was fixed with going 3000 rpm on the highway for 50km.",opel
"It's not a question of speed. I went long time ago with a Clio 1.2 all the way to the most south of Italy. And my wife had 2 Corsas with 1.2l running without issues. We talk about long term usage. It's a small block designed for economical driving. It's not meant for fast long distance drives on the autobahn. To drive fast you need to rev it. The temperature of the block and the turbine will rise. Because of the small size, the surface to dissipate heat is small. The  heat will pass to coolant and oil. The higher you rev it, thermal stress will be higher. To keep the high thermal load for long is bad for the longevity of components. Also the viscosity of the oil will degrade fast. So if you want to go fast over long distances and keep the engine in good shape over long run, you get a car like BMW or Audi with 3.0 l engines. Those are designed for autobahn and suffer in the city.  Of course if you plan to change the car after 2 or 3 years, you can drive as fast as you like and pay no attention. If you respect this engine for what it is and drive it accordingly, it will serve you well for many years. It doesn't mean you can't push it from time to time. But to keep the constant speed on the highway for several hours in the range of 120-130. To drive constantly for several hundred kms 160-180/h, for a small block is bad on the long run.",opel

no, internally. No leaks but flow rate. it's 14 years old after all. 

the heat exchanger takes heat from the water loop so it may just take enough away to substitute the reduced cooling.

"If you want to go the Z32SE route, buy a full Vectra C 3.2 and swap everything over. It's not a one to one fit though. You will need to combine the engine mounts from both cars for example. Other than that you will probably need to rewire everything or go for a standalone ECU setup. That's why a full car is basically a necessity and probably way cheaper than all the needed parts separately.

As for the Z18XE, there's only so much you can do. It's easier to do bolt-on mods for it. In my opinion, the performance you can squeeze out will never outweigh the costs. The Z18XE is a tank of an engine but it's not very powerful for the Astra G chassis. It has pretty high compression so forced induction isn't your friend with this engine. It would be more fun to swap the Z18XE into something that weighs way less.

A third option would be to slap in a Z20LEX which will ""just fit"" and it's stock performance almost matches the 3.2. But you'll need to find a Z20 Astra to work with, which will probably already be a coupe considering current prices. So you need to think if that's worth it to keep your current shell or to just swap the car altogether if you find one. This is probably the easiest swap to do and since it's a low compression turbo engine with a huge aftermarket, you can easily achieve more performance.

In  the end everything is possible if you disregard time and money. It's all about what your dream is :)",opel
"If you know who the previous owner was and where the car was licensed you can take a guess, apart from that, no way to be sure but to ask the previous owner.

In Germany you get a Certificate I and II. Number II states who owned the vehicle previously and what the old plate number was sand a stamp with a sigil of the city or village where the plate was verified, from that info you can google the location. If there is something similar where you live,  might be worth to study that.

The emission reduction system is in Europe mandatory for diesels. It has several components such as Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), Diesel Particle Filter (DPF) and Emission reduction injection (AdBlue).

In short, in medium RPM ranges, the exhaust gas gets recirculated to lower combustion temperature which in turn reduces NO2 (nitrous dioxide) emissions which are responsible for acid rain for example. This is done with a valve that can clog up from soot if the car uses the valve a lot for short terms and doesn‚Äôt give it any opportunity to blow out the soot.

The soot particles that aren‚Äôt circulating back through the EGR will then go to the DPF, if the car never gets hot enough the DPF will be full creating an overpressure before the DPF. By regularly driving fast and or high RPM (80-130 kph and between 2500-3000 RPM) the exhaust gas gets so hot that the soot particles will burn and the DPF will be freed from soot.

Then in much more modern vehicles with Euro 6 there is AdBlue injection, AdBlue is basically Urea (chemically synthesized pee) which is injected into the exhaust gas and chemically reacts with the gas to reduce emissions further.

To clarify a few misconceptions, removing all those parts will not increase engine power, it will just remove the possibility of failure if those parts, it will also increase emissions drastically and possibly (depending where you live) be illegal. In Germany for example, taxation for cars is based on CO2 and particle emissions, removing those parts is counted as a crime (tax fraud) and legally removing them is impossible since modifications are not allowed to worsen emission class (euro 6)",opel
