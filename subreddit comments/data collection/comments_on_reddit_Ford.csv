I've been a locksmith for over 5 years and can confirm you will need another master key or a new one made.  Locksmith services will be able to make you a new key for cheaper than a service drive and they will clear it for you if you ask.,Ford
"Was going to say the same thing. You need the top trim on the Bronco Sport to get the 2.0. With that said, it is price comparable to a Platinum or ST Line Elite Escape. The Escape will always have some more luxuries to it but up to op as to which they would want. I wish Ford would promote the Escape more rather than sunset it as planned. It is a great little SUV",Ford

If you want to get technical it’s YOUR fault you bought a POS model from a company. You should have researched that better. There are plenty of other cars from ford and others that would have never required repairs like that.

Transmission shifter cable bushing. There is an open recall to get them replaced.,Ford
I get it. Those issues isn't common aside from a qindow switch. It isn't anything major though so a good service department should be able to diagnose and take care of you in an afternoon if they don't have to wait for parts,Ford
They can sell it. Just cant deliver it or report it sold.,Ford

I get that its not 1970. However ford specifically dropped the 2.0 from the explorer due to being too stressed. I feel the edge suffers from the same long term.  You dont save much gas when you have to floor it too.,Ford

"I'm in the middle of doing this for my '95 7.3 E350 ambulance. The E4OD was shot. I attempted a couple of fixes. After I pulled it out and Put it back in, Didn't fix the problem. I pulled the transmission back out, took it to a shop and asked them to rebuild and put a 4x4 tail shaft in. It ran me about 2300 bucks for the rebuild, they swapped the tail shaft for for free. I also had to buy a new driveline that ran me about $600. I grabbed a transfer case out of a '90s bronco bolted it up drilled a hole for the shifter and I've currently got low gears. 


I bought a '06 super duty front and rear axle for $800. I just need to get the ambulance up in the air, drill some holes for the torsion bar mounting brackets and get the super duty front and rear axle installed. Super duty rims and tires I got from a pick and pull for $300 hopefully I'll have time soon to finish.",Ford
"I would just take it to another dealer to diagnose the window and collision sensors. That most likely is something small, maybe a connection issue. Other then that though, it sounds like the main issue is that you are dealing with is an incompetent service department",Ford

"Larger than stock tires will reduce MPG:
More rolling mass takes more energy to start and keep moving.

I went through with this on my 2015 f250 Superduty 4x4.
I was netting 14-16 with stock 265/65r18 tires.
I went to a set of new dealer takeoffs from a 2019 Superduty f250 275/70r18 and my mileage dropped to 11-12mpg.

I also pull a lot of the time with my truck and average 70-85mph when pulling depending on area of the Midwest.

A couple other items:
Always make sure your tire psi is where it should be.
Wider taller tires will reduce mpg no matter what.

You could look to like Banks for a tuner which can help performance, throttle response etc without voiding a warranty.

Other basics of the joys of V8 F series trucks:
They are designed to work, haul, carry a bed full of stuff. Pull trailers loaded down with that next questionable Facebook market place project vehicle buy of the year *destined to sit on harbor freight jack stands until unloaded on its next potential victim*.

For that ability you have to remember we are talking about 3 tons of steel, glass, plastic, and generally reliably decent transport. 

*Jedi mind trick*
Your F series will never get Honda civic MPG
*** My F series will never get Honda civic MPG***
Your F series can do bitchin’ burnouts if you turn off the nanny BS traction control
***Burnouts, check***

Lastly…

"I get that. I’m 36 years old and a certified diesel and transmission tech, so I’ve been in the mix during this shitshow we call life for a while. I’m not questioning why this happens because I know. 

But, at the end of the day when the service advisor tells me one thing and does another, and makes a point to tell me it’s his best diesel guy working on my truck, practically bragging about how good this guy is, and then this is what I end up with. Well, realistically should I have any confidence at all in their abilities? I say no.",Ford
"Normal in terms of when the vehicle downshifts it slows down. Obviously without knowing your driving habits I can’t 100%, but it sounds normal to be. You could always take it to a dealer, there have been software updates for the trans. Plus below 20 you’re in short gears so the engine turns faster than the trans for faster acceleration. When at highway speeds you’re in tall gears so the trans turns faster than the engine preventing any kind of engine braking",Ford
Just clean the car before you give it back..,Ford
"I wouldn't go directly to Ford to have them look at it.  You can call them and give them the VIN and mileage to find out if you are within warranty.  

I would have another, independent mechanic look at it.  The reason is that they have no incentive to push you over to buy a new vehicle.

I had similar problems with my vehicle a few years back.  It turned out to be a coil - part of the ignition system.  Cost me $150-200 to get fixed.  I am not saying that is what the issue is with your car but it could be something that simple.",Ford
Yeah,Ford
that's not the signal for the engine to start there's a switch attached to the clutch pedal that electronically lets it spin the starter.  How would your engine stay on when the transmission is in neutral if not,Ford
Is it a service reminder light? Maybe they didn’t reset the oil life indicator?,Ford
Hey buddy I do smell,Ford
"If that’s not true then idk what the thousands of customer stories spread across multiple forums are about. I get what you’re saying but with this particular engine if it has made it 30,000+ miles trouble free and just randomly starts misfiring in cylinder 3, it would incredibly rare for it to just be a fuel injector or plug that randomly went bad. Those types of failures would usually happen very quickly or when the part has been fully worn out. The Cam code is weird, but I’m just saying in terms of odds, coolant intrusion of some form is the most likely. I’ve rarely seen newer ford coils and plugs fail. Is it also not suspect that it’s on the cylinder that all the TSB’s reference?",Ford

"That is a horrendous list after 145k miles, and what’s worse is majority of it isn’t even engine related.",Ford
"The fact that you're still financing the truck 7 years later really doesn't play into the equation. If you are going to finance a truck that long, get yourself an extended warranty. 

I can tell you, if you had truly tried to get your truck in, phasers could have been done. Sure, Ford shops have been busy, and there have been some parts backorder, but if you had been on it from 2019 through 2022, they could have gotten you in. I fail to believe this is solely on the dealership for not getting you in for repairs for the phasers, and yet, the truck still drives, doesn't it? Maybe build Ford tough means truck makes a terrible noise for 4 years and OP ignores it and it still drives him to work every day. 

Sunroof is covered 3/36. Why people buy those things I'll never understand - especially on a 84 month finance and no extended warranty. What are you thinking, bud?",Ford

"As noted points can take a bit to show up, but this has been a recent trend with dealers because your points can be redeemed for use on dealer provided services. 

They did this to my dad when he got his Maverick and wasn’t familiar with the FordPass Points system and got him to buy a service contract through them for his oil changes using his FP points. It wasn’t the worst exchange at least but he still got effectively one fewer oil change out of the deal than if he used points to pay for them each visit. 

Sounds like they took your points and are doing something similar. It ensures you get your oil changes from them and they get the full value of your FP points where there’s a risk you go to another dealer or use the points to buy accessories from someone else or an ESP or whatever. 

It’s slimy, which is no surprise. You have 30 days in most cases to cancel the agreement though.",Ford

"I get there's a difference between a warranty and TSB.  I will post here what I posted below too.  I had a 2013 MKZ Hybrid before my current one and it started developing rust on the front doors and I live in FL so that shouldn't have been happening.  I was past Fords at the time Rust warranty but Lincoln stepped in and covered over half the cost to get the doors repaired and repainted.  It was an expensive job still but they offered some kind of relief.  For this they are offering nothing at all, he was even fine with paying for part of it if they would offer some kind of assistance but they are offering 0.  The fact that it's a known issues and he's only 1 month past the original warranty and still under on the miles is frustrating.",Ford

My experience with dodge dealers (I own two chargers) was horrible in my area. The dodges still use the 6 speed trans which doesnt beat the fords 10 speed in fuel economy. I have a neighbor who works on them and said they see a ton of aisin 6 speed failures. The fords had just been redesigned for 2023 and beat the dodge out in available features. I liked the look of the ford better. 

With that said, I have a buddy with a 2018 ram 2500 and he has had very few problems with it, with the only major one being the fuel pump failing. Would I buy a ford again if I did it over again?

why would it be the power train? If there is a engine problem,Ford
"There is a big difference between a seized engine and a misfire.

Seizing an engine is normally done by not maintaining the car, ie running it out of oil, and never changing the oil. This basically destroys the big end bearings and the cam shaft bearings, which effectively destroy the engine 

A misfire is caused by a problem with the fuel or spark a majority of the time. Of course it could be a major like a dropped valve.

If it's a simple misfire only on one cylinder, I'd suggest the coil pack or the fuel injector on that cylinder. Any half decent mechanic can figure that out. Heck they can quickly swap a coil pack to another cylinder and see if the misfire changes to cylinder 2, the same goes for the injector. A DI injector is a bit harder to change over, or they can pull it out and simply test it on a cleaning rig.

No way is a misfire an engine replacement, it's a reasonably easy fix assuming it's spark or fuel related. A simple leak down test would establish if it was more sinister. If it failed a leak down test then your in more trouble, this means that cylinder is not holding pressure. 

Engines are actually fundamentally simple. You just need to understand the basics. Watch some YouTube videos on engines to get a better understanding.",Ford

"I had a 2016 Escape SE with the 1.5T.  Bought it brand new. The car was a lemon. Bad AC system, electrical issues and the cracked block coolant leaked into engine. Needed an engine replacement. I was 1,500 miles out of warranty. I took great care of the vehicle. I put a good amount of highway miles on it. Ford would only give me 1200 dollars toward a new engine replacement. I made a deal with dealership traded it in with a bad engine. I assume they auctioned it off and gave me 8,000 towards a new Subaru Forester. 2019 Forester just hit 100k with no issues. My Ford escape didn’t last more than 3 1/2 years. My first and last Ford I’ll ever own.",Ford

if engine is seized up as the title says... than the first mechanic is right. A new fuel injector won't magically make an engine unseize. Perhaps OP doesn't know what seize means?  Does it turn over and try to start when you turn the key? Then it's not seized up...,Ford

Then roll it all the way up and hold the button for about 5 seconds and it should be programmed. Make sure you are holding the button the whole time it's rolling up and down for the programming. I'm baffled the dealer/tech didn't know that, but maybe there is something else going on. I've fixed that issue about 100% of the time with the steps above, though.

The last one or two sound like a dealer with a lazy/bad tech. I'd go somewhere else next time. 

It honestly just sounds like a poorly run shop with techs who are incompetent.",Ford
First off I'm sorry the dealer told you that's normal because it's not. Secondly under Ford's extended coverage for the clutch you don't need a code. The dealer uses a scan tool and records the clutch shudder as it happens cause typically the shudder will not set a code. Far as if your car is covered under that program i don't know the dealer would know but it sounds like the one you went to unfortunately doesn't wanna help you out.,Ford

Sounds like you’ve had some issues with your truck and that is aggravating. I have what I think is a generally ok dealer, but boy am I glad I know what I am talking about when it comes to service and issues with the truck.

TSB has you pull the plugs and pressure test it over night. Then check for coolant the following morning. I mean the shop could just pull the plug and see if cyl 3 piston is steam cleaned. All the 1.5's I've replaced at my dealership were very obvious when looking with a borescope.,Ford

No, the vehicle won’t die. If it loses fob signal, it will lock itself in park the next time the vehicle goes into park.

"You have an electrical problem.  It will require diagnostics.  It is *probable* there is a wire that's unhappy.  Finding it can be fun.

Go look at some youtube videos from Eric O of South Main Auto, find the ones about electrical concerns and watch how he diagnoses them.  He is a freaking wizard.

These shops you're taking the car to are not doing the proper diagnostics, sad to say, OR they're being extremely (un)lucky in not having the problem when they need to do the testing.

I would *suspect* the immobilizer is unhappy.  I would *suspect* you need to root around on that.  But that is a very VERY uneducated guess from waaay over here.

Get a shop manual.  Unless the immobilizer (and/or other bits) are not stock, in which case you're really kind of on your own.

And if the immobilizer (and/or other bits) are NOT stock, I would banish them from the realm.  Non-Stock stuff makes things harder to diagnose when they can't be found in a shop manual.

"Is it a 2.0L ecoboost?  
[https://www.fordecoboostlawsuit.com/](https://www.fordecoboostlawsuit.com/)

Those engines are all time bombs.

Whatever you do, sell it and buy a Toyoto.

Do not own an Ecoboost Ford that isn't under warranty. The seller most likely cleared the codes and sold it, knowing it had this issue. It's a common issue, I lost my 2.0 at 118,000km (like 80,000 miles). Fortunately, I had the extended warranty and had it replaced, but I certainly won't be keeping it at 240,000...",Ford

"It might be fine, to be honest. I don't know the specifics of your truck, but e85 takes quite a bit more fuel to get to optimum power. Tuning back to 91 octane would mean you need less fuel, so the fuel pressure and/or injector pulse width would get turned down to match.

But... if you're running a smaller than stock compressor pulley, that spins the compressor relatively faster and produces more boost, which would require more fuel again. 

Talk to your tuner. If the previous owner did any mods to the fuel system (bigger injectors, higher pressure fuel pump, etc), that'll all have to be accounted for in the tune anyways. Unless the truck came from the factory as a flex fuel (e85 ready), those mods may be done already and that means you should be good for a smaller pulley. 

&#x200B;

Adding extra info: smaller compressor pulley (the one on the ""snout"" of the supercharger) means that it's spinning faster than a stock setup and will produce more boost. It might be only 1-2psi, but it's still more power for cheap. 

On the flip, a bigger crankshaft pulley will accomplish the same goal. The downside to that, is that now your accessories are all spinning faster too, like the water pump, alternator, AC compressor, etc. It's easier to change than the compressor pulley sometimes, but comes with added wear and parasitic drag from the other accessories.",Ford

"They likely activated it by mistake when trying to reset the oil change reminder, just my guess. You only need one key to activate it, and once its activated it can only be removed by using a master key. All the keys are master keys by default, so if you had the second key (assuming that one wasn't turned into a MyKey as well), you can remove all the stored MyKeys in the vehicle and return them all to master keys. 

Since you said you only have the one key, your only option is to have another key cut and programmed to the vehicle. Even if you had the ability to erase all the keys with a scantool, you still need at least two keys to be programmed back into the vehicle for it to operate. 

The second key is probably still somewhere in the world, and probably still works with your car. So I would recommend to get a new key cut, have all of the keys erased from the vehicle, and have your two keys programmed back in so the other old key/keys will no longer function.",Ford

Unfortunately unless an extended warranty was purchased, ford will not cover any costs. Being a 2019 it’s getting very close to the 5 year mark, and if it’s over 60k miles it will not have any coverage. The shifter cable bushing would have no bearing on the engine issue.

"The P0353 is a bad coil pack and it is *likely* replacing it will fix that number 3 cylinder (the third cylinder back from the front of the truck on the passenger side, unless inline 6 or inline 4, then it's just the third one back.)  However, it could be a wiring issue somewhere else, or a bad engine computer (not as likely, but it does happen.)

You can try to swap a known good (read: any other cylinder's) coil onto 3, and 3's onto the known good cylinder, and see if the code moves.  Say use 2's coil.  Swap 2 and 3 coils, and if the new code is P0352, you know the answer now: Get a new coil.  Or all new coils.  Maybe spark plugs while you're there. 

If the code stays with the cylinder, then you are at the inspection of wiring and/or diagnostics to prove out the engine computer.

The other two codes are related and are probably caused by the same root problem:  Fuel delivery is less than required.  However, there is a problem of the mass air flow sensor if equipped being dirty causing confusion of what the computer should do.  Cleaning the mass air flow is easy enough, use the *correct* cleaner and read the instructions.  It may solve the problem outright.

If it does not, then you are looking into why there isn't enough fuel being delivered, which may be clogged injectors, clogged fuel filter, or a bad fuel pump...

There is also a possible air leak into the system post mass air flow sensor.  You may need to do a smoke test (inject smoke into the intake to see where it escapes), or you can spray some carb cleaner around the intake system to see if idle raises/changes.  If it does, find the leak and repair/replace the affected component.

They do not know what they're talking about.  If there was a TSB or recall it would come up when they scan your door tag at the service department.

"Way too many variables to say your engine should only be burning a specific amount of fuel.

It is common knowledge that fuel mileage ratings are very overinflated compared to the average person. The test is designed to run in very specific conditions obviously to maximize the fuel economy. 

Driving habits, and road conditions are primary factors. Any hills, stop and go, change of speed absolutely KILLS economy.

A basic tune up can help economy. When was the air filter last done? How many miles on spark plugs and coils? I’m not familiar with these engines, but is it flex fuel capable and are you using ethanol fuel such as E60 or E80?

Note it’s virtually impossible to maintain the MPG rating.
My 2018 escape with the 1.5 ecoboost averages about 9-9.5L/100km, but I have gotten it to 7.2.

My 2021 F150 with the 5.0 V8 averages for me about 18.5-19.5L/100km, but it’s a lot of stop and go. I’ve gotten it down to 12L/100km before, but also had it as high as 27L/100km when I’m towing.

Gearing, fuel, driving habits, terrain, altitude, there are tons of factors. If your vehicle is stock height with stock tires, 14-15 on *non winter blend fuel* is going to be the norm. Need to wait until fuel stations are done with winter blend to really evaluate.

Ugh my truck came like this because it was an enterprise rental. You have to have a new key made at the dealer they're the only ones who can program a master key. Cost me $300 😒,Ford
Right however its a warranty and has terms. Thats why they are saying no. If its a recall then they have to fix it for free.,Ford
"It's not a Ford problem, it's an Enterprise problem. I worked for Enterprise before I was an advisor for Chrysler/Dodge. We told people all the time, no pets. Stamped the contract, made them initial, $250 minimum cleaning fee, blah blah blah. I can't tell you how many times we got cars back that we knew had pets in them. Hell, I found a tag for a goat collar in the back of an SUV one time and hair everywhere. We never charged a cleaning fee. They have to be really bad to get hit with that. If you're that worried, just vacuum it out as best as you can and play dumb when you give the car back.",Ford

If they try to hit you with the cleaning fee, just tell them you're not completely satisfied, and they should work with you.

"The 1.5L 3-cyl have only been available since 2018-ish, and only available in America since late 2019. Given it's relatively new and came out just prior to the pandemic (which obviously reduced driving for a lot of people), we honestly don't have a ton of long term reliability data on it yet. There was one major issue related to engine fires that was big news over in Europe where the 1.5L is a much more popular. But Ford has since issued a global recall for that and no major issues since.

I have a 2020 Escape with the 1.5L 3-cyl and it's been flawless so far. I obviously had the recall done for the engine fires, but that's been the only trip to the dealership since I bought it.

When I was originally shopping for the Escape I was more inclined to get the 2.0L 4-cyl engine, just because the 1.5L 3-cyl was brand new at the time. But it would have cost me another $7500 to do so, so I rolled the dice on the 1.5L 3-cyl. And so far so good. Great fuel economy and it's got *substantially* more ""spunk"" to it than the 2.0L Duratec in my 2013 Focus.

I don't have a crystal ball, but not sure it'll be a rock-solid 300,000+ mile engine—just a gut feeling. That said, the reality of the situation is very few people actually keep their vehicles all the way to 300,000. Most upgrade around the 150,000 - 200,000 mark.
