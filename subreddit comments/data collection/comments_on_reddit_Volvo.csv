"I tried the approach of getting the girlfriend to lean stick, it did not go well. 

I wanted another R wagon so that’s part of the reason I made the jump. My 99’ R also has better seats than my C30 did (it was a base model). Just a few. 

I had many nights of being the gentlemen driver in her car too (an automatic civic lol).",Volvo
LETS GOOO,Volvo
"And my 2008 does this, too.",Volvo
"I use it on mountain roads with tight turns and hairpins. It is annoying to have the automating transmission keep the high gear until too late in the turn, you want to downshift earlier so that you have the right gear at the middle point of the turn.",Volvo
Idk 2024 exterior styling blows 2016 out of the water in my opinion!,Volvo
"My total miles left fluctuates depending on my driving. Once, coming down a mountain, I got up to like 900 miles remaining because I was coasting. If I drive in town, the miles remaining drops quickly. On the freeway, often I will accrue positive miles remaining because I am driving more efficiently.

If you want to understand what kind of per tank/per gallon mileage you get, I would set a trip meter when you get gas to see exactly how many miles you are getting between fill ups.",Volvo
Rock star. Thank you very much!,Volvo
Rear quarter panel.,Volvo
Oh dude that’s a sweet ride. Looks really aggressive,Volvo
I did own one at the time,Volvo
"so, about 21 mpg? 

My v70R is less but gets a lot of very short trips. 

On a long road trip, I once got 27.",Volvo
"Subaru’s are great. Handle well in snow and have good active safety. Also reliable. I’ve had an XC90, V60, and currently the XC60 and XC40. But the Subaru I drove back in Park City is always on my mind.",Volvo

That’s a solid deal and the best part is it’s pretty close in spec to the 2024 model.,Volvo
"Yep, will look awesome, but i’ll change the car color also!
Nardo grey wrap will do the job nicely!",Volvo
That is really nice but not this one,Volvo
do they put different scorpions on the plus model? I am not near my car rn so cant tell,Volvo
Thanks so much for the help. You guys have been so responsive. The previous owner told me it helps boost fuel economy and reduces stress on the transmission when shifting up at high speeds. Am I to understand that the automatic does this efficiently on its own?,Volvo
"VIDA/DICE is what you want, it is the actual Volvo system for interfacing with the car's systems. It will give you all of the Volvo specific codes, allow you to adjust various parameters in the car, perform calibrations, etc.",Volvo
"I'm not entirely understanding what you mean by that but i'll relay this to my mechanic, maybe he'll know.",Volvo
"I mean technically this generation and lineup of Volvo’s haven’t really been with us for very long compared to older models. I’m thinking about the P2 S60 was 9 years, gen 3 V70 was 9 years as well, V60 gen 1 was 8 years. And so on. Current models are still pretty new.",Volvo
"Whats quicker, The spyder or the S60?",Volvo
"While the V90CC is very very capable in the snow, tires are probably the most important part of the equation.

I have a V90CC and a P2 V70R, they're both absolutely and insanely good in snow. But i have dedicated winter tires for both. 

If the tire has no traction, doesn't matter how good the car is.",Volvo
"Is this a low profile tyre ? My current xc90 has normal tyres and I get 40,000 miles. My previous was an r design xc90 and it had low profiles. I wouldn’t get those again",Volvo
"I have a 2020 V60, and the interior tech was 2 years behind Audi when it was new. If there haven’t been dramatic improvements since, Volvo is *really* behind.",Volvo
Classic design and sophisticated looking car - I vote keep it that way and original,Volvo
Great work!,Volvo
Yes it was actually,Volvo
I have two coworkers with the same blue wrx that always make a point to park next to each other at work. Similar but much cooler since they are Volvos. ,Volvo
Don't put your warm McDonalds fries there because your car will think that your sensor is broken and it will cost you around 175€ to replace it. Don't ask me how I know that ...,Volvo
And lose control into a crowd of people when leaving a car meet.,Volvo
940 NA redblock gets like 15-20l/100km LPG so it is like 12 euro for 100km,Volvo
What about if you get the battery jumped? Any standard process for that situation?,Volvo
If I’m not mistaken we will be the one of first brand to use lidar so that’s exciting. Looks wise we need something to change,Volvo
"It seems Volvo dealers are grossly over inventory currently, however, I'm not sure the V60 Recharge is significantly impacted.  Are there deals to be had on these?",Volvo
"For some reason I just don't like the back of it, I much prefer the V50.",Volvo
The gauge on my 740 works until 1/2 tank. Then it suddenly drops to 0 and the engine goes rough uphill. Thats my low fuel indicator.,Volvo
"The only fad I see with Volvo right now is that they are in a cost cutting mode where they get rid of a useful button here to move something else to the screen or a useful software options while in transition to Android Automotive.  That and I find vegan leather to be a fad as they wear much faster than real leather, thus negating any positive impact it could have on the environment.",Volvo
"I’m filling up like once every third month or so, i get around 30 MPG mixed driving, 2007 V70 Classic 2.4 N/A 170hp manual.",Volvo
"The Pano roof doesn't steal headroom in the new Volvos. The roof retracts over the top of the car, not into the roof like many other cars so.",Volvo
"These comments make me confident in my recent purchase af a 2009 XC60 T6 with 340.000km on it. It is in the shop at the moment, to have turbo changed, but i am looking forward to having it back. I only got the chance to drive it for 150km before the turbo broke, and i have been waiting almost 3 weeks now, but they have promised i will have it back next week.",Volvo
Ooo that sounds so nice man,Volvo
I have denim blue with blonde interior and yes darker jeans can leave some pigment on the seat but the dealer recommended Lexol cleaner and conditioner off Amazon. Honestly it works fantastic with little to no effort and I agree that I love how light and airy the cabin feels.,Volvo
Anyone able to help?,Volvo
"If you are on a mountain road and want to keep it in a lower gear going down a long hill, it will help you use the brakes less. Also if it is snowy or icy you can start in second to prevent wheelspin, though you might not need that.

Like others said, its the same as an automatic car with PRND21 or PRNDL",Volvo
"You’ve bought halogen, not xenon bulbs.

According to Philips your car should have D1S for the low beam / halvljus.

Edit: Amazon.se is usually the cheapest place to buy xenon bulbs. I’d go with Osram or Philips.",Volvo
2022 S60 B5 AWD. 27.6 MPG over ~15k miles. Fill up 7-9 gallons per week.,Volvo
"Because of how it’s non VVT, I would just repair it with another 850 motor or 94-98 motor. You can use s60 2.4 head if it’s the 2.4 or vice versa a 2.5 from a later s60. Only thing Is that you retain older style pumps and front intake and throttle cable etc. would be about 2-3k but better then a price of another car.",Volvo
"More common than the earlier 5 speed spaceballs, I’ve only ever seen one and pulled from it.",Volvo
"I would get the XC40 in Fjord Blue for my family if we don't already have a minivan. However, it's hard to go back to something with less space than a minivan once you are used to hauling home all the boxes from IKEA. Too bad the EM90 is not sold here in the US!",Volvo
Um my 2023 XC90 has a TPMS…,Volvo
That one is out of budget...,Volvo
Just put it in gear and roll it across the border I’ll put the money in a cannon and shoot it over to you.,Volvo
Xenons use high voltage so be 100% sure you have them turned off while working on them.,Volvo
"OK that makes sense. The main “hydraulic” portion aluminum alloy, maybe save a little weight, cast iron over the rotor, where it would be difficult to an Al alloy and get enough stiffness in a floating open jaw caliper.

Does seem like a fair bit of complication for a floating caliper, probably why all the ATE brakes on the later SPA Volvos, and most cars with floating calipers, are simple single piece of cast iron.",Volvo
I don't think it works on non-electri trunk.,Volvo
Lovely! Welcome. Hope you love it as much as we do.,Volvo
"Having gone through every model since a 240 I can say it doesn't say anything else than I like the design, the safety and the easy power they can make without ever drawing attention.",Volvo
Same in Black!,Volvo
Sure...,Volvo
*nice*,Volvo
"my 850 gets great mileage, just did a 1300km trip on 2 and a quarter tanks",Volvo
Details on that S60?,Volvo
"I think my 40k for my xc40 was about $700.

At least it’s just once a year?",Volvo
"Yet it’s going in for the second time for a headlight malfunction. Probably going to be replacing the headlight for $2200, but that warranty is totally a waste/s",Volvo
Have this on my XC60,Volvo
I definitely hear ya. Good luck on your search!,Volvo
My 23 V60 came with Perelli Zeros stock. Definitely NOT winter tires. I'm in Michigan and plan to replace them with Crossclimate 2s or CrossContact when they're done.,Volvo
"My 2015 S60 can do this with its 8 speed trans. It’s fun to occasionally pedal through the gears manual, but never really practical. Fun though.",Volvo
"Every company is downsizing but Mazda is going completely the other way, which I really like. Big engines will last a lot longer and are more fun to drive.",Volvo
"Ha I hear you but we hear that every year since 2021. And here we are! 

Wagon buyers are a great demographic - rich and loyal. They serve a good purpose for the brand.",Volvo
Pay sales tax at dmv when changing title lien holder in California.,Volvo
Would a 2012 have the aux battery?,Volvo
"I use it daily in commute in the city and on the highway. Roundabouts…. No. It is also unnerving a few times in curves as it will take the middle of the lane when a manual turn will cut the corner of the lane.

I do it in the winter as well but you still have to hold the wheel.

Best use is in the dark, fog, and when your focus needs to be on driving. Sounds kinda weird to say that but it allows me to notice things on the road that normally would have been omitted due to driving tunnel vision.

I can’t speak for how the google based works but both mine are the older sensus system. When the new lidar based ex90 comes out it will be even better.",Volvo
"I know in the US, rare, especially 05+. 
I only know the number for mine, that's 60 imported in 2007",Volvo
"Thanks, everyone!  Got it to snap in.  Just wasn't quite sure how it was oriented....",Volvo
Other way around. We don't have air suspension for example. For the xc90 we only get 2 trims and we can't modify,Volvo
"P3, SPA, and CMA cars NEED TO HAVE THE BMS RESET EVERY TIME A BATTERY IS INSTALLED. I’m saying it in all caps so EVERYONE can see it. They have an electronically controlled alternator that bases the charge level of the battery on how much power it will output to run the car & charge the battery. 

Failure to do so will put excess stress on the battery killing it early, excess stress on the alternator, and eventually burn out part of the ECU requiring it to be replaced or repaired.",Volvo
Just buy a Mustang,Volvo
This ^,Volvo
"Who makes brakes out of steel, it’s cast iron or aluminum alloy.",Volvo
"FCP has batteries, free shipping and the lifetime warranty. Maybe check there. I recently got an AGM battery from them, ruined it over the winter, purchased another from them and then successfully returned the one I ruined and received a full refund. I found my battery buddy.",Volvo

"Danke. Ja ich finde es auch nicht so dramatisch, wollte nur sichergehen. Versiegeln lassen wär aufjedenfall sinnvoll, leichter Anflug von Rost ist auf den Fotos schon zu sehen. 

Der Preis ist wirklich in Ordnung.. Bereifung tausche ich ohnehin.",Volvo
Rip tyre 🙏,Volvo
"There is no adjuster behind the rotor, BUT there is an adjuster at the hand brake lever. Pop up the boot and you can see the 10mm end on it, loosen it a bit and the pads should retract further. Just make sure to adjust the parking brake once it is all back together.",Volvo
"can you elaborate on this statement =)  


I am glad you think this!",Volvo
Yeah. Snowy roads too when you want to maintain a lower gear to save having to use the brakes.,Volvo
The reason I love owning a Volvo is the same reason I would never own a Jeep. I never have to worry about a stranger trying to talk to me about my car.,Volvo

That was just a response to someone. Check my original comment... I explain it in detail and I provide a link to how to adjust the windows to fix it.,Volvo
"Nobody in America bought the S60P, which is still built for other markets. Volvo was selling 15 polestar wagons for every one sedan in the States. I’ve never even seen one in real life.",Volvo
"Sounds like it to me too, picked up a nail or screw and has a slow leak.",Volvo
But In these same cars there is a little button under the gas pedal that does the same thing.,Volvo
Share away! We get it!,Volvo
"I'd check euro ncap scores for safety measurement. Grand cherokee has 81% (adult occupant) for 2011-2022, and 84% for 2022 and later which are not that good in my opinion (you can compare with other models). Afaik, audis and genesis have decent scores.",Volvo
"I thought the steering was very light on my 2020 XC60, but every P2+ I’ve ever owned has been light. When I subscribed to orbit the first thing was enable the settle to change the steering force",Volvo
Who said anything about getting it off the island?,Volvo
"It’s been accurately answered. And no, it isn’t a vent for the infotainment system.",Volvo
"Yeah, Ill try just in case. But dont think it will work, since the c30 physical key has to ber emoved from the fob and its just a piece of metal.",Volvo
"They’re both great, the manual will have you feeling more connected to the car. The auto will be better for convenience, and for sharing if family if needed. 

I had a 2011 C30 T5 6 speed. It was a great car. Just make sure you get one with leather, the non-leather seats crack up really easy.",Volvo

"Old typically equals wise, so you're not wrong.",Volvo
"I fill up every few months and average 65 mpg

Edit - mpg autocorrected to mph ",Volvo
"No. They need to clean the wheel better most likely, and/or apply bead sealer. The ""these are for Jaguar/land Rover"" comment probably is because those are tires that happen to be used as original equipment on them. That doesn't mean that they're only for them.",Volvo
Nothing.,Volvo
"I drive a lot, so I top up something every four days or so.

My Volvo XC-90 V8 averages a consistent 20 mpg. My Volvo V50  T-5 averages 27-28 mpg. My Honda Fit averages 37-40 mpg.

I top up the Honda most often because it has a tiny 10 gallon tank.",Volvo
"I thought so too, for map updates. Though those can be through USB.",Volvo

I originally read this as “ I use it when getting my partner out of the back.”,Volvo
"On all of the cars I've had, the last half tank burns real fast. It's just not right",Volvo
"Yep, note that I said the Volvo was behind in 2020 vs a *2018* Audi (which I owned previously), which had just launched the Virtual Cockpit (which is miles better than what’s in my car). And while the rectangular screen was small and looked bolted on, it did its job spectacularly, and I happen to prefer the wheel to touch. I hate hidden, multi-step touch controls where stuff I need while driving is buried.",Volvo
Hoping it’s just that one bad tyre!,Volvo
Niiice dude a swedish bmw /srs,Volvo
Michigan winters are the reason I bought my first Volvo. Even without winter tires my wife’s wagon dominated UP roads during a blizzard the first year we had it.,Volvo
It is also a reason why some current volvo owners are changing brands. For reference a XC90 lease three years ago was around $600-$800 and today a ultimate is over $1000,Volvo
"So I simply don’t know if it is because it is my first manual car that I have owned. But I have driven every from 14:1 e85 srt8’s, to Tesla Model Y’s and will seriously say this is the number one car I have driven. The Confort/Sport/Advanced are actually different in the feelings and it is definitely not a gimmick. The S60r is the perfect balance of a weekend car and an everyday normal car. But it can be that way because of the 4c suspension. In my opinion, if you would get this car, get the m66. Puts a smile on my face every time a shift in that car",Volvo
Very nice! If only the v40 driver had come later than you..,Volvo
"If Volvo was still making the 242 Turbo, like for real, just kept the line going since say 1991 and only updating the stereo I would have never purchased a different model of car in the last 20 years. (Since I wouldn't have been able to afford one before 2004.)",Volvo
"I drove my mother's brand new Envision with Wireless AA ... And it was excellent. Connects fast. Seamless.   
But still not must have for me and my car.  
All this opinion would probably change if I had an AAOS car and the HUD worked with (in your case) ACP.",Volvo
"When is the transmission service suggested? I've had all the 10k mile services on my new to me purchase, wondering when volvo suggests transmission service",Volvo
"Surprised no one on here can chip in with experience as it’s such an infamous issue. Keep us
posted. I don’t have a pano but I know someone who has the issue with an XC40. He’s not managed to get it fixed but also worth noting that we share the same local Volvo franchise dealer and they are complete fuckwits. If it were me, I’d be making full use of whatever purchase / warranty protection you get based on your location.",Volvo
"Not sure why your comment got downvoted.  I have it on my XC90 B6 and this is exactly what I think of when I select this mode.  I also used to have a Mazda and felt that the function was very much the same.  Granted I do a lot of city driving, so perhaps that’s not the best use for it but you’d think it would be useful in all kinds of driving settings for what you’re paying.",Volvo
Thank you👏🏽🇸🇪,Volvo
We get around 10-20 a year with and additional 5 polestar v60’s sold. They are dying,Volvo
"I cant agree with you on that. The new system is far better than the last, yes it has its downs but the upside is far greater. It came out in 2021 and has improved a lot since its release.",Volvo
"From my understanding theres nothing to much thats different internal, maybe some trim pieces.
I think its just mainly the engine and awd that thats different but I could be wrong!",Volvo
Volvo obviously put the focus on the new EV line. Hopefully we will see them start to back port the tech and features to the current models. I drive a v60 CC and have an XC90 as a loaner right now and have no desire whatsoever to drive a car this big full time. It’s not fun to drive and is no more comfortable or more utilitarian than my wagon.,Volvo

Thanks for the answer! Ahh Orrefors gear shifter is s very cool touch! I have some Orrefors drinking glasses at home! But yeah older inscription packages was always amazing but i felt like newer versions lost some of this luxury touch but it seems i was wrong wich im happy about haha,Volvo
"I loved the 20” Pirelli Scorpions on my 2016 XC60 T6. They only lasted four summers though - about 50,000 km. I just went to order replacements and decided not to. They were too expensive.  Instead I ordered Continental Supercontact DWS06+ for about a hunski CAD per tire less and there is a rebate on right now.

That will give me 18” X-Ice for the winter and the DWS06+ for the summers.",Volvo
You know Volvo sells a lot of cool shit. This one is way cooler: https://www.volvocollection.com/volvoconsumers/Stoneware-Mug-Blue/p-CMG08955,Volvo
"Yeah, it's a rare bird nowadays ... dumb Americans and their SUVs.

Counterpoint, cars in general have become pretty reliable. As someone else pointed out for their V90, it was a ton of annoyances and nothing that kept the car from going from point A to point B. Sure, Volvo is closer to the bottom of popular reliability rankings, but that doesn't make the cars UNRELIABLE.",Volvo
Congrats! Good choice.,Volvo

I can’t go with a Beamer since I prefer use my turn signals. GLC and E450 aren’t bad and just started looking at those,Volvo
"A) not true B) just rude

"Tire warranty itself is a good idea if you live in an area with potholes or high construction traffic (ask me how I know). However, special tires are a sales gimmick. These tires can be purchased anywhere, nothing is exclusive about them. Doesn’t mean that Volvo specification uses cheap tires though. The usual range for a ‘same branded’ Volvo tire is $150-$275 each. If you have Pirelli tires, definitely get some kind of tire replacement warranty.",Volvo
">I took it to the dealership thinking it would be covered under the warranty but they said we needed a maintenance contract.

Warranty never covers maintenance so that's nothing weird.

But that seems excessive. I'd take it to a different volvo mech for a second quote.",Volvo
"I book every Saturday of the season at a motel up there

c30 doesn’t scream luxury - c30 owner,Volvo

"I am in a very similar situation 

XC90 is a dream car for me, and I’ve been wanting an up grade from my forester for a while now. 

But, my family is young and I don’t know that the kids are ready to respect a Volvo the way it deserves.  

I am leaning towards a CX90 as a compromise.  Relative space (3 rows), but lacks the luxury sheen that would come with a Volvo and contradict the constant muddy boots and endless snacks in the back seat.",Volvo
The fwd t5 is snappy. Close to a 6 second 0-60,Volvo
Higher HP? You mean horse power?,Volvo
You can however lease it for 3 months and get a good portion of that as a discount. A incentive loophole,Volvo
"I just purchased an XC60 T6 from 2009 with 340.000km on it. Straight of the lot, the fucking turbo died... I am having it fixed, as it did not make sense to scrap it already or sell it for parts. The mechanic is overall impressed with state of the car. If they er maintained well, they run forever. You can often find these cars en DK with 450-550.000km on them. 
Keep in mind, that the registration tax is 180% in DK, meaning that it more often makes economical sense to repair, than you are used to en UK or US.",Volvo

Welp, shiiiit",Volvo
"I find the steering light for my tastes even with it set to firmer it's not like traditional power steering (it's electric), but it really corners well for something of the size. There also isn't any slop and The steering ratio is decent. The thing isn't a sports car, but it definitely handles better than a lot of other similar SUVs",Volvo
If you’ve got the OEM tow pack the transmission knows there’s a trailer and adjusts accordingly . Admittedly it doesn’t know the exact weight. My old V70 had the shift points move when the towing electrics were in use.,Volvo

"I can't comment on this particular case, but sometimes there's no choice.  I caught a tyre on something near the edge of the road a few years ago and felt the rear tyre go down.  It was a fast and twisty single carriageway with nowhere to pull off the road, and it was dark.  It would have been *very* dangerous to stop, so I had to keep driving for about 4 miles until there was somewhere safe to stop and put the spare on.  Of course I slowed down and put my hazard lights on, but stopping would almost certainly have caused a major accident.

Fortunately the tyre remained largely intact and on the rim, so the wheel was undamaged and it only cost me a new tyre.",Volvo
"I’m probably going to buy the extended warranty here soon. They said it’s pro-rated and at $5k for 5yr, I think it’s a fair idea as I only plan on having the car for maybe a year or two. So an extra $1-2k for peace of mind is a no brainer.",Volvo

Actually, they can still be useful in certain situations.  If you need to pass someone on a 2 lane country road, you can downshift a gear or two ahead of the pass so acceleration is instant, verses waiting for the trans to kick down.",Volvo

"The range estimate heavily favors driving efficiency of your recent or current drives and not historicals. So if you're driving one direction, not hitting lights, or being really easy on the gas, the estimate will increase. If in the opposite direction you happen to hit every light, or accelerate harder, it'll drop. Could even be that one direction of your drive is primarily downhill and the return is uphill.

"Makes sense, thanks! Glad to hear it worked for your girlfriend.",Volvo
"There is a theory that if you are going to use it, you shift into manual mode from a stop then manually shift gears from there, as opposed to shifting in and out manual mode when downshifting is required. The theory goes that this protects the transmission, though I am not sure if this is true. And I have never experienced issues going in and out of manual mode. 

That said, you'd want to use it to downshift for a passing maneuver or on winding roads. Generally speaking, if you are not accustomed to driving a true manual, the concepts won't make that much sense and since the automatic will downshift/upshift to match speed you are fine leaving it alone.",Volvo

"Edit: made it clearer that the P80 C70 is unusual in NOT electrically raising/lowering the window when opening and closing the door.

The P80 C70s didn't do this... At least not electronically. It's unusual- most European convertibles/coupes with frameless door windows do have the electrical setup that lowers the window a few mm when you open the door and then raises it again when you close it. The guy that told you that is likely assuming that your car is like other European cars/  the second generation C70. The design of the window mechanism on the P80 C70 (98-04) is such that the window should be canted inward a little bit when the door is open. When you close the door, the window is pushed outwards, which also causes it to move up slightly. Over time, the weatherstrip compresses and the window lift mechanism (called a window regulator) ""decompresses"" from wear. When this happens, you'll get leaks. However, it can be adjusted. The adjustment is a bit fiddly and can take a few tries. [Here's a link to the adjustment procedure](https://charm.li/Volvo/2000/C70%20Convertible%20L5-2.3L%20Turbo%20VIN%2053%20B5234T3/Repair%20and%20Diagnosis/Windows%20and%20Glass/Windows/Adjustments/Window%20Front%20Side%20Door%2C%20Adjusting/)

I actually thought long and hard about this. I can't come across too flashy or too successful for my work. The reason for that has to do with the type of work and the culture in my country.
Volvos are considered to be a sensible decision. A new one says that you have your stuff on track but you're not a shouty person.

When getting my car I looked at lots of cars (all station wagons) seriously. From the Passat and the V60 at the low end to the V90, E Class and 5 Series at the high end.
I was going to take a full options Passat but they didn't sell that with four wheel drive in my country at that time so I went for a full options V60.

"Of course, but the argument with engine braking not locking up wheels is just that it doesn't add that much friction. Similarly, one can just press the brake pedal lightly and achieve the same effect, but with more control over how much.

Engine braking doesn't provide constant drag, I mean yes, it will if you are downhill and keeping your current speed with engine braking, but if you're on flat ground and engine braking the effect will get lower and lower as the engine RPM reduces.

Brake fading is really only a problem if you're braking heavily for long periods of time, such as going downhill or on mountain roads, but this situation has nothing to do with slippery roads and I absolutely recommend using engine breaking on these roads. P3 Volvos even have a handy button to automatically keep your current speed using engine braking (similar to trucks)",Volvo

"To be honest not sure, we never did one at the dealership, i suspect due to cost. it’s an Asin transmission unit though, when it comes to transmission I tend to follow the transmission manufacturer guidelines instead of the brands. especially after that bmw life time fluid bs while the manufacturer ZF said it should be done every 75k.  On most transmissions that aren’t CVT the fluid and filter is due at 75k",Volvo
"I wish I had not chosen Michelin cross climate tires - they get good reviews, but after 25k and 2 rebalances (with hunter road force yada) they still hum like crazy.

"Yeah, there should be drive modes via a dial next to the start knob.  You can also change individual drive settings (steering, accel, braking) to your liking and save the settings to a profile.

I agree with you the default comfort steering is way too loosey goosey.  The firm setting is better, but yeah, it's never gonna be as good as a sportier car.  I miss the driving dynamics of my previous Audi, but appreciate the comfort in the Volvo as I get older.",Volvo
The wheels wil get replaced with 17 inch Tethys and its a jap style exhaust so that makes sense,Volvo
"I've driven a lot of manuals. And aside from the fact mine got messed up a bit so getting into 1st or reverse can be a pain at times, it shifts amazingly and is much more enjoyable for me to drive being a 6 speed. If it were my daily car I'd prefer an auto since there's many hills and traffic around me but it's not so it is worth it to me and I got lucky finding it when I wasn't even really looking for a c30. So glad I did and I don't plan on getting rid of it anytime soon. I did lowering springs, rear sway bar and a few power adders, the most noticeable being the tune after doing intake spacer, boost pipe, intercooler and exhaust dump. Really woke it up and second gear is a riot with the torque steer and wanting to break traction even with sticky oversized tires. My vote would be to get the manual if you really want to enjoy the car but if not, the auto under 90k wouldn't be terrible, just won't be slaying the GTI crowd.",Volvo

I use it when I'm having a bit of fun driving fast. Automatic transmissions are typically setup for fuel efficiency with reasonable performance. That's great 99% of the time. If I'm really hauling ass down a windy mountain road the car is normally not making the best choices gear wise for what I'm trying to do. That's when manual mode is useful.,Volvo
"I do want to mention if these are OEM tires that came with the vehicle, manufactures ship them with the softest rubber available for the softest ride quality.

"Damn, thanks.",Volvo
"I own a 2012 d3 c30 auto,17000 km, it’s good, smooth with a manual mode that works great, still shifts smooth and reasonably fast, (~1-2 seconds) but it will shift for you to prevent stalling or rpm that could damage the engine",Volvo
"Too cheap, double the price. 
At that price, people want a cheap run around, with easy to source, cheap parts. They’ll think it’s falling apart at that price.

"They can call it whatever they'd like, but it measures spin, not tire pressure, so it's not a tire pressure monitor anymore than the Democratic Republic of North Korea is a democratic country.",Volvo
"Lack of wireless CarPlay makes no sense at this price point. I also wish the scheduled auto heating could run without a PHEV charge…

Other annoying design choices are lack of physical temperature knobs, no rear temp control in the xc60 and the glove compartment storage in front of the passenger seat makes it uncomfortable to sit for larger people.",Volvo

"I would love to hear an update on this if you proceed with it. I posted a similar question the other day but still dont have any concrete answers. My dealer gave me the monthly lease payments and the residual price to purchase the car, so i couldn’t figure out if i had to pay the 24 lease payments plus the residual when i buy it out. I was also told that audi “requires” 3 months of lease payments, and the discount off MSRP was $11,000 at one dealership and $10,500 at another, based on comments above it sounds like we could get more off.",Volvo
"😂 it's on the page you linked.. 

""System description
The tyre pressure monitoring system measures differences in rotation speed between the different wheels via the ABS system in order to be able to determine whether they have the correct tyre pressure. If the tyre pressure is too low, the tyre's diameter is changed and, as a result, so is its rotation speed. By comparing the tyres with each other the system can determine whether one or more tyres have pressure that is too low.""",Volvo

Around 24 mpg  is what I get,Volvo
"Yes, I have a mini electric air compressor with a pressure gauge I carry in the car",Volvo
"It has to do with the BMS system that monitors how good the battery is, you have to tell it you put a new battery in or it assumes you still have an old battery and doesn’t overcharge it just in case. So you’ll get “low battery” warning a lot more often even though the battery is brand new and healthy.

Top comment has more info on resetting BMS without VIDA or scan tool. Only reset with new or new-ish batteries, it could cause damage to battery or vehicle systems otherwise.",Volvo

"For the first time since 1990 I purchased a car that wasn’t a Volvo.  My wife has a 2019 XC90 T5 and I had a 2011 C70.  My wife wouldn’t let me take her car to Home Depot and let’s just say the C70 is not a Home Depot car.  

So I wanted a wagon and thought about the V60 CC. But it was so similar to the XC90 and expensive. Also very luxurious and also not a Home Depot run car.  


So I opted instead did a 2024 Subaru Outback Onyx XT (2.4L turbo) instead for about $40,000 USD out the door.  Really like the ride height like an SUV and the lower roof line of a wagon.  Plus it rides great too.  

Let’s see if I get 13 years out of the Outback or me too as I will be 80 at that point!

Rust is always my concern with non-Volvos too.

No. Black wheels have become a cliché. The car stands out more as is.,Volvo
T5 plus a paint job might save a little more money in the long run! (Why is silver so boring? I have had white and grey cars and think silver is boring hahah.),Volvo
"Either for off-road/incliment weather or a windy country road where perhaps you want to use a bit of engine braking/enter into a corner at a certain gear for power delivery on the exit.

My V60 has a newer gearbox but still the manual option. I usually use it for caning it on sporty roads and a bit of engine braking etc.",Volvo
Dude talked totally random :D Obv knew shit about cars,Volvo
Good to know. I’ve been saying “t8 recharge” which I now know is redundant.,Volvo
Quarter panels are replaceable panels. If one is damaged too much that it can't be repaired it is cut out and a new one installed. A whole unibody car is just panels welded on top of other panels. You can pretty much replace any panel or section with a few non-serviceable specific parts as an exception.,Volvo
You really like Sweden I see.,Volvo
"It’s people who don’t get that combined mpg != mpg. They just see a number and keep repeating it. I have a PHEV, and no matter what you say some people are convinced the official fuel economy numbers are wrong and they are actually getting 50mpg",Volvo
Just seen this I got you!,Volvo
I replace 50 support batteries for every one main battery on these cars.,Volvo
"Icy roads, not so much. But if you are in deep snow, manual is the way to go. Auto trans has the drive wheel spinning even with brakes on. It just makes ice and digs you in deeper when stuck. Manual gives the ability to easily rock the vehicle back and forth to make ""ramps"" in the snow to get out. I would always buy a manual over auto if it were available.",Volvo
"No, it's still a TPMS. If it weren't a TPMS, then the car wouldn't meet the federal vehicle standards and wouldn't be avaliable for sale. While it's not the type of TPMS you are referring to, it is a TPMS.",Volvo

"I have two available - MSRP minus any incentives you may qualify for. If interested, reach out.",Volvo
Yes they did move up/down a few millimeters to allow the doors to close safely.,Volvo
It passed the Moose test,Volvo
I don’t care your reliability.  Stop acting like your specific case is the same everybody else has. $2k is not a big deal to have complete coverage for 2 years.,Volvo

I don’t think I’ve ever touched that button in the 3+ years I’ve driven our 2020.,Volvo
It is a thing of amazing taste and beauty.,Volvo
im surpsied people are saying it will be better than my jeep. It also makes me happy haha. I thought the jeep would be better in the snow.,Volvo
That thing looks a lot more sporty than it has any right to be,Volvo
"Yes and no, you can't play Spotify while an Android phone is trying to emulate a USB stick, since the car is looking for MP3 and other audio files.

iPod support in cars however is just plain music streaming from the device, so that means you can play any media you want from that phone.

In this case OP wants to stream podcasts from Spotify via USB, something Android cannot do (It can obviously use an USB to 3.5mm jack cable, but depending on model year the car will not have an AUX jack)",Volvo
Yea I feel like people are too over reliant on technology for this stuff.  Especially when you are about to start a road trip.  I guess since I drove a “low tech” car for so long I always check the tire pressure and at least visually check for an obvious low tire.,Volvo
Guess they removed it. There is a digital temperature setting for the rear area that the passengers can change...,Volvo
"Inscription was supposed to be the most luxurious. Well the biggest noticeable differences would be dashboard decor, glossy black display surrounding and biggest difference would be the leather seats and orrefors crystal gear shifter in hoghest interior version.",Volvo
"Nice, glad someone has the same experience. I try to do the same.  Advanced and manual once a week for some fun keeps it running nice. When I get lazy and boring for a minute, I can tell. Shifts slower, and earlier. A little fun sets it right.",Volvo
Do  v60cc. You sit higher and it’s not that far off from the XC60 in terms of ride height,Volvo
They do make sleeve kits however you lose displacement and it’s still an aluminum block.,Volvo
with an optional package it would notify the trunk monkey,Volvo
You bet 😂,Volvo
Work on navigating between the lines first! /s,Volvo
Def about to put out a salt lick,Volvo
"Yeah, but don’t love the look as much as also quite pricey",Volvo
"There's facelift and prefacelift, my 2009 is automatic and I still find it enjoyable to drive even at 160k miles. It's also different having it as my second car and my first is manual.",Volvo
"I cannot stress how many cars I get where there’s a concern for a one time occurrence like a blis or a sensor issue, literally cannot recreate them and it’s a fucking waste of time",Volvo
Yeah the more advanced they try to go the more little genuinely helpful things they lose.,Volvo
"Your wallet, probably.  Anything is possible with enough money.

You might try asking the Ford guys, a Focus ST is a lot more likely to see these kinds of mods.",Volvo
Congrats! Hope you love it,Volvo
"It doesn't allow more than that, probably only exhaust. Got any action shots?",Volvo
In my experience the manual shifting is very slow. I’d just use the automatic since thats what its made for,Volvo
Same. I shopped around a few dealers in my area and saved $250 or so. But $750 is about right.,Volvo
"Dang! Is it just because everyone is buying SUVs nowadays?

I sat in a new s60 and it was just way too small. I drove a 2015.5 on a test drive previously and I don't remember it being that tiny.",Volvo

So if your looking at builds for the 2.5T engine it won’t be for the engine you have.,Volvo
"My S60 D5 2003 needs 40mpg (5.8l/100km), filling 2 times per month",Volvo
Saab is dead.  You chose a terrible example.,Volvo
Always wanted those blue and silver gauges,Volvo
DM me the links and I'll check them out,Volvo
Wouldn’t be surprised at all if it had a super clean and shiny engine bay with some serious swap.,Volvo
But I bought another mustang yesterday if you wanna see it,Volvo
"I will never ever in my life ever again ever own another Hyundai. Worst vehicle I ever owned. My former Subaru had 230,000 miles and never left me stranded. That stupid thing had me on the side of the road at 23,000 miles. Multiple times. It just never worked. 

It's more utilitarian but give Subaru a spin. They're fun, safe and super reliable. I hit a deer doing 70 and didn't spill my coffee.",Volvo
10/10 recommended🙈,Volvo
Its time for a new tire,Volvo
Someone has likely fiddled with the odometer.,Volvo
"Yeah no. The rotor takes ~90% of the heat energy in brakes. The pad is an insulator, and barely contacts the bracket, no good opportunity for conduction. There is no benefit to extra mass for heat capacity in the caliper or bracket, the competent engineer would put the required mass into the rotor.

Now I’m not that familiar with those particular brakes, I know SPA. Are those brackets aluminum alloy? I assumed they might be, using Al alloy would require more material than typical cast iron for a brake bracket. They look similar to the Audi floating caliper brakes that use Al brackets, mfr’d by ATE, the usual Volvo brake supplier.",Volvo
"For those wondering how it got there, the area around Chicago was *heavily* strip mined. This lake is man made, because when the strip mining is done, they simply stop pumping out rain and ground water, and the mine fills up. The ""island"" that the Volvo sits on was once a peninsula in that lake, and the people who left it there excavated the peninsula down below the water level. If you Google Earth view it, you can see the remains of the peninsula below the water.",Volvo
About twice a month on a 15 S60. I get about 330 miles a fill up,Volvo
"https://engineered.polestar.com/au/model-selector/   
That gives exact numbers. Honestly I believe it's only worth it on the lower trims (T4, T5). And only then, maybe.  
I have it on my pre owned T6 and I never use it. It's pretty much the equivalent of ""Sport Mode"" on lesser vehicles.   
It does feel faster in that mode but it's also holding gears longer.... Reminds me very much of Sport Mode on my Mazda.",Volvo
I wish there was a hardware button to turn the cameras on!  It is so frustrating to try to go through the menus when the car first starts and the system is unresponsive!,Volvo
Pretty decent roads going to and back from work. Definitely not planning on talking her off roading that’s for sure😂,Volvo
A Wheel can handle WAY WAY WAY more abuse than this. This is 100% cosmetic,Volvo
"VAG and BMW is are fine tbh, you just need to be willing to work on your own car or go to an Indy rather than a high-price dealer.",Volvo
"Yes they do, so The Windows can seal properly",Volvo
T5 (and don't laugh at me! it's FWD).,Volvo
Yeah the windows are tinted for my car,Volvo
"I’m confused your sales are up. You have a demo with the new mirror kit. What’s the problem, from that perspective. 

I’ll agree the looks are consistent. Personally that’s a good thing, wouldn’t say Volvo is being left behind. It’s just being less fad orientated. 

That said, there is nothing to tempt me out my 2019 V60. It’s fast enough very well appointed and looks amazing. While I’d like a hybrid, purely to get a better gearbox. My D4 is doing just fine, plus the prices are insane compared to 5 years ago.",Volvo
"You should be able to active it with orbit. Pretty sure all mild hybrid models have the vacuum-less brake booster, so they are ready for ACC & PA from the factory.",Volvo
"It’s mostly a joke. I’m watching “The Mindhunter” right now, so maybe I was influenced by that.",Volvo
Andrew.,Volvo
"Yes, this was my initial calculation as well, but based on what I’ve read up on this, you also deduct the “rent” or interest on the outstanding payments. I need to actual contract to get the verbiage on this and to see what the “interest” portion of the monthly payment would be. Immediate lease buyout seems to be a trending strategy across phevs to take advantage of the incentive, it’s just hard to find concrete info.",Volvo
i had it listed for 3.5 no interest whatsoever. got 1 message in a month,Volvo
"It looks great! Hopefully you can run a few thousand miles before those Swedish Gremlins pop up. 

I’ve spent a lot on mine. No regrets.",Volvo
"Have you measured the thread depth yourself? Did they comment anything on uneven wear or just excessive wear?

The rear motor being electric does come with the issue of the rear wheels being exposed to higher torque. So it's easier for them to slip a little bit, but not enough for you to notice necessarily.

I'd check with a GOOD tyre tech and get a second opintion.",Volvo
"Youll have to go 2.3 or 2.4 to get that much, the 2.5 has such thin cylinder walls",Volvo
"Our trip meter reset recently (maybe as part of the last OTA, not sure). It's currently saying our average is 2348.6 mpg. I have some doubts, haha.",Volvo
You should definitely check the drainage from the panroof. This should be most likely the problem.,Volvo
"Literally just dropped off our XC60 for the 40K work. The price is $720 after a 10% off coupon from the dealer site. It’s a lot of money, but we didn’t purchase a Volvo with the expectation that service would be cheap.",Volvo
Can you take the fob apart and see if it’s just dirty inside? I have an older fob that periodically needs a disassembly and cleaning of the contacts.,Volvo
"Volvo used to give an orange key to be a teenager/valet key that limited speed and functionality. It no longer does this but people, like you, kind of liked the orange so they give you an orange regular key now.",Volvo
How much and how many miles? Momentum?,Volvo
SPA.,Volvo
"If you are willing to, you should probably do it. I let mine for a bit too long and I had to change cam seals, oil cooler seals and the pcv breather.",Volvo
"Well if you ever need another I plan to start picking them up, I find them around me here in Texas for around 3000$ usually under 140,000 miles too!",Volvo
"No. Because I GUARANTEE YOU that they did not buy it or could show a receipt for it.

And people tend to always remember what they want to hear. It's more likely the OP is/was a idiot.",Volvo
If you're only keeping the car a year or 2 that's a bad deal. Wasting your 💰. T5 with 30k? You're not going to have problems with that.,Volvo

"2023 XC90 B6. Filling up maybe every two weeks, and it really depends on the driving. Get maybe 18-19mpg in the city, but often 30-31mpg on the highway.",Volvo
Needs massaging and ventilated seats though. I'd be game for your unicorn if it came with better seats.,Volvo
On these old radios they are meant for USB Flash Drives where you put mp3 files on. You cannot a plug a phone into these as the protocol between the phone and the radio is not supported.,Volvo
"You have a bad in-tank pump, and possibly sender",Volvo
Why not x3 or a glc?,Volvo
"Is LIN communication. I popped the filler “button” off and compared it to the hazard button. Basically the only difference was there was a little nub on the back end of the hazard button to make it longer so it could press the actual button on the module and a tiny block on the side to stop it from moving in and out. I added a thick piece of hot to the filler and dremmeled the block off. If you remove the hazard button and compare it with the filler you’ll see what I’m talking about. Once I had enabled the LIN connection on the CSM it allows me to change the drive mode. Sounds convoluted when I explain it but it was pretty easy. It took about 5 minutes total to do. It was a low budget way to enable drive modes. I can’t find the part number for the drive mode button itself so this will have to do. 

https://i.imgur.com/ihHmlmH.jpeg",Volvo
In regards to the S60 and V60 I've been told for the last three years from Volvo corporate members that this will be the last year so in my mind if sales keep steady they may keep them. My dealer gets a lot of V60 Polestars (We have two currently) and they sell very quickly so its hard to tell if they will stop. We need change soon to compete.,Volvo
"Yeah, I have all Elevate parts with a stage 2. Sleeving the block could let me get past 400, no?",Volvo

It has rear air vents but you can’t change the temperature separately for the rear passengers. I have the 2023 recharge ultimate,Volvo
"Got a MY09 T5 manual, it's getting expensive to maintain and currently need a new engine (still looking after 4 months) but after a lot of soul searching, I just need to fix her. Manuals of this age are so rare, and just such a joy to drive. NSW, Australia.",Volvo

"A 55L tank will last me nearly 2 weeks. I’m getting 50-60(UK)mpg on mixed rural tight roads and motorways. If I was to commute to work only using the main roads/ motorways it’d be a +70mpg commute

Driving low displacement diesel does have its perks ;)",Volvo
"Read my top comment. It's too late to fully reset the BMS, but you should reset the state of charge. It's very easy to do on your own, and it will take care of the problem.",Volvo
I've got a 2018 V90CC that I just don't see any value in upgrading to something newer.  Everthing in the car is good enough that I can't imagine getting into a new car and loan unless I was looking to get a plug in hybrid. And that's a stretch based on the price and interest rates right now.,Volvo
You haven’t said where in the world but yes an S60 with those specific specs will not exist in a substantial amount.,Volvo

A classic beauty that has withstood the test of tim👍,Volvo
"Why is the gas mileage so bad on these new Volvos? My wife gets 20-22mpg weather dependent on 21 xc90 t5, and drives like a nun. My 2021 audi SQ5 gets 29mpg and I drive like it's a rental.",Volvo
"Yeah, I got excited and just assumed it was the Volvo Exterior Styling Kit lol. I’ve been looking for the last 30 minutes and can’t seem to find it either.  I’m seeing that style for the S60 and some S90s for sale with it, so it’s got to exist out there! I’ll let you know if I end up finding anything!",Volvo
Wasn't there a post with a similar situation yesterday? Trend or coincidence?,Volvo
Thems 20s?,Volvo
Everyone is broke,Volvo
"Grew up driving only a stick. Was taught that you never panic brake in ice or snow if possible.  Now have an AWD XC60.  If I see something ahead that makes me think I should slow but not panic, I have always just down shifted and use the engine to slow me a little.  In the VO, I pop the handle over and down one.  The 4 tires all grab but don’t overbrake.  This is all IMHO of course. I don’t have an F1 license nor am I a Rocket Surgeon. This is just my comfort zone…",Volvo
"Normal modes - we rarely change unless you want to drive in Eco mode or Off Road. With a Polestar Optimization, those that love sport tuned (and an extra 40 horsepower) suspension, steering and shift-map, and I do, switch often into Polestar, even for a quick grocery run. It is done without taking your eyes off the road, and done while driving most of the time.

But the newer models - no.",Volvo
When maximum swedeness is detected the vehicle releases a kanelbullar scent through the HVAC system,Volvo
"I agree about the tank. I know it’s easier bc you fill up less but it does hurt to fill it lol. I love the wagons, specifically in black! It looks really cool and you don’t see many of them (at least where I live). I have an xc60 and see them often.",Volvo
How many proper station wagons were sold at your dealership last year? All my former Volvos were versatile.,Volvo
"Normally I switch up the tires each season, summer and winter tires. Always put the ones with most pattern in the front, then swap them up next season. When it's time to actually get new tires, it's a complete set because the wear are somewhat equal both front and rear. Even if 2/4 tires may have ""1 season left"" I still swap them if the other two are worn down.

Never cheap out on tires, and make sure you have good tires for the correct season. As someone who lives in Norway, there are winter tires and snow tires. ""All season"" is complete bullshit, even though I'm not sure that's still a thing where I live.",Volvo

Turbo to go past 300hp. But pistons/cylinders and headgasket will not hold much over 350 from what I hear.,Volvo
I’m surprised that its tongue was not glued by licking frozen metal.,Volvo
Why do you have to change the secondary battery? Mine's 10 years old and it's working fine. Usually it's the main battery that goes first.,Volvo
My understanding from the people of Reddit who have done this is that you deduct the “rent” or interest on the outstanding payments. I need to actual contract to get the verbiage on this and to see what the “interest” portion of the monthly payment would be.,Volvo
"Genesis is a glorified Hyundai, Audi is a more expensive VW, and it’s laughable you even put Jeep Grand Cherokee in there as all Chrysler products are generally trash.  Wife and I went away from our ‘15 Volvo V60 to a ‘18 GMC Terrain Denali for 2-3 years and we jumped at the first chance to get back into a Volvo, and even though we “downgraded” to a 2012 XC60, we barely lost any key features over the 2018 Denali and even gained the auto-wiper feature which I love.  As far as rarity I hardly ever see any V90’s on the road FWIW.  The V90 will probably be our next Volvo.",Volvo

Im not as familiar with the s40v50 chassis motors but on the b5234t3 blocks your good for up to about 400hp on a totslly stock motor with boost by gear and by slowly ramping in boost otherwise youll crack the cylinder walls. Can pull tricks from the old honda guys and devcon the block for added strength and with new rods you should be good to 600 or so on stock crank and pistons to my knowledge. The heads head gaskets and stock head bolts seem to hold up well beyond what the block will take. Been seeing some swedish dudes pushing 1000+ with factory gaskets and bolts.,Volvo
I could drive any other brand of luxury SUV and not care what others think about me. A Volvo avoids others thinking about me altogether.,Volvo

We need to do something to gain non Volvo customers but also retain our core base. I’ve seen the numbers many stores are seeing a low lease retention in certain markets mine included due to competition. I’m at the biggest store in my state so getting customers isn’t really an issue but retaining them has been a little tough.

Sounds like the sales are speaking for themselves as well. I know I see more and more Volvos on the road in my area and a lot less Mercedes. There are a ton of BMWs on the road here but honestly hardly any of them are the newer body styles. Most people I talk to think the front ends are terrible, and I couldn't agree more.

Next best is the reputable independent Volvo specialist. Sounds like you found a good one. $400 for that service is a great deal!

I would never take my Volvo to a mechanic that doesn’t specialize in them. Not because they’re particularly hard to work on or anything like that. They’re actually quite simple. They’re just very particular about using the exact Volvo fluids and Genuine parts. A general shop probably won’t go out of their way to buy the Genuine Volvo fluids or source parts from Volvo/FCP euro. They’ll put in something off the shelf that matches spec. It may or may not cause issues down the line but for me I’d rather not find out. I know a Volvo specialist will stick with the right parts and fluids they know from experience",Volvo
Good point.,Volvo
"The app isn't clear, but the trip shows **combined** mpg not a real mpg calculation. It varies by year and model, but Volvo PHEVs average somewhere around 25-30mpg and 50 kwh/100 miles. 

As an example, if you drive 25 miles a day for the workweek and charge every night, and the ICE engine barely engaged, it may say something like you did 999.9 mpg since the math is just miles / gallon used. Similarly, if you drove with gas all week you could get 1 kwh/100 miles.

When someone says something like they're getting 50+ mpg or 15 kwh/100 miles, ask them how they think it's more efficient than a Prius hybrid and the most efficient EV on the market at the same time?",Volvo

And to be clear, I do not dislike my XC40, but as I only recently changed cars, it’s quite easy for me to compare both.  I do like the Pilot Assist and the matrix headlights, and the heated steering wheel / seats and windscreen are excellent (way faster to heat than the Audi).",Volvo

Jesus Christ man they’re showing you 11,500 off the price of the car and you think you’re gonna get more? Don’t get greedy here they’re hooking you up.  You absolutely cannot get 10% off the sticker price plus the 7500 or other various lease bonuses. Anybody who told you that is nuts. The margin on the cars is only like $1800, all this $11,500 in discounts you’re seeing is all Volvo incentive money.

If you do the buyout from the dealer, you have to wait 90 days and you’ll have to pay a doc fee. 

If you call Volvo up and do the buyout directly, you won’t have to pay the doc fee and you won’t have to wait 90 days (and Volvo will pull back from the dealer about $2000) so you’re literally screwing them over after they’re trying to help you figure out how to get the car for a net of 8500 or $9000 off sticker price",Volvo

Lots of bracing helps with any deflection during hard barking. Which can pull the pad away from the rotor decreasing stopping power. The big beefy part of the bracket is to help the caliper stay in place during long braking or hard stops.

Volvo doesn’t use TPMS anymore and the new ABS sensor based system is crap.  Your tire lost pressure and failed.  It was driven quite a bit to be that damaged (like a mile+ with no air).  Who knows why.  Unfortunately without the damaged tire it’s impossible for Volvo to know why and replace it.  They won’t warranty replace it without the failed tire.   Sorry.,Volvo

I put them on my R just because the price difference was not much to upgrade. They help cool the brakes if you are driving hard and overheating them. Daily driving it won't make much of a difference. If you live in the mountains it may be a good idea. Definitely would recommend the zinc coating. It stops all the rust on the rotors that doesn't contact the pads.

"I’ve never known a factory or extended warranty to cover routine maintenance. That’s always out of pocket unless you additionally buy the pre-paid maintenance package that Volvo and other makes have started offering. 

They may deny covering warranty work if you can’t prove that routine maintenance and inspections were done. Some companies are more rigid on this than others and I have no first hand experience with Volvo to know one way or the other but I had experiences with Subaru denying turbo replacement until proof was given of all oil changes at the recommended intervals.

"2019 V60 T5 here. For traveling to work and back home I fill up once a month. It's only a 20 minutes trip with like 15 minutes of highway driving at 100 km/h or 62 mph. Over such a short distance the consumption is around 8,5 L/100 km or 27,7 mpg.

If I drive from, for example, Utrecht in the Netherlands to the German border over the highway the consumption is about 5.7 L/100 km or 41,2 mpg for 52 minutes of driving and a distance of 81.7 km or 50,7 miles. Again the highest speed there would be 62 mph.

Now we're in Germany and driving on the Autobahn with no speed limit for most of the way to for example Oberhausen. With speeds above 170 km/h or 105,6 mph and a distance of over 74,1 km or 44,3 miles and a duration of 1 hour and 7 minutes the consumption value goes up: 9,8 L/100 km or 24 mpg.

Thanks! In the process. I’m up to $14k off at another dealer. Waiting on a few quotes to come through and then will pit them against each other! I am glad to hear that the immediate lease buyout seems to work for most people as this should mean pretty big savings! Did you do a lease buyout as well?,Volvo

"If it was me, I would:

##Check out and compare the v90 to:

Audi Allroad, and Mercedes E450 wagon.

Both are unique and fun but have high cost of ownership & maintenance. I would go with the V90 personally because I like the fit and finish and clean simplicity of Volvo.

##I would compare the XC90 to:

Audi Q7, Lexus TX 350, and Lexus GX 550.

This is a much harder comparison and I really like the new look of the Lexus GX.
I have not driven one, but 

I would absolutely stay away from Hyundai, Kia, Genesis, and Jeep. Between the recalls for possible fires and other quality control concerns I would not spend my money on any of these brands at the moment. My work parking garage still has signs posted that it will not allow entry to many Kia and Hyundai vehicles due to fire concerns.

##Honorable Mention:
If you are looking for a big lower cost vehicle that is very capable, you may also consider the Toyota Highlander or Grand Highlander compared to the XC90 (they have good cargo room, reliable/dependable, and relatively cheap to maintain, but have much cheaper interior fit and finish and are simply not unique, they are not as safe as a Volvo (arguably not much is), and it may be harder to get one.",Volvo

"Oh ok, the fob itself doesn’t “communicate” with the car, the car is the one looking for the fob signal. So if you can’t clone an old fob you’re gonna have to get a new one and program that fobs individual code into the car. You cannot use an old fob since the code of it is unknown without having access to the old car it belonged to.

Still it is possible to buy a new fob for not that much and programming should be possible by another party, doesn’t have to be Volvo, and definitely not for $900.

Look around, maybe a Volvo specific mechanic? Good ones should have access to VIDA or can crack the pin using VDASH and pair the fob for you.",Volvo

There’s not much you can do that will make a big difference except changing tires to the most quiet you can get which is typically the skinniest tires with the smallest rims you can fit and tires specifically made to be quiet.

"Im not sure about where volvo is heading. They had a high momentum but I believe it somehow got lost. The ex models look ugly and especially the ex30. i have not seen in flesh but interior looks really cheap and more like a budget car. I dont have any high hope for the coming ex60 but hope to be suprised.

I guess these models are a sign of times to come. volvo is a chinese brand and obviously they want to cater to the enormous chinese market. I guess the ex30 can be successful there as a lot of other chinese brands make ugly and strange cars so it will probably have demand. same with em90. ugly but will probably be successful as well. 

I foresee the dark ages when it comes to cars going forward. More ugliness. Goodbye scandinavian minimalism. nice knowing ya",Volvo

Interestingly,  on my S60 Recharge my rears are wearing slightly faster than my fronts, because I do mostly in town driving in pure mode, so the car is basically just RWD at that point.

"Even better, I moved to S. Korea with my US Spec XC60 and since Google Maps isn't allowed to do routing within Korea, I can't use the dashboard or HUD navigation anymore. Waze will work in the infotainment, but Waze routing is garbage in Korea. None of the Korean map apps are available in the US Spec AAOS.

However, Android Auto works perfectly fine with all the Korea map apps like Naver, T-Maps, etc. !

The Korean spec Volvos all use T-Maps instead of Google Maps. I asked the local Volvo dealership to flash our OS so it would support T-Maps, but they said they cannot on the 2022s. Apparently, 2024 US Spec models support T-Map integration now (or at least allow for re-flashing), but I'm SOL with my 2022. Not the end of the world, I just use my phone for navigation still, but there's all these features of the car we can't use now (yeah it's self inflicted moving overseas).

Even more maddening is Car Play integration, which works great. I had bought a wireless receiver and my wife's iPhone connected pretty well most of the time (it eventually stopped being so great, so it's a waste of money now). You get split screen apps on the infotainment, and I thought I saw that they updated it so Apple Maps works in the driver dashboard now too. So obviously the integration is possible. 

It's pretty obvious that they are stonewalling Android Auto integration to try and continue to force AAOS. I'm a software engineer and it would have made way more sense to add on the ""automotive"" features like climate control and what not to Android Auto rather than split off a completely separate app for it.

Also, since I'm on a soapbox, the bluetooth internet sharing is so finicky and annoying to have to setup every time you get in the car.",Volvo

"To me, it says they spent some time thinking about the kind of car they wanted.  I know when I bought my first V60, it was the result of creating a spreadsheet of potential used cars (I never buy new) in my price range and with the sorts of requirements I had, and then finding examples of them out in the real world and test driving them.

After doing that for a while, and going through a number of brands including Acura, Infiniti, even a Buick (that was actually a rebadged Opel), it became clear that the V60 was the best car for me.

That one was a T5 AWD.  After living with it and loving it for about half a year, it was crashed and totaled.  It performed so well in the crash, and I had enjoyed it so much, that I bought another one just like it, except faster, with better handling, and with a more reliable engine.

I'd say most Volvo drivers in the US have thought about their purchase, and weren't just looking for a set of wheels to get from A to B.

Really depends on the tread depth. If they are like new it’s fine to replace just one. If they have decent wear it’s not great to replace just one.

"The 20 and 21 are essentially the same car in that model year. I would get the 21 and buy it from the Volvo dealer so you can get a certified preowned warranty. That would give you unlimited mileage warranty through 2026. Also, while it’s under CPO warranty, you have the ability to buy up the warranty for a couple more extra years of coverage. 

You see a lot of 20/21s with about 35,000 miles is because they were leased originally for three years/36,000 miles. Those are awesome cars because they had free maintenance for the entire lease.

"This is how you KEEP them timeless. If you have a new model, then keep messing around with the styling, making changes for the sake of making changes, you instantly date the previous model year. Look at Lexus.

Of course, that's what most manufacturers want. They want you to look at your three year old car and feel like it's outdated. 

Same for technology features. How many features does the average driver use on a regular basis? They can keep throwing crap into the center display, but does any of it really make a difference? We're so used to the way phones operate that we expect the same from anything with a display. It's gotta be bigger, brighter, have higher resolution, more crap, more apps, but is it really useful? 

Most manufacturers are struggling to keep their software FUNCTIONAL, much less, secure. What's going to happen in five or ten years when they have mountains of legacy products still out there plus all their new stuff?

"How often do you need to change your pistons? At how many miles should you swap out your headlights? Do you replace your brake pads every 30,000 miles, regardless of how worn they are?

I am a mechanic. Timing chains aren't a maintenance item like oil changes and transmission fluid changes or timing belts. They're an item that only needs replacement if and when they're worn out. A good engine design will give you plenty of warning that that is happening. There's absolutely no reason to change a timing chain that's not worn out... It's the entire point of a chain vs. a belt. They don't just break suddenly with zero warning... Anyone who says otherwise was ignoring the noise at startup and cam/ crank correlation codes.

Timing chains only need replacement if they or associated parts fail. There's some engines that are very prone to that. However, they are designed and intended to never need replacement unless they wear out. Yes, they ""stretch"" (though that's actually a misnomer, it's pin, guide, and sprocket wear that makes them seem to stretch) A well designed timing chain system, with adequate guides and a proper tensioner/wear compensator, will typically last the life of the engine if the engine is properly maintained.",Volvo

"A lot of people in this thread are telling you wrong, and I do this every single day.

Your buyout amount will be the balance line on your lease proposal. Minus the principal amount of the three payments you make. PLUS $450 buyout fee. PLUS Doc fee (if you buy it out thru the dealer). Sales tax is impossible to say, as it varies by state- in some states, you pay all the sales tax on the lease upfront at signing. In other states the sales taxes evenly divided over all lease payments. Also sales tax rates vary and in some states they’re capped..

They’re holding out on you though, Volvo has way more than $9500 incentives that encompass lease cash, a 7500 lease bonus because it’s a plug-in, and you may qualify for other things such as affinity/a-plan or volvo loyalty bonus.

Discount on an XC 90 recharge should be closer to $11,000 instead of 9500.


To answer a couple othe r questions… Yes, you have to keep the lease for three payments (if you buy it out through the dealer). There’s nothing to stop you from paying it off sooner than that but Volvo will pull back some backend money from the dealership if you buy it sooner than three payments. Per the Volvo lease agreement, you can totally call the day after you write the lease and buy it out for 450 early buyout fee… But the dealer is not gonna let you do that if you buyout thru them.

The interest/money factor on the recharge leases is crazy high. Your monthly payments will be like 50% interest. Volvo does this specifically because they know people are only leasing these cars to capture the discounts and then immediately buying it out. Money factor is much better on the gas models.. 

That’s why they immediately piled in a 2K discount next to the 9500 because the real discount should be like 11 1/2 thousand.

In a nutshell, if you lease it and then buy it out with an $11,500 discount on the lease… You’re going to net the car after buyout at about $8800 off sticker 

You people who try to get on lease hacker and outsmart Volvo and the dealer are just wasting your time. It’s very simple… Would you like to save $8800 off the price of the car? If so, lease it and then buy it out after 90 days. Otherwise you can buy it outright and probably negotiate something like $2500 off the sticker price to buy it in a single transaction.

So quit driving yourself crazy and trying to number crunch it down to exactly pennies… If you want to save $8800, lease to buyout. If you want to get negotiated discount to purchase the car, you’re looking at maybe saving $2500.",Volvo

V60 will definitely drive better than XC40, it’ll also be a quieter ride overall.

The small amount of displacement you lose is far outweighed by the increase in power. Also theres block shims for mild builds which are more then tough enough for 400hp.

"Well i don’t want to sound like a fan boy. But I think you’re underestimating how advanced and what potential Teslas system has, as a lot of people do. The Mercedes L3 software only works on one piece of road under specific circumstances.  It’s basically more of the same as they’ve always used.

Teslas system while flawed and needing improvement is very different and still is much more advanced and i believe it has a better chance at achieving full autonomy. The mapping, data collection, always connected capability and processing power is what makes me believe it. 

All Teslas are basically powerful desktop computers while the most are still on Nintendo gameboy level processing power and Mercedes perhaps on console level in their best most expensive cars. No Mercedes can even get close to do what the Teslas in their beta full self driving mode can do in the US. The Waymo cars in San Fransisco are probably the ones that come the closest.",Volvo

I still vastly prefer the Volvo setup to what I saw from Audi, Lexus, Mazda, Toyota (I know the last two aren’t luxury but still).

I rarely drive in the city and my commute is mostly motorway and 50-60kmh speed but it's around 1-1.5 liters more according to the car.

Also good to know that car not getting to operating temperature often will make fuel go into the oil past the piston rings and dilute it. It's not bad if it's a gas car and gets to operating temperature every so often as small amount of gas will just evaporate. Diesel doesn't evaporate as easily I think so checking the oil level for rising should be noted and also changing the oil a bit more frequently to prolong the engine life. Also as the diesels don't warm well in city driving, it shortens the engine life to drive with a cold engine. The best thing for an engine is to be most of the operating time at the optimal temperature of around 90°C.",Volvo

As a UK punter who purchased a new xc60 last year I have to say Volvo was the best of the lot in my mind after test driving an Audi q5, bmw x3/5, jag x pace and a genesis gv60. 

In short most the others came with very little as standard (no doubt US specs are different). So a decent spec German equiv requires you to remortgage the house!

Even with some of the optional extras I genuinely left the Audi showroom amazed and a little angry at how awful their driver aids were.  I was selling an 2008 Audi A5 for the xc60 (had a kid) and had always thought Audi would lead the way in terms of tech but the interior and aids were not all that different to my 2008 Audi. 

In short they’ve been living off their reputation a little in my mind. 

The Volvo sales process was honest and there were conversations to be had which wasn’t the feeling I got in the others. 4 year interest free loan on top of the discounts also helped!

As a side note my favourite was the Genesis but their sales process was awful and I’m actually yet to see one on uk roads so would have great fun trying to sell it into the second hand market in 3 years!",Volvo

"An experienced driver can possibly reduce the amount of fuel used by using manual mode as the older cars didn't have the best automatics. Haven't tested personally on Volvo though car though, but I did save about 1l/100km on a BMW 530d by driving on manual. The difference on a Volvo truck was about 2-3l/100km, but was very tiring mentally.

I usually use manual mode if I'm driving on a road with lots of inclines, especially when it's slippery (auto changing gears at the wrong time can result in you coming down ass first).

If you're not used to driving manual, you definitely have no need for it, and as you're not driving a truck (or lorry or semi or whatever you want to call them), there's absolutely no need for you to use manual in 99% of situations.

Also, some older automatics (possibly newer ones too) skip first gear when using winter mode, don't know if this is one of those, but might be worth trying if you ever drive on snow. The W marked button should engage winter mode for you",Volvo
"You think so until you've lived with and used both systems extensively.

Android OS adds literally nothing that you didn't already have with the old school (and reliable) plug-your-phone in Android Auto. A step forward would have been to use wireless android auto and keep the Sensus system.

How do you deal with letting someone else use your car? They can no longer plug their phone in and get their Google maps results and history. They've got your maps history, their in YOUR Google account.

Voice assistant? You literally have that on your phone and it works even better than in the car. Android Auto plugged in? ""Hey Google, navigate to xxx""


How do you deal with using Spotify when you have no cell service? You have to Bluetooth your phone to use downloaded playlists because there aren't any on the car OS and they've blocked android auto plugin in.

The new settings screen is awful, buttons way too small and extra steps were added to get to settings that were easily accessible with the tile screen on Sensus where you can just swipe left and use large tiles. It's like they designed the Google OS to be used by a passenger, not by a driver who is taking their eyes off the road to use it. The larger Sensus button tiles are vastly superior. I don't want to have to pull my car over to change settings.

You know how long it takes to get to OffRoad mode now? I use the downhill assist frequently on windy mountain winter roads and being able to flick it on quickly has saved me on several occasions. I now have to hope a passenger can handle that task for me or else I'm falling off a cliff.

Google maps doesn't work without cell service either, unless you have downloaded maps. Updates and glitches tend to clear out downloaded maps. In functionality, the Google maps integration is no better than a cell phone with Google maps installed. It is not a true satellite GPS with the entire countries map preinstalled. It left me stranded when camping because my downloaded maps disappeared on me. I should have brought a 12v powered Garmin unit.....

Sure swiping new app tiles on the main screen is nice, but not any faster or more useful than a single swipe right to access the same tiles Sensus gave you on their app screen. It's the same number of swipes and presses. People loving it are being fooled by cosmetic improvements, not functionality improvements. There are glitches galore and the system needs to be rebooted frequently. It's like having an android phone. Apps crash and need their cache cleared and to be reset. The whole unit needs to be restarted mid drive often. Who the hell wants this in their car?? The old system had pretty much a zero tolerance policy for failures.

Buttons all around are way smaller and harder to use. Oh and not only are the car companies saving money by not making their own software anymore, they're also making money selling your information to insurance companies so they can jack up your rates based on how many times you have to brake hard.

They took that idea from OnStar, who has been doing the same thing in various cars even without Google OS.

Edit to add more scary / bad news about these things. I've got several friends that are software engineers, cyber security experts and even top computer hackers in the world. Guess what they all have to say about how secure these new cars are with all this tech 😬 you can hack pretty much any new car these days. That billionaire CEO who 'drove herself' into a lake? She was hacked, locked in her car, and sent into the lake. She had a Tesla but that's not to bash Teslas because all new cars have similar tech with similar vulnerability.

I’ve seen news Volvo has said they are going to refresh the SPA one more time but that will take time to get to market.

Volvo is a small enough player they could continue marching toward all electric and stay committed, discontinue the old models, give up the sales they lose without hybrids for now and wait it out for EVs, try to increase market share and grow with the market.

No idea what’s right for them. I just got a feeling the existing customers aren’t all ready to slide right into the EV replacement for the Volvo they are driving now.

"So I stepped away from Volvo this year and nothing against the product I like Volvo's I still think they seem okay. I've seen a lot of weird issues for people with the digital readouts and stuff like that. I don't like seeing and I would not want to be driving down the road or start my car and I can't see how fast I'm going or anything like that. That's a huge mess in my opinion. I did opt for something else after. I just sold my Volvo and I based my opinion on the reliability of newer Volvo's and the cost of ownership on newer Volvos being a lot higher than in the past made it the same as what I purchased. I'm sure I'll come back to them again in the future because I do love a nice dad wagon, but I'm going to give them a few years to marinate as it were and what they're trying to create going forward.",Volvo
"Hmmm, husband drives a 1998 v90 and I drive a 1998 v70.  Great cars, simple engine.  Husband taught himself how to maintain and fix any issue that may have happened.  Money has been tight for 50 years and because we paid cash for used cars we were able to stay out of debt and have reliable transportation. Never cared/care how  other people view our old ass cars.",Volvo
"Volvo is not flashy or trying to be anything whereas other luxury cars, owners only get them for brand association and it’s embarrassing if you see someone trying to appear rich driving a q3 but not an rsq3 or a standard macan and not a GTS .. if you’re going to buy a Porsche buy a damn Porsche",Volvo
"Forgot to say, but i used 55mm bolts. Absolutely no bottoming out or any similar issue. NO MATTER WHAT YOU GET, MAKE SURE THEY’RE THE RIGHT THREAD COUNT",Volvo
Interesting. I get 24 on my 19 S60,Volvo
"I think that’s way exaggerated. 99% cars on the road have some scratches or rashes on the wheels and there is no way this damage would be as serious as you might have thought. Also, if it is really hiding some damage inside the metal, you won’t be able to tell unless you have the right lab equipments as well.",Volvo
Lifelong BMW guy too. Never going back. ‘15 T6 V60 with the Polestar tune. Only thing I miss from my BMW wagons would be the dual rear opening hatch.,Volvo
That is a great idea,Volvo
Good business idea a driving parts warehouse,Volvo
"Haha, they changed the lines in our lot recently and people are slow to change their parking habits.",Volvo
"this is fair, part of the reason i got rid of the jeep was that i drive highway and plowed roads. storms like this are not common in the north east....unfortunately",Volvo
"What happens when it measures maximum swedeness or 
, god forbid, no swedeness whatsoever?",Volvo

Niiiice,Volvo
If it’s available in the states I can strongly recommend the Ferrita 3” downpipe with a race cat! I’ve got it on mine and it sounds just delicious,Volvo
D4 engine is very economical,Volvo
"That’s a very lovely looking car, those v60s have such nice lines.",Volvo
Soak all the contacting areas with the hib with PB blaster. Pull the backing plate and beat the shit out of it with a bigger hammer,Volvo

I can swim,Volvo
"PIRELLI  SCORPION VERDE ALL SEASON is what i got.   


Everyone online loves the CC2! I might get them but also thinking about dedicated winter tire.   


I am in new england and with our variable modern winter conditions i am concered about what would happen to the winter tires when the weather warms up randomly. Thinking it will just be somehting I have to deal with if i want to have winter tires and the times i have the winter tires will be worth it.",Volvo
Probably because it's not true. At least not today. Maybe in the old days. Volvo doesn't say this in my manual.,Volvo
"the aftermarket wireless adapters are slightly goofy but overall work great for me (on sensus).  I usually don't even think about it, 90% of the time it just works. carlinkit 4.0",Volvo

From what I’ve been told it is but we shall see.,Volvo
"Drive it hard and check if the gearbox behaves somewhat normal. When driving with heavy cargo on tow the gearbox will go warm. I’d also do a service on the awd haldex. there’s a small filter that should be changed / or cleaned.

Automat box and haldex should be serviced every 80 000km, but it’s not in the servicebook unless it’s a policecar or taxi…",Volvo
First time I’ve heard anyone describe a car looking like a fat American cop. I will be using that from now on,Volvo
Ah alright,Volvo
"Will it leave you stranded? No. Does it have way more things go wrong than you'd expect for what is supposedly a reliable brand? Yes. 

I've had repeatedly warped brakes, engine mounts needing replacement, sunroof gasket replacement, water intrusion in a tail light, and needed the transmission reprogrammed twice because it learns weird adaptation and shifts too hard at low speed. This is in less than 2 years of owning a 2019 CPO that I bought with only 17k miles on it.

Honestly it's kind of killed the allure of the brand for me. Nice car, but these days clearly too complicated and not completely sorted out.",Volvo
Still loving my 02 9-5 Aeros 18.5 gallon tank,Volvo
"Xc60 are very nice and a T6 at that!! Congrats man and enjoy it, 340.000km is nothing :)",Volvo
"As a Volvo dealer tech, the Recharge cars are my favorite to drive and the most likely choice I’d pick to own. Well done.",Volvo
"On a service loaner with mileage, you should calculate $0.20 to $0.25 cents per mile this car currently has and ask for an additional discount on top of the regular discount that you would get normally.",Volvo
"Well at least at my dealer(I’ve seen some people speak of this from others as well) we have built a calculator that shows a customer a estimate of how much their lease pay off will be after 3 payments while using the incentives that pay down the cap cost of the lease.(This is for all recharges) Most of my customers that want to buy a recharge will do this and expect to see around 5-6 thousand in savings doing this method. The more incentives the better so loyalty helps as well. The reason you wait three months is to actually get the rebate on the payoff, if you do it before it will be charged back. I can explain the math but it’s a lot. It works as I myself have 6 customers buying their lease out this month.",Volvo
i know there are better alternatives but i got it for a really good price so i kinda just wanna try it out instead of just throwing it away,Volvo
Its totaled,Volvo
Confirm not to come here. Im mean we don't even have the plug in XC40 in the USA and if we did that thing would sell so well.,Volvo
"Insurance should cover it all. 

For what it’s worth, she didn’t hit the nail and it immediately exploded. The nail caused a leak and it was driven with little or no pressure until the tire got so hot the sidewall let go.",Volvo
"Idk sometimes it shows i have 10L left then 80L left so idk really 
I have a 70L tank",Volvo
"I love the look of the Lexus, it also drives incredibly well because of the air suspension, relatively quick 5 speed automatic, and 4 litre V8.
But the Volvo will always remain special to me and I will keep it for as long as possible.",Volvo
"To be fair in a promotion for the Saab 9000 (1994), the opening line is, ""Many car manufacturers change models each year finding it easier to restyle an automobile then rethink it"" ... ""But Saab is one auto maker who politely declines to participate in this annual undertaking.""  I know this is obviously not Volvo branding but I think that Saab and volvo have and a similar ethos in this regard. And see both manufacturers doing this throughout their respective timelines.",Volvo
Well it's a mild hybrid so not sure what you're expecting? My 23 xc60 t8 which is a PHEV obviously has a lot higher mpg seeing as I use fuel only on long drives.,Volvo
"To this I would add that, as people who own three classic Saabs and drove 9-5 wagons (and NG9-5) before getting our V90 CC, the simple, elegant design of the V90 is what drew us to it. It’s the closest we can get to a new Saab.",Volvo
"There's only one other Volvo wagon in my town other than me, and she won't even wave at me when we're driving.

For shame.

I'd park my v90 next to your v60.",Volvo
"2016 V60CC T5 (5 cyl) - 23.1

2025 confirmed last year of S60,Volvo
"Yeah mine is a B5 powertrain with the crystal shifter. I checked out your page and you have one of the nicest V60s I’ve ever seen. Would love to have the B&W sound system. Was planning on installing one to mine, but the subwoofer is kind of tricky to install. Hopefully my next Volvo will have one!",Volvo
Awesome car. More accurately an oddball than rare though. They are hard to find because demand was low and as a result production was low. They aren’t hard to find because they are highly desirable and sought after.,Volvo
"I don’t think so, Volvo have told us that the new parts are modified to fix the ingress, but if they do fail again they (should, speak to your dealer about this) be covered under parts warranty.",Volvo
"Here you go! https://accessories.volvocars.com/en-us/S90(17-)/Accessories/Document/VCC-516198/2018

Edit: Looking again, that may not be a Volvo OEM diffuser. It looks like there’s some extra bit extending under the tailpipes.",Volvo
"It’s awesome right? Rareness depends on where u are at. In the states they seem to be rare. In europe  there are still loads of them.

What year is it? ‘05? ‘06?

I hope so. I'm Norwich based so not only do I recognise the Barshens locations but I've actually run into (once literally) Ashens.,Volvo
This is why I carry duct tape.  Who needs a real spare!,Volvo
The extra material in the caliper acts as a heat sink. Volvo does this on some of their heavier cars. The P2 XC90 is like that as well. Helps cool the brakes faster.,Volvo
"I love my orange key and use that one more than the black one for sure. Never noticed anything different in regards to functions. I think the black one is like an admin key that allows in depth changes to the vehicles configuration. But not something you notice on the day to day. At least I don’t notice anything different after approx 2 years of using both.
Edit: I have a c40 so could be different.",Volvo
29mpg in the 2l petrol C30,Volvo
Crystal White CC gang!,Volvo
"I'm sure it has its perks, not doing front CV boots as often is probably one of them, or paying double compared to other cars it's size when doing brakes",Volvo
I completely agree! I currently daily a Saab 9-5 wagon and also have in the fleet a P2 XC70 and XC90. The eventual replacement will most likely be a V90/V60.,Volvo
My dad tells me it blows up the car,Volvo
"What do you mean that timing chain don't need to be replaced? They are not indestructible. They are stretching. You HAVE to change timing chain - it doesn't need to be like belt, every, let's say 60k miles, but they have to be replaced.

The same as ""blah blah automatic gearbox doesn't need oil change"". Bullshit.",Volvo
I think this take is accurate!,Volvo
"I hear ya.  I’m a middle aged woman, not someone able to sift through endless problems or “do my own work”.  Maybe the 2025 cx90 will have ironed out some problems?",Volvo
"Subaru Outback wagon. I’ve got a few friends with them and not only do they absolutely love them, they have all been crazy reliable.",Volvo
This is also exactly why people buy a Volvo since the design doesn’t change like with bmw every 5 minutes,Volvo
This seems like the more interesting route to 400. I'm definitely starting research.,Volvo
Speaking with most of my customers i find that most are not ready for full electric but they do like the Recharge series. I've been selling and getting in a ton of Recharge XC90/XC60's and my customers rave about them. I personally think we have the best plug in but I may be biased. The biggest complaint I get is that its the same vehicle as before.,Volvo
"“Personally, my sales volume has gone up”. I guess that says it all.",Volvo
It’s only in the xc90 in 2023. Maybe it was a pandemic supply chain change?,Volvo
You need winter tires for that type of weather,Volvo
Hope u fire up the engine from time to time - never let gas and / or engine run old,Volvo
Independently minded. Value safety and quiet luxury.,Volvo
"Im reading 2025 is the end for the S60 and V60 in their current configurations, PHEV. I too hope to see some innovation in 2026. But we might have to wait until 2030.",Volvo
"If someone doesn’t actually, message me. I’ll work out a flight etc, and money",Volvo
"If its yellow dont panic it likely just needs to be topped off. These warnings are often way ahead of critical levels and its just that ""a warning for you to check the level and top off if needed""

You will have more than enough time and distance to get somewhere and buy some oil to top off. 

Don't panic, but don't put off getting the oil asap. Also keep an eye on your oil level moving forward if your still under your change interval. 



If the light is red then it is an emergency. I would top off if possible but would not drive the car any significant distance. This is usually a critical warning and may affect the engine.",Volvo
"I did this last summer too.

love my C30, wanted a wee bit more space. wagons are my favourite so I tried a bunch of V60 and V90s.

I just didn't like the modern volvos if we're being honest. I love how they look, but something just never really clicked for me. found the perfect spec V90 and was so close but never pulled that trigger.

ended up cross shopping with cayennes and bought a macan turbo. I wish it were a wagon but c'est la vie. it's a lot of fun but maybe I still want an XC70 or something for skiing and biking, something I can really not worry about and mod for outdoorsy life.",Volvo
"You posted it here.… so there is no chance to forget it. ;) 

Come back, when you lost your keys.",Volvo
"I do have to say remote start sucks on the Volvos.  It takes FOREVER for me to pull up the app, login, wait for it to connect, then tap the button then wait (FOREVER again) for it to register you pressed the button, then you wait again (Yes FOREVER) for it to finally figure out you wanted to start the car.   By that time you're already at the car you wanted to warm or cool down before you got to it.",Volvo
This is what Volvo Car USA charges a dealer for the Polestar Engineering Optimization Upgrade software when installing through VIDA at the dealership. OTA software has no cost to the consumer or dealer.,Volvo
I'd definitely look for CPO then. In the US you'll at least get a one year unlimited mile warranty.,Volvo
Sounds right,Volvo
I'm currently in Dumbass Mode and hoping it's only the top two. Because there is a snowball's chance in hell of that being the case.,Volvo

Helll yeah.,Volvo
"To be fair, consistency and already being the best on several aspects is better than new but problematic imo.",Volvo
We got a 2019 XC90 with a 6 and 2 yr old with the light leather interior and it has been fine for them. The vehicle came with the all weather floor mats and they have held up nicely.,Volvo

"I literally just got back from skiing in Maine an hour ago. The 4 inches we got Wednesday night made for some great skiing on Thursday! I am jealous that I missed the blizzard (they are calling for 21” now in Bridgton). Where are you planning to go? I would assume either Pleasant, Sugar, or Sunday?

I would take my Volvo SUV in the snow any day before my Toyota SUV, and especially before the Nissan rental I just dropped off this morning. Heck, I would trust my prior ‘11 S80 out in the snow over my Toyota SUV. My experience has been that Volvo’s are amazing in snow, but NOTHING is good on ice, so still be safe and drive responsibly for the road conditions.",Volvo
"It doesn’t work like that. If you want to buyout early you have to pay the remaining payments + the residual value.

The reason there’s such a large discount is because the money factor is probably high.",Volvo
I have CC2s on my old car and they're great for occasional snow cover. Much better than the P0s.,Volvo
I just think they look so.. meh.  Generic.  They aren't as pleasing to the eye as a Volvo sedan.,Volvo

"Honestly, I'd be kinda surprised if a full drum kit would fit in a S60. Two tires are a tight fit into the trunk in my 2019 and the backseat is definitely lacking IMO. You might want to look at the V60's instead as they have much more room. In terms of maintenance, I drive 25-30k a year so costs are a bit higher. I bring my car to a local indy for the oil changes to protect my warranty but all other maintenance I do at home. These cars aren't terribly hard to work on, although information is a bit limited on the SPA models without access to VIDA. I've only had a few issues...on the 2016 V60 (105k), it's needed a wheel sensor, an alternator and sway bar links. On my 2019 S60 (106k) its only needed a new steering wheel button. We've put 85k on the V60 and 50k on the S60.",Volvo

I guess this one’s on us, but still disappointed with how their tpms works, seems about as useful as not having it",Volvo

"As long as you have spare keys for the car it is fairly easy for a locksmith to clone them (note that key and remote and completely separate from each other).

It is only when you’ve lost all keys you’ve basically gotta go to the dealer since you need CEM and IMMO PIN codes which is hard to get on P2s.

You can clone keys yourself but you’re gonna need tools for that (that costs maybe $100), but you’re probably better off finding someone that can do it.",Volvo
"It feels 'heavy' and less torquey to me so far than my 3.0 I6 turbo engine, but in my short time in the car, it certainly is more pleasant than the P3 chassis. And the different drive options look fun to explore. I've never plugged a car in before.",Volvo
"Thank you! This is exactly the kind of guidance I am looking for! In negotiating this, what are the best levers to try to pull? Sale price? Residual? I was less focused on the monthly payment as I was thinking of it as short term, but maybe not the best way to think about this?",Volvo

Parts are interchangeable and you don’t have to a rocket scientist to work on them( looking at you bmw) I got rid of my bug eye wrx with almost. 300k miles because I couldn’t fit my kids cars seats .

Xc90 is a great vehicle and one of our best vehicles that Volvo has to offer and I’m glad you are happy with your XC90. Multiple of my Co-workers own one and they all love them as well. Timeless design and still one of if not the safest vehicle on the road.,Volvo
Currently we have been experiencing propulsion systems warnings on new plug ins and when they come in it literally cannot be replicated.

"My factory tire blew out at 20k miles. I had the 21"" rims. It ruined the rim . One rim was $1,400 and the tire was $450. I couldn't replace one tire. It ended up being cheaper for me to buy new aftermarket 20 inch rims and tires.",Volvo

I think the whole purpose of the plastic in a CC is to protect the paint from all the dirt and rocks being thrown at it off-roading. If you didn’t like the plastic parts maybe you could swap it out with parts on a regular V60?,Volvo

"Hans-Olov Olsson, who is currently the Vice Chairman of Volvo Car Corporation's Board of Directors, was responsible for sales in the USA at the end of the 1990s. In 1998, he succeeded in convincing the company's then CEO, Tuve Johannesson, that the company should invest in an SUV.

 

In August 1998, Volvo Cars project director Hans Wikman was commissioned to develop a proposal for a modern, 7-seater SUV that was not too large. The car project was named P28, was to be based on the same platform as the Volvo S80 and should be launched in 2002. The aim was to sell 50,000 cars a year, a goal that would be beaten by a clear margin – during the peak years 2004-2007, around 85,000 cars were sold each year. The USA has been the largest single market for the XC90, with record figures achieved in 2004 (38,800 cars sold) and 2005 (36,200).

At the same time as drawing up three design proposals, two in California and one in Gothenburg, a female reference group was brought together in California, including Swedish actress Maud Adams, to contribute their wishes and comments, as American women would make up a large proportion of the intended target group.

The 4th of May 1999 was an important day for the project. In temperatures of 41°C, the three design proposals were presented at Volvo Cars’ test track outside Phoenix, Arizona. Senior management and some members of the future project management attended the gathering, with the aim of reaching agreement on the focus of the design. The winning exterior proposal was designed by Doug Frasher from Volvo's Concept & Monitoring Center in California, who also designed the exterior of the Volvo S80.

">I’m thinking that the EV market stumble, plays a part here. It applies to all mfrs but specifically for Volvo, they were committed to going “all electric” and their future product was developed in that. Now we have a little slow down in adoption rate, maybe temporary maybe permanent. 

I don't think you're looking at this long term. EV's are already here to stay. It's already been decided. Not by you or by me, but by the worldwide car market.

The ""big slowdown"" that happened was just a slowdown of the growth. If you look at the fourth quarter, it was a record year for volume. EV market share ended 2023 at 7.6% of total volume, and it reached 8.1% for the fourth quarter alone.

We're already past the 5% adoption point where most experts believe there's no going back.

The number one selling car in the world last year was the Tesla Model Y, overtaking the Camry. And the number one electric vehicle manufacturer last year wasn't even Tesla. It was BYD, with 3 million vehicles sold. Elon Musk said in an interview that he isn't afraid of legacy automakers, he's afraid of BYD once they set up factories in NA and start flooding the US with cheap EV's. Can't happen? Remember when everyone said that about the Koreans and now the top midsize SUV's in almost every comparison test is the Kia Telluride and the Hyundai Palisade.

*And even if* the US slowed down it's adoption rate of EV's, that doesn't affect the EU or China.

Total vehicles sold by market in 2023:

US: 15.5 million

EU: 10.5 million

China: 30.1 million, and China is pushing green energy and transportation. HARD

Last year China installed more solar panels than what has been installed in the US EVER.

It takes, on average, 5-8 years to develop a car from scratch. So the cars that are going to be coming out in 2028-2032, the year most automakers say they will have a 50-100% EV lineup, *have already been discussed in the boardroom and greenlit.* There is no turning back.

People think the the ball is just starting to roll down the hill with the transition to EV's, when in actuality the ball is already a quarter of the way down.",Volvo

The Sanus could show a bigger map on the iPad like screen, but I never use that because I stick with CarPlay.

"Sure and I’m not necessarily saying you did anything wrong.  You could have checked your tires before you left, Volvos sensors could have worked exactly like they should and this still could have happened.

It’s easy to imagine you hit some hazard on the road without realizing.  The tire pressure went down quickly and the sensor gave the warning, but you were driving fast on the highway with low profile tires and it likely just happened before you could respond.

I’ll say that many years ago I used to drive on a road with lots of construction and thank god for road hazard!  3 different times I hit something on the road in my old Acura Integra and each time I could feel a change and get off the road to put on the spare.  And I didn’t have any kind of monitoring system. The fact that tires were higher profile then probably helped me from shredding them like you did.",Volvo

"You need to reset the battery management system.  If the battery has been in place for more than a year, don't fully reset it. (I'll explain this in a moment) You only want the car to re-learn state of charge. What you do is turn the ignition on but don't start the engine (hold the engine start button down without stepping on the brake until all the warning lights come on on the dash.) Then, you unplug the battery management system sensor- this is the little black box with a plug on it attached to the negative battery terminal. You unplug that plug for at least 10 seconds, I go for 30 seconds. Then, switch the ignition off, close the car doors and hood, lock the car, and let it sit undisturbed for at least 4-6 hours. This will force the car to re-learn state of charge.

The full BMS reset is what you SHOULD have done when you originally installed the battery. Normally, this is done through VIDA (or a professional level bi-directional scanner) and if you have VIDA and a suitable interface (DiCE or a J2534 tool) or bi-scanner, use that method. If you don't, [here's a link](https://youtu.be/iu9z5m78Szw?si=Eqn5OBzQ02bZjFtm) to a YouTube video showing you how to do this without a scan tool or VIDA. Please note that you will get no visual confirmation of the reset on older vehicles with an analog instrument cluster (2013 and down) Only the TFT clusters tell you the BMS was reset.

Only do a full reset if the battery has just been replaced with a brand new one in the last few months, otherwise, you can cause the car to constantly overcharge the battery which will damage it.",Volvo

Looks like a runflat to me considering that sidewall looks so rigid. I’ve never seen anything like this before but the RFTs on my BMW were terrible with getting bubbles from potholes. The roads in NY are terrible. I’m a pretty careful driver but I still hit them occasionally at night. My tire package I got from the dealer paid for itself in about 18 months after replacing 4/5 tires due to bubbles.

This approach is more scalable and cost-effective because it relies on cameras a relatively inexpensive sensor compared to LIDAR allowing for wider deployment across Tesla's entire vehicle lineup without significantly increasing costs.

Tesla has a vast fleet of vehicles on the road constantly collecting data, which is used to train its machine learning models. This ""fleet learning"" approach allows Tesla to continuously improve its autonomous driving algorithms based on real-world driving data from a diverse range of conditions and geographies. The sheer volume of data collected from its global fleet gives Tesla an edge in refining its autonomous systems.

Tesla's over-the-air software updates are a key advantage, allowing the company to regularly update the vehicle's software, including improvements to its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. This means that Tesla vehicles can receive the latest autonomous driving capabilities without needing to visit a service center, ensuring that customers always have access to the latest advancements.

Tesla's vertical integration, meaning it designs and manufactures nearly all components of its autonomous system in-house, including hardware like the Full Self-Driving computer, allows for optimized performance and quicker iterations. This level of control over both hardware and software components of the autonomous system is unique in the industry and can lead to more efficient development cycles. That it doesn’t work is your personal perception, it does what it is advertised to do so far. 

Most users report that Tesla's Autopilot and FSD provide a smooth and intuitive driving assistance experience, highlighting the system's ability to handle a wide range of driving scenarios with minimal intervention.

LIDAR, while not inherently is still not as good in my opinion because high-quality LIDAR systems are very expensive, making them less accessible for widespread use in consumer vehicles. The units often require external mounting, which makes the cars look like humpback whales. 

LIDAR performance also deteriorate in adverse weather conditions like heavy rain, fog, or bright sunlight, affecting its reliability. There are inherent limitations to LIDAR's range and resolution, which might restrict its effectiveness in some scenarios not really making them any more reliable than Teslas system. Additionally the data LIDAR generates requires significant processing power in comparison which raises questions about efficiency and necessity compared to Teslas system.",Volvo
"I own a 2015.5 xc-60 T6. Few things I recommend:

1. if oil is low don’t drive far definitely need to top off oil. 
2. In the future Always have a quart with you in the trunk. I put mine next to the spare tire
3. I know they claim you can go 10,000 miles between oil changes. DON’T, I go every 5,000 miles, since this change it has not used any oil.

"Wagons are stocked where they are sold. Dealers in Los Angeles will always have wagons on hand, that’s like half the volume. Also NYC and DC/Virginia.

A Polestar wagon will sit for months in Texas while dealers in Los Angeles all have waitlists a dozen deep.

A dealer in San Antonio has had a white polestar I think for like six months, while in LA that’s roughly the waitlist. 

But Volvo switched all remaining 2024 V60 Polestar production to be U.S.-spec a few months ago which is helping clear waitlists.

"I went to Sunday River, drove slow and safe!",Volvo
"Yes. Basically, do it before bedtime or something. You don't HAVE to wake the car up immediately after that 4-6 hours, it's a minimum.

The way this works is: 12-volt lead acid car batteries have a no-load voltage of about 12.5- 12.6v when fully charged. How much power can be drawn from that battery depends on the battery's individual characteristics. If you have a new battery with a capacity of 90 amp-hours, (fairly typical for a car battery) that means that, when new, if you draw a current of 90 amps form the battery, you'll be able to do that for 1 hour before the battery is drained to where further drain will damage it. Typically, this is when the battery reaches a voltage of about 10.8v. You could also draw 45 amps for 2 hours, or 180 amps for 1/2 an hour. Conversely, if you have a new 90ah battery that you've drained to 10.8v, and your car's alternator can charge it at a rate of 45 amps, it'll take about 2 hours to fully recharge it. Now, this almost never happens... But it does mean that there's a  constant relationship between voltage and state of charge. And as the battery ages and loses capacity, how much power is actually available at a given state of charge will drop. The battery management system keeps track of how old the battery is (provided it's reset when the battery is replaced) and its charging characteristics. As the battery wears down, its capacity relative to voltage will drop. And it stores that info, so at any given moment, it knows that, at whatever voltage, it'll be able to draw whatever amperage for whatever period of time And when the battery ages to where that relationship is such that there's barely enough capacity remaining to start the car when the battery is fully charged, it'll start warning you. However, if you replace that battery with a new one, the BMSs stored values will no longer match the actual battery. And because of the way batteries degrade, the BMS takes a very long time to adapt on its own to a new battery, if it ever even manages to do so.

A complete reset causes the BMS to assume there's a new battery that has the same or similar capacity and chemistry to the original. It also makes it re-learn quicker, in case you installed a battery that has a different capacity. However, this also will cause the alternator to overcharge a battery that's been in use for a while, at least for a few weeks while it learns the actual capacity. Especially since it's likely never been fully charging your battery to begin with, since it wasn't reset before! This is why you only do the state of charge reset. What this makes it do its this: A modern car always draws some small amount of power from the battery while parked, to retain things like the clock setting, seat and radio memory, trip odometer, and many other things. When you do the state of charge reset, the BMS will keep track of how high the battery voltage is when you lock the car, and continuously monitor both how much current is drawn and how far the voltage drops. It can then use that info to calculate approximately what the actual capacity of the battery is, and it'll over-write the learned info in its memory with that and use it as the starting point for adapting over time, instead of whatever useless number it had from the previous battery that was totally exhausted.",Volvo

"Oof, everyone I know including myself only drive diesel cars",Volvo
"This is great info.  I no longer have this car, but when I did, I was one of those dummies who replaced the battery and thought little more of the BMS than ""what the hell is this weird thing in the way that's making this job slightly more complicated?"" and never thought about it again.

Sure as shit, within a month I was seeing warnings that my battery was low... after doing nothing but sitting in the car for a few minutes with the radio on after a drive.

Had I but known!

Hope your post helps some folks!

The ADAS systems that are running in modern cars that do L2 and L3 work are very powerful - “Game Boy” doesn’t even begin to describe it. Nor does “console”. These things are dramatically more powerful than your PS5. 

Tesla doesn’t have an exclusive on having high-compute ADAS systems. More to the point though - Tesla’s system architecture *will never lead to L3 or L4 autonomy* specifically because they insist on a visible light camera only system.

There’s a reason the EX90 has LIDAR, and all actual autonomous systems that work (see: Waymo, Cruise) also use the same. 

The MB L3 system works only in very limited circumstances because it only *works reliably* in those circumstances. FSD on the other hand *does not reliably work at all* in many circumstances where Tesla advertises it to work.

"If you do your presentation, not having to plug your phone in to use Carplay is a benefit.

Doing this in a walk around gets rid of this feedback from other luxury brand customers.

&#x200B;

It's all about how you present it, and making sure that you are touching on all the customers hot buttons. I was selling Porsche in 2017 and 2018 while I was literally next door to a MB deal, a block away from Audi, and half a mile away from BMW. Porsche's tech at that point was behind the other brands, and we were much more expensive. I rarely ever lost a deal from someone cross shopping those brands.

&#x200B;

But anyways, we established that Volvo's styling is timeless (which I agree, I mean just look at all the brands starting to copy the tail light design Volvo has been doing for literally decades), that the tech is new (just needs explaining/presenting correctly), our Phev lineup is 2nd to none, we have the safest brand there is, and the brand is more focused on the environment than on profits. So I ask again, in what way is Volvo behind?

"I would second that. Our last Jeep was surprisingly  disappointing in the snow. When we got an Audi afterwards it was shocking how much better it was. Our Audi S5 even on worn tires was better than our Jeep with new tires. Granted our Jeep was a V6 so only had Quadra-Trac I and not the Quadra-Drive V8s got which probably would have helped. When the Jeep got stuck in the snow (which happened more than once in New England storms), we couldn’t even rock it out because the transmission was so dumb and slow it couldn’t quickly shift from drive to reverse and back. We never had winter tires on either car and only ever stock AS Goodyear Forterras on our Jeep.

Personally I’d suggest the OP check their existing all-season tires for treadlife as well as the road conditions. If the plows get ahead of the storm, the roads aren’t bad, your tread isn’t bad and you take it cautiously as it’s a new car with new dynamics for you to learn you could probably do it. I’d suggest just doing a local drive first to see how it behaves. The latest Volvo AWD system is incredible but tires and road conditions are the limiting factor. In the future would recommend replacing the stock all-seasons with either winters or (assuming that’s what the car has) with severe snow service rated all seasons like the Michelin CrossClimate 2s which is a killer all-season that actually has good snow traction.",Volvo

Also you will not find a manual s60 unless it's an R, there isn't anything wrong with the autos, at least from my experience",Volvo
"Very good point, Most of my current customers are loving what Volvo is doing but our goal is to gain market share and venture out of our current bubble and in order to do that we need to show we are a force to reckon with in the luxury space.",Volvo
That’s a key for a Thule accessory like a roof box or rack,Volvo
"You’ve had your car more than a month you definitely don’t have it. It just released. It is not like a regular rearview mirror, it has a camera added inside the rear windshield.  It’s a big, crisp, wide, digital image, rear facing.",Volvo
This isn’t a good deal at all. There’s 0 dealer discount. At least shoot for 4-6%. Plenty of SoCal dealers to pit against each other. I got 9% off my XC60 T8 in December from a Virginia dealer,Volvo
Where do they find these sales people? How do they sleep at night?,Volvo
"Oh, sorry didint understand from your first comment. Not sure depends if the lock malfunction affects it too.",Volvo
46 year old male. Bought one last year. My “friends” call me Soccer Mom now lol,Volvo
"I like these R wheels much better than the Tethys wheels. Tethys are kinda boring. Nebula wheels are cool.

I personally have the Orpheus wheels on my S60, looks pretty good too.",Volvo
"The standard Volvo sound system is nearly as good as the Harman Kardon sound system? 

You’re probably the only one who thinks that.

On topic: OP, I recently bought a V60 Cross County MY2020 (I know you said CC is not an option) and I’m very happy with it because it’s perfect for me, my wife and 2,5 year old son. The HK sound system is my favorite part.

But, I live in northern Sweden and the downside is it feels like 99% of Swedes drive Volvo, especially V60/V90",Volvo
"Cheaper to buy oil than an engine, never hurts to be safe and just do it sooner",Volvo
"Also, unscented baby wipes were a miracle cleaner for our blonde leather s80 interior and wiped away all our kids and dog threw at it. They removed dirt, grime, food, and even the ballpoint pen marks left by our little ones (we had a long talk after that one) with barely any effort. Just use them sparingly, clean and condition your leather regularly and you will have buttery smooth and pillowy soft leather seats for the long run. YMMV, but for us it was the best cheat code ever for having light colored leather seats and kids.",Volvo
"Your Volvo tells you combined numbers, not actual breakdowns. That would be like if you car was the most efficient EV on the market by a huge margin, and also a Prius when in gas mode.

It can't actually tell you a breakdown very well because it would be complicated with regen, times when both are active, etc. It makes sense that it says the combined numbers, but the combined numbers don't actually represent efficiency.",Volvo
Both great cars!,Volvo
"Does she want a taller car? V60 Cross Country
Does she think you need more space? V90 it is.

"Got it, I mean the core is not usually given to us anyways so it makes sense.",Volvo
"My work colleague has xc70 with the same engine and it’s just turned 350km.

Sweden tends to have very high mileage cars as there is essentially one motorway road from the north to the south and all roads tend to run off that.",Volvo
"Looks clean, Time for some mods! I would definitely recommend doing an exhaust, intercooler and tune at the minimum. It makes the car drive so much better and the throttle response is much more fun.",Volvo
"I believe the issue comes down to the magnet being part of the shifter blind itself, and the blind being made of plastic that is really fragile. As far as I know, there's no real way to repair it. I'd just get a new shifter blind as you'd have to open the whole thing up anyway.",Volvo
"Probably not significant ,but that bag is retro af!",Volvo
I bought my first one in 1969 while in high school. I delivered pizza 7 evenings a week and saved every available penny. It was a 1970 122S in bright red. I’m almost 75 now and Volvos are all I’ve ever driven. Currently in a 23 V90CC with Polestar. My wife of 42 years has a 17 V60CC and won’t part with it. Best seats in the entire industry.,Volvo
There are really only two tuners in the business i'd trust. Hilton tuning is pretty much the only one left. I used Contrast (urbas tuning) but apparently he closed up shop and didn't finish people's tunes from what I'm reading online which is really unfortunate. I had a really good experience.,Volvo

"As a Sales Manager at a Volvo dealer who currently has a 2022 XC60 T8 R-Design, I don't see it.

What are you seeing that your customers also see that is making them move to other brands? We rarely lose business to other brands from cross shopping.

In what ways is Volvo behind? EV's? We have 2 models with 2 more by the end of the year. Phev's? We have some of the best plug in hybrids available and have it in almost all models.

Mhev? Everything that's not EV or Phev is Mhev now. what other brand has 100% of their current lineup like that?

Build quality? Volvo is one of the best when it comes to build quality. And I say that as someone who's spent a good part of my career with Porsche. High quality materials, the fit and finish is great. Not a lot of plastic that makes loud crunch sounds when pressed (looking at MB and BMW specifically on that one).

Performance? Have you really stepped on it in a XC40 Recharge or C40 Recharge? Those things MOVE! And then even the Phev is a 455hp beast that also gets great fuel economy. 

Road noise? We don't use run flat tires and use great materials, so road noise is not bad in our vehicles.

So really, in what way is Volvo behind?",Volvo
Could be a faulty or loose valve stem.,Volvo
I am in the US and 2023 only had b6,Volvo
"I know these cars well. Something tells me... Better than you do. Could be wrong.   
The latest trend is to scare people into these warranties. Bottom line as a fucking rabid Volvo fan boy: if I have to buy a warranty for a car... I bought the wrong car. And your car is like top of the top for reliability. Your headlight is a fluke and I'll bet you $100 you won't need another one in 2 years after this one.  
Invest the $1,000 or 2.",Volvo
"This is what I use it for too, really saves the brakes and keeps the rotors from warping.",Volvo
Thanks! Yeah the color is sneaky - it looks fine in photos but is really pretty in person.,Volvo
"So far, a full 18.5gal tank(premium) lasts about two to three weeks with daily city driving at 15-20mpg(~270-370mi range).",Volvo
"The autobox in my opinion is perhaps the worst aspect of P2 Volvos, at least if you enjoy driving in a spirited manner. I feel like the box is often one gear too high. Just cruising on the freeway that’s a good thing, but if you want to quickly overtake and need to goose it, it’s helpful to be able to drop a gear rather than pressing the gas and waiting for the transmission to realize that maybe it should be shifting down. It’s also vaguely more engaging than just letting the auto do its thing.",Volvo
"Polestar wasn’t available when we bought our 22.5. It is now but still haven’t gotten it…we’re in Pure unless we’re on a road trip and even in Hybrid it’s silly fast for a family SUV. Will I someday get Polestar because I’m immature and have too much disposable income? Yeah. Will I pay list price at that point? Also, yeah. It’s a $75k+ car, not a hill to die on.",Volvo

"I agree with you 100%.  Some of the low hanging fruits they should have addressed:  
1. wireless carplay.  Some people like Google map, but I personally like Apple map

2. Faster onboard charger.  It's already available in EU, why not make it available for the US

3. Vegan leather steering wheel.  I have sweaty hands and I find the vegan leather gets slippery.

Some of the harder one to address (but most of the competitors have them):

AAOS needs more customization.  Simple things like having a clock on in the instrument cluster to more customize info like music info, oil temperature, odometer, etc (I know I am beating the dead horse)

Better 360 camera.  Certain situation it's almost not usable.

Convenience features like automatic lock/unlock as you walk away/approach the car.",Volvo

$1430 for 40k service 18’ V60 CC at local CT dealer. Local specialist landed at $830.,Volvo

"Probably a good idea! ""Trust but verify"" is a phrase I've learned the hard way through my job. Check the depth yourself with a caliper or one of those digital thread measuring tools just to be on the safe side. I don't know what the rules are where you live but here in Sweden summer tyres need a minimum of 1,6mm and winter tyres a minimum or 3mm. But check you local laws and regulations.",Volvo
I'd like to see a full electric v60 (not PHEV),Volvo
"I just do maintenance myself personally (former dealer tech, bit easy to me) a 40k is the cabin air filter, engine air filter and oil and filter, things I can do in less then 30 minutes.  the break and coolant flush is suggested but most customers skip it to save.  No way I’m paying 200+ an hour on labor when the most the tech will see is 15-20 as a junior tech an hour and 45+ as a master tech.  Most of the money you pay goes straight to the dealership.  Didn’t sit right with me when I was working there, still doesn’t today",Volvo
Where do you guys get deals like that?. Go for 2018 btw,Volvo
Just glossing right over us P2 folks…I see how it is.,Volvo

"Probably? This is literally the first time I've heard of a Volvo headlight needing replacement. And it's probably?... right now. So may not. And oh, look at that... It dies while under warranty? Like most things do.  
Waste of money, friend. Don't  believe the bullshit that you have to have a warranty. My car has 70K on it. Still on the original headlights. So you're gambling you might need a 3rd?  
That's not remotely normal.

"Yeah the $7500 federal tax credit is only available by leasing, and this month volvo is offering an incentive on recharge leases which has been between $9500 and $11,000 when i have cross shopped dealerships. 

Honestly this is also so confusing to me I think i am leaning back towards just buying the B6 and financing it. Those numbers i understand.",Volvo
"I rarely lose a deal when it comes to both of those objections, it’s more of customer feedback as well as capturing other luxury brand customers. My market is very competitive as right next to me is Audi, BMW, and a Mercedes dealer 2 miles away. With current Volvo customers I retain their business very well.",Volvo
Congrats and excellent choice!,Volvo
When going up icy hills you don’t want the auto to have to shift since you then loose power and momentum,Volvo
"Probably, or they use that as an excuse. When I picked up my '22 XC60 Inscription at the factory in Sweden, I was a bit miffed that it didn't have the massage seats that I swear the '21 had. I asked the sales rep and he blamed parts shortage (early 2022).",Volvo
"But...you can always sell the customer on the safety, right? 😆",Volvo
"If the dealership offers some kind of services, or ""guaranteed evaluated"" used? I'd go with dealership. I'd trust anyone that's worried about reputation than off the street.

If you're not hurting in cash and can afford to throw away near $2,000 or at least be ready to reflip it. I don't trust anyone that's gutted so much stuff without some type of reputable shade tree history.",Volvo
"This is what I did for my 99, got a 2.5T from a s60 06. Never let me down and at 300,000 miles it got a s60r engine and R goodies",Volvo

Haha ok thanks 🙃,Volvo
I'm 19 and Bought my s60 2006 off my dad for 3000😂 so it's pretty accurate,Volvo
I didn’t need a bigger car when my C30 died for me. Volvo didn’t have a car I want. 4 in a row but it was my last Volvo.,Volvo
"In the future, I wouldn't buy from any dealership. 

Use rock auto, IPD, fcp euro, or similar, and find good quality parts. They're significantly cheaper than dealerships... Most of the time.",Volvo
This would be my answer.,Volvo
17.5 mpg and about every 2 weeks. It's worth it for the V8 noise.,Volvo
"Interesting! I'm not too versed on what Audi looks like. The first one looks like a Dodge to me, for some reason, but I can't figure out why. It looks a little like the Dodge ram truck from mid 1990s in the front. I thought there might be a SUV from Dodge that looks like this too, but then I searched online and couldn't find it any.  The side profile resembles the late 90s, early 2000s Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV.",Volvo
I was really confused why your airbags went off but after reading that makes sense especially if it took your car airborne !,Volvo
"I have the 2023 XC60 B6 after upgrading from the 2020 XC60 T6. We have two kids (6 and 4) and a Labrador.

I prefer the B6 to the T6 and feel like the mild hybrid is heads and shoulders above the old T6. The Android automotive is ok and getting better with each release. 

I looked at the XC90 but it didn’t work for us because of us having car seats and the somewhat primitive rear seat arrangement. 

The Volvo is more affordable than the Merc, Audi or BMW and the size of the XC60 is better for us than the X3, GLC, Q5. 

Your sales being up must tell you that Volvo are doing something right. If you want innovation you buy a Tesla or Polestar or something like that - people who buy Volvos aren’t looking for cutting edge. They’re looking for a solid car that is different from the boring BMWs, Mercs and Audis everyone else is driving.",Volvo
Key battery and vehicle battery are different alerts on the car. Vehicle battery sensor needs to be reset through VIDA or a scan tool (not the cheap ones) every time the car battery is replaced. Key battery alert will go away if you change the key battery. Keeping it further from the car has no effect on how long the battery lasts.,Volvo
Complete sleeper lol. Race it 😉,Volvo
"The answer when they ask is no. Everything recommended is covered, therefore anything they suggest is not recommended.

I moved and brought my 10 yo G35 6,t into the new dealer for a service, the assholes tried to sell me a clutch replacement, warning me it was about to go, they can tell. Nope, been driving shitty cars with Manuals for 20 years, I know exactly what it feels like and how far past reasonable I can push it. about 60k miles and 7 years later I sold it and teh clutch was still strong enough to smoke the tires. Last time I used that dealer, I went to local shops after that.",Volvo
"Overfill your gas tank? Couple extras squeezes after the handle pops can give a strong petroleum smell, kinda goes away when you start driving.",Volvo
"UPDATE: Drove through the storm! Got up early and it hadn’t snowed much so driving to the hill so it wasn’t too extreme. I was stuck behind trucks and tractor trailers who were going slow a lot of the time.  
  
On the way home it was very snowy, had snowed 20inches. The roads were plowed but it was snowing at 1.5 inches a hr.  
  
The tires I had were okay but overall the Volvo performed better than I had thought. The biggest issue with the tires were that I had bad stopping distances. When going straight I felt secure but if I had a down hill curve I would slow down extra to be safe.  
  
One thing I noticed was that when driving 50 in slush there was a lot of vibration coming from the wheel, sometimes. It seemed as if it was programmed to do it. Is this true? Was is due to th way the road was plowed? Was I driving on the rumble strip in the middle of the road?  
  
  
I am very impressed with the way the Volvo performed. With winter tires on next season I will confidently be able to travel around in snow storms.  


I acknowledge I need winter tires. But if this type of storm happened again I would be confident I could get to the mtn. Excited for winter tires next year.

"I’ve got a crystal white one in stock right now and an onyx Black coming in about two weeks… Dealership is located across from the airport. You can fly in on allegiant for 75 Bucks. I’ll pick you up in it at the airport, test drive and then take it home.",Volvo
"this complaint about the drive mode is such nonsense. You can easily locate the settings button in the bottom right corner with your finger without looking. You tap in the corner of the screen and driving dynamics is the top bar on the setting screen. Tap the top of the setting screen and then the modes are the very top line in that menu. It’s literally two taps to get you where you want. 

I totally agree that the drive mode click wheel was awesome. But as the owner of a 2021 Sensus car and I drive and demo 2024’s all day every day… The improvements of the google system over Sensus are so profound that the button doesn’t even register.",Volvo

It's not actually..Volvo uses a speed and balance system to make sure tires are inflated correctly. It's stupid...always use tire gage to check or stop at a gas station real quick and the air pumps will tell you,Volvo

Got it! I was thinking this was less “policy” and more something to do with benefits to them.

"Also manual can be very useful when towing. The trans always wants the highest gear possible for best fuel economy, but with a several thousand pound trailer behind you, the last thing you want is the poor transmission trying to shift up just to realize it needs to be back down a gear.

"That seems like a pretty high residual 2-years out, which is where you're getting screwed.  Generally, lease costs should reflect the depreciation of the vehicle over the term you're leasing - in this case the residual appears to be quite high, so the difference (e.g. the extra 11k) is benefit to someone else.  

There is often a small fee to 'break' the lease; you should confirm what that is - it should be somewhere in the lease agreement.

  
If you buy-out the lease after three months, you're on the hook to finance the balance based on the value at the date you've initiated the buy-out;  unless you have that sitting in cash, you'll need to borrow and will be paying interest on that balance.

Curious though - why are you intending to buy the lease out after 3 months?  Why not just finance the vehicle from the get-go.  What you're proposing is a finance with extra steps.",Volvo

Mercedes and BMW are killing themselves with their new horrendous designs. I love how Volvos look and am not bored with the design yet,Volvo
"Yes, I think it can make a pretty big difference. I want to do this if I can save 7k or so at a minimum. Getting all the info you need is like pulling teeth.",Volvo
"The brackets are (usually) steel, the calipers are aluminum.

Also, look again... The big piece is the caliper itself. It fits around the bracket, which is essentially the same as the bracket used with the much smaller caliper. All of the caliper material that's located outside of the bracket is literally just ""excess"" aluminum. Including that big arc that's below the tension spring... It's part of the caliper too. This same caliper design is used on the BMW 7 series as well... And yes, it's ATE, though TRW is an alternate supplier for them (you know that's probably what you have when the slide pins are a 9mm hex instead of 7 like the ATE ones are Because 9mm hex sockets are so common...)

One of the big problems with overheated brakes is that it causes the brake fluid to boil. A large aluminum caliper most definitely will help with that.

It also probably provides vibration damping as well. Actually, that may be its primary function here. But the caliper most definitely acts as a heat sink for the brake fluid.",Volvo
Good to know I’m not alone! I have a catback exhaust so did it for the sound at first. Now it’s basic maintenance haha. I think it’s easier to stay in the power band in the R or base models using the shifter as well.. not that this is always needed,Volvo
"I got an XC 90 and was a little embarrassed because they’re big “mom” cars here.  My brother, the sports car aficionado, pointed out that Volvo makes racing engines, too.  That made me feel better.  Then I owned it for a while and fell in love.  Now shopping for my next Volvo.",Volvo
Yep,Volvo
"I do wish they would show the XC90 some love. Especially inside. The dashboard is showing its age, especially the center stack/display + air vents. Even if they just incorporated a refresh to mirror the XC60s dash, it would be a vast improvement. Exterior wise there isn’t a lot I would change. Maybe add the dark theme as an option, some additional paint colors, updated grille, etc.",Volvo
"I don't get why there are so many regular V60 CC in stock and almost no V60 Polestars, are they really affected by batteries shortages that much? It has been like that for years now. And why they don't lift the V60 polestars into CC variant.",Volvo
"This is what’s called managing a mature, complete product. As others have pointed out, Volvo is not subscribing to the annual facelifting model, changing things just for the sake of refreshing the appeal of their product to new customers / push existing ones into FOMO to get an influx of sales. They are a smaller manufacturer than the Toyotas of this world, this comes with certain characteristics in their strategy. Their products have a long lifecycle, with small incremental changes throughout the lifespan, which actually allows them to add iterative polish to the already well-designed product. The often-ridiculed choice of 4 cyl. 2.0 liter engines at the core of the SPA generation means that customers are given a refined, mature ICE unit, where infancy issues have long been resolved. 

Safety-wise (especially passive) - Volvo has been ahead of the game for a while now due to the safety-led design process & conscious material selection.

Infotainment tech from circa 2015 was updated slightly around 2018,and then brought on par with the market with the AAOS implementation, which is a massive improvement over Sensus with the recent OTA updates. It also makes the cars relatively future-proof (much more than Sensus, which is now in its sunset period). 

In terms of screen size, which seems to be the holy grail for many - the fact that Volvo’s center screen is embedded into the overall dash design rather tacked on, as in most of the competitor offerings, is a big positive in my book. Never have I felt that more screen real estate is needed in my Volvo, and the look of the cockpit brings a smile to my face literally everyday. 

Exterior design is subjective; suffice to say that Volvos exteriors and interiors are quite timeless in their restraint and continue to be fresh (maybe aside from the look of the XC90’s central air vent design, which is a bit of an outlier in the SPA lineup). 

All of this is one of the many reasons that make Volvo really different in the current market (albeit cost discipline is the great equalizer for all automakers). I’d assume a Volvo sales rep. would understand these idiosyncrasies and guide the customer / educate them on the value proposition here. That said, I imagine it would be hard to convince someone with the „M-B has bigger screens and more ambient lights” mindset. And that’s fine too, there’s surely something in the market for every taste.

The EV lineup is slowly coming, before new products other then EX30 hit the dealerships, there’s plenty of Volvo value in the current generation.",Volvo

"If it's the low oil PRESSURE light (the red one with the small can and a drop):

STOP THE ENGINE IMMEDIATELY.

Don't ever drive with low oil pressure, if you even drive a mile after that light comes on, stuff will get really hot and damaged. Even if it doesn't stall out right there and then, there will be permanent damage to the head, cylinder walls, crank journals, and piston rings.

Low oil pressure is *bad*. You can run an engine for a few minutes without coolant in an emergency, but running without oil is near-instant death.",Volvo

"We went through the same debate (leave or stay with volvo) in 2022 and again last month. 

We were at the point that we were ready to get out of our V60 and wanted a plug in hybrid. We considered several, and narrowed it down to either the S60 or a Toyota RAV4 Prime. Ultimately we went with the S60 because the interior just wasn’t anything comparable with the  RAV4. I don’t regret it for a second! I LOVE my S60 Recharge. 

So then earlier this year we were ready to get rid of our old faithful XC90. We considered several SUVs. We considered Acura, the smaller Ford Bronco, a Lexus, but what caught our attention the most was Mazda. So we went and looked at the CX-5 and the CX-50. We went and drove them both and decided the CX-50 was our favorite. We were SO close to buying it, but decided to just go check out what our Volvo dealer had on the lot since we were less than a mile away. We ended up walking out the owners of a XC40. 

My advice… narrow down your options/vehicles you are considering and then go drive them. Drive your favorite and then go drive the Volvo model you are considering. The decision was SO easy when we did this.",Volvo

""Small SUV"" are we talking XC40 size? Because that has less space and less room in the back, so you'll have less space for a child seat and it'll be more cumbersome to get the kid and/or seat in and out.

XC60 has kindof the same leg room length wise as the V60 but more height. For a child seat the difference doesn't mean anything really.",Volvo

"what state are you in? There’s a huge variance between how much and when you paid the sales tax. ie: South Carolina sales tax isall due upfront when you originate the lease but it’s capped at $500. if you’re in New York State, you’re going to pay like 11% sales tax. In Illinois you have to pay 9.5% sales tax and it’s due upfront. North Carolina sales taxes only 3% and split over all lease payments  

in most cases (including my state), the value of your trade is reduced from the sticker price of the car and lowers the transactional amount that you have to pay sales tax on later at the buyout stage",Volvo

"alternatively, if want good useable power, and your an off the shelf kind of guy, there are a number of ways to go about it. get a good plenum, watermelon helps but not necessary, ported lower mani, 3” inlet and exhaust, and for the turbo, many people have gone with the k16. it’s pricey but is a bit bigger then the stock k04. there are also hybrid options available, that fit in the stock manifold. k16/k04 hybrid will get close to 400bhp and you don’t need internal mods for that.  my c30 has a stage 1 hybrid turbo, and i’m very happy with it. probably around 300hp and honestly for a daily it’s plenty. very useable, no lag.. i may do water/meth in the future, but overall im content with the power it makes. especially from a reliability standpoint. i drove a 500hp R and it was a fun car for sure, but had no power below 5k. if you needed to accelerate out of a situation, and you were in the wrong gear you’d be screwed lol. good for track use tho. to get past the 4-500hp mark, your gonna need a standalone ecu. factory unit can be reflashed to a certain point, but 4-500 seems to be the limitation. additionally, most tuners don’t change vvt timing, i read one standalone tuner pulled 80hp from vvt tuning alone on a t5. wild.",Volvo

"Leases have two ways of completing, you make all your payments or if you have a total insurance loss (wrecked or stolen) there is a table called “Stipulated Loss” somewhere in your documents where it has your buyout at every payment made.

"EDIT: numbers/clarity

When you buy out your lease, you have to make all of the remaining lease payments PLUS buy the vehicle for the residual price listed, but MINUS the amount of interest you'd pay in your remaining lease payments.

So in short, if you bought the car AT THE END of the lease you'd pay total:

$3,500 Down Payment  
$42,768 for 36 lease payments of $1,188  
$49,203 for residual value of vehicle  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
\~$95,471 total

If you buy out EARLIER, there is an amortized amount of interest over the lease you won't have to pay, but they will have to give you those numbers.

There are some more doc fees and extras involved with buying out as well, but it's not a lot.

They don’t mention anything about your trade in but I would assume that’s worth about $20k.",Volvo

"I’m at 28,000 miles on a 2019 S60. It’s technically 5 years old almost and they suggested I do the 40K. Anyone know if it’s too soon? Was thinking of waiting till 35K at least, also 850 bucks.",Volvo

i thought it was a nice backdrop,Volvo
"That's a totally reasonable price and it looks to be in pretty good nick. Truth is that the 850 market is just a bit niche so a lot of cars sit for a while before getting sold - at least that's how it is in Australia, even Rs can take 6-12 months to sell here.",Volvo
"Seriously - what's so bad about AAOS? watching the videos, reviews, etc. it seems like AAOS is a clear winner, and the future.",Volvo
Dealer replaced mine under warranty when they weren't working,Volvo
