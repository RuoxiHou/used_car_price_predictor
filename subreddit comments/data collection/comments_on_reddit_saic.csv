Being a scholar is fairly selective. It basically just means you get to spend a few weeks in Italy with the other scholars and some faculty. The additional aid is to offset travel cost though. It's 3k if I remember correctly. If you're worried about additional costs maybe don't accept it. 3k isn't really enough for a trip to Italy. Unless they feed and house you as well. Have you spoken with an admissions councilor about it at all?,saic
