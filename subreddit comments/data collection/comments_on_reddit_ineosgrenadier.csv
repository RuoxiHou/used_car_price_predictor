Ouch,ineosgrenadier
"I kinda like the LC, but not sold on the hybrid part yet.  My head says it’ll work fine and be reliable (and possibly better for most things), but it just doesn’t sing to me and it makes the back load floor so high.  If it had another drivetrain option I might feel different.  The Lexus seems closer, probably a little posher than I’d like, but if the same cost as a Gren, well that is a very compelling case for me.  I love the Gren, and still have an order, but continue looking at options.  I’m curious about what the 4 Runner might be.",ineosgrenadier
Thanks.,ineosgrenadier
No. In Northern California.,ineosgrenadier
Not me,ineosgrenadier
"I'll say this - there's a difference between not caring, and using it like a tool. I don't expect to keep mine perfect, nor am I planning on doing dumb stuff to break it. But, if not used off road, I would not be interested in the car. Obviously, that's just me, and no judgement intended if you don't plan on wheeling yours. 

I think of it like a power tool - its going to do some hard work and get some scuffs and dings in the course of its service, but, I'm not going to just drop it off ladders to find out what it can take, either.",ineosgrenadier
I’ll take one thanks,ineosgrenadier
"I really wanted a front winch, but wow it is expensive. I'm guessing there will be an aftermarket adapter soon enough, but if not, I'll just have a local metal shop drill out an adapter plate.",ineosgrenadier
"Everyone says that but there is zero data to support it yet.  What's robust to you? How thick an axel is?  There can be serious reliability issues based on the wiring hanging down, rust, etc.",ineosgrenadier
Lame,ineosgrenadier
It's for MY24.  Brought the ROW price to US price.  I wish I had the ability to buy it at MY23 prices but wasn't available yet for US.  People missed out on a massive deal.,ineosgrenadier
"I have a Wrangler too. Believe me, I know !",ineosgrenadier
"My issue has been the cramped back row - from my first time in the vehicle, I’m 6’0” and 220. I was ok in the driver seat but it felt tight. Overall for me, I think it’s a pass. Next step is figuring out how to get my deposit back.",ineosgrenadier
The GX is in the same category if it has an 8k tow rating.,ineosgrenadier
I really like the Donny Grey. It’s dark (and looks black in some lights) but a bit more interesting than the black. To me at least. Hope you enjoy whatever you pick!,ineosgrenadier
"Like any SUV of it's style of horrible wind noise.... But tbh it stacks pretty well compared to Jeep Wrangler or Bronco but not G class level in anyway..... Also having all of these systems issues I get worried on using the Cruise Control lol and it gets stuck on me somehow, it's not a car that gives confident, I expected a car that's Lexus GX level of confidence where you don't have to worry about reliability or issues and it can be taken everywhere but so far it's not... I hope some 3rd party upgrades will fix this car issues for me",ineosgrenadier
He is doing it because of the other one selling for 110k.   He didn't make reserve on cars and bids.  The guy owns a G wagon and something else.  Bought the IG but says he is selling it because it won't fit I to his garage.  He is trying to sell it to make a profit.,ineosgrenadier
This is me. Close dealership. Every other car I’m looking at is the same price or money (just general inflation of nice SUVs at this point). So I’m going with the unique one.,ineosgrenadier
Not that anyone who buys one of these cares but I laughed when I saw the MPG numbers. 15 city 15 highway 15 combined! Lol!! Ineos is a petroleum company so money right back in their pocket ;),ineosgrenadier
"From the dealer today.  My page also says Q1 of 2024, but dealer had previously stated December 2023 or January 2024.",ineosgrenadier
I’m not a fan of the carpet either however one thing I’ve seen is the carpet actually hides some of the rough finishing of the hard flooring. Either way not as functional and funny enough carpet actually is an option with additional cost.,ineosgrenadier
**Thanks for showing up!**,ineosgrenadier
"That’s fine, thank you. We’re looking at the new hybrid, truth be told 90% of our driving is rural and city. Most off road is dirt roads in ranch country or so called city/highway driving. For me a quiet highway cabin and robust A/C is what I need most for Texas. It’s already nosing up to 100 degrees and it’s still June. We’ve not hit full summer yet. I’ve had some bad experiences with brand new model vehicles so I’m on the fence with a vehicle from a new manufacturer and no service network. The last thing I want is a mechanic saying “I’ve never seen one of these before”, kind of like a surgeon saying “you’re my first”.",ineosgrenadier
apparently u-turns,ineosgrenadier
"If you are a reservation holder, the dealer is not allowed to mess with you since you are a factory customer, per my discussion with corporate. Rest assured, no dealer is going to mess with a corporate customer, so have no worries about markups and the like (this applies only to reservation holders).",ineosgrenadier
Looks awesome,ineosgrenadier
"No didn’t do the safari windows. All seals fail eventually. Didn’t want to deal with that later. I also have tons of trees on my property that drop branches going full speed like a missile. My other vehicles have seen the results, reason I did the roof rack.",ineosgrenadier
Do you have links to this? Would be curious to read more about the real-world experience.,ineosgrenadier
I'm waiting for that LC Prado announcement. It has potential to be a great option.,ineosgrenadier
"It happens all the time it’s just we don’t really pay attention enough. Here are some price drops in 2023 alone from just ten manufacturers. https://money.com/new-car-prices-drop-2023/?amp=true

The other thing is, if the grenadier is suppose to be a forever car and people do decided to move on. The pricing will be more desirable on the second hand market if there is depreciation.",ineosgrenadier
"Looking up BMW (because why not and Germany is close enough to ineos???), its 45-90 days to delivery from build start (barring supply chain issues). This makes sense to me. I've been quoted under 6 weeks to build + luck of the draw on shipping availability.",ineosgrenadier
I like the steelies. Wish they offered them with the Fieldmaster package.  To me the green was a no-brainer for this vehicle.,ineosgrenadier
This was always going to get bad mileage. All the old school construction and steel.,ineosgrenadier
"KM3s are pretty nice on dry pavement for an MT. They're like any other MT in that they struggle when it's cold and wet on packed ice or hard surfaces. Where I really like them is at speed in the desert, the Baja heritage is no joke. Of course they're also great in sand, mud, and rocks.",ineosgrenadier
Does the RHD hump effect the passenger much?,ineosgrenadier
Nice! How much if you don’t mind me asking and which dealer?,ineosgrenadier
"Dude stop, it’s in the UAE, for Muslims it is illegal to take out a loan with interest.",ineosgrenadier
Just purchased at Curry and was able to negotiate a few grand off.  As you pointed out accessories were a part of that (credit for those).,ineosgrenadier
"Every pickup in Europe (and most in Africa and Asia-Pacific) is Ford Ranger sized or smaller, and has *at least* a tow rating of 6500lbs and payload of 2200lbs. It's not difficult.",ineosgrenadier
"I was thinking the cream color would look the best! The more and more I see, actually green looks the best.",ineosgrenadier
"New '24 Tacoma Off-Road and a 3 series for your DD. 

I don't know what to suggest if you have passengers that need to sit in the rear.",ineosgrenadier
"Your not going to get much more of a ""stripped down"" version than the standard station wagon Grenadier. 

People just can't be pleased. If you take a standard SW and don't tick any boxes, you get less equipment than most mid size pickup trucks. No active safety gizmos, no heated seats, no heated steering wheel, no leather, steel wheels.... what exactly would you like stripped out? 
Most of the things ASPW brought up don't affect price at all. Its cheaper to just offer one brand of seat (recaro)  as opposed to 2 options, complicating manufacturing. The fact is the price comes from the strength and engineering quality of the components used, not the features in the cabin. Look at how well equipped all the Chinese trucks and SUVs are... tech and gizmos are not expensive anymore. What is expensive is quality. Which ineos have achieved.

The 70 series that Andrew so worships has loads of rubbish parts from the factory that need swapping out immediately to make the thing liveable. These are legacy parts from decades ago when the thing was designed. 

INEOS had the opportunity to start with a clean slate and make a workhorse for the 21st century. 

Mine is a daily driver, working vehicle and adventure tourer. Its fantastic, and while not perfect, is just what I want out of a 4wd. 5000 miles on the clock already offroad and towing 3.5ton",ineosgrenadier
"It looks awesome but I'm waiting for a price before getting excited. I just came here for the announcement. The world doesn't need another $60k+ EV or hybrid. Which is why Jeep is slashing prices.

If it is relatively affordable it's on my list as a range extended EV.",ineosgrenadier
White or magic mushroom?,ineosgrenadier
"Not TRAILmaster, it’s TRIALmaster",ineosgrenadier
"The whole Grenadier process and people has been fascinating to watch.  Value keeps coming up in many people's comments here and other social media locations.  It seems to me that as a society, we have embraced that everything is equal.   I call this the amazon effect.   It's not just this vehicle, but I also see it in-house, purchases,  investments, and even insurance.  The broad assumption is that something of equal looks should equate to the same price.  

When you look at the Grenadier, you are getting a Gwagon 2.0 for half the price.  The underpinnings are twice the size of any stock offroader.   You are getting a Recaro seats standard, which again you have to buy aftermarket.  But yet people will say I can buy a 2024 Lexus GX for less money.  The last time I checked, the true pricing has not been announced.  The so-called leaked has ranged from 67k to 87k.  The current GX460 starts 62k for pretty base model.  You could buy a base Grenadier for 72k.  The point I'm making is that the idea of value is really not the value of the dollar but the value you expect for your dollar.  To me, most people stated they wanted a bare bones vehicle that you can repair on the side of the road with minimum electronic intrusion.  In reality, they wanted a lot more refinement and luxury but the ability to take it off road.  

Two comments stick out to me.  Premium gas, the low mpg, and the requirement to put in premium gas is mind-boggling.  Currently people are averaging 18 to 20 mpg in their petrol engine. Yes the calculation has been done for US mpg.    The 15mpg number has been proven false.   I currently drive a 2020  brick with 4cylinder that weighs 5500 pounds and I am getting 21 on highway and 15 to 18 in city.  What about premium gas? Well most European engines require premium gas.  In reality the Grenadier fuel door says recommend 91 but minimum of 87.  

Electronics, I think people are starting to realize that they like or require more of the driver assisted tech than they originally thought they needed.  People have complained about no heated steering wheel, no adaptive cruise control, no heated windshield.  Less is more has been the ethos of the Grenadier and has not changed but when it was time has come to gave the piper they are backingout because they realize that maybe the nice to haves are necessities now

One last thing, Ineos has stated that if you do work on vehicle outside your service, keep the receipts and you will still be under warranty",ineosgrenadier
"It wins pure road reliability, but the Grenadier will be more robust for offroad or heavy work abuse",ineosgrenadier
" Nice rig. I see you got the red bikini frame 😂

Kidding. I like it. It’s an expensive item to spec but good on ya. Drive it in good health",ineosgrenadier
Had them on an Avalanche as well. Very slick.,ineosgrenadier
"I just got a call from my local dealer. He told me Nov 23 build date, expected delivery second half of Q1.",ineosgrenadier
"Overtrail MSRP is just under $68k, $69k when including delivery. Overtrail+ is $77k including delivery.",ineosgrenadier
"I do a lot of ranch work. The proposition of dealers being a forced intermediary is insult to injury.  Im sending in my cancel on my reservation this week. There are a few brands where its been no hassle and wicked smooth, but most are bad. 

They slowrolled the market and raised prices with inflation.",ineosgrenadier
Rhymes with Grenadier.,ineosgrenadier
This is definitely pulling me back into Grenadier after cancelling the the first day reservation of the og gren.. Waiting until price announcement so that I can peacefully get out.,ineosgrenadier
"Thought I'd post this after seeing the roof loading discussion. I made some spacers to distribute the pressure across the roof guttering. It's taking the weight absolutely fine, although I will be fitting a rack down the line.",ineosgrenadier
I can tell you those issues are in all vehicles now. The same sensors in one are in the other. My GMC Sierra was lemon lawed over it and my sisters suburban has been in the shop constantly meanwhile my Discovery TD6 has only had two issues.,ineosgrenadier
Gonna offroad it?,ineosgrenadier
"Yeah I've always liked them. They're made very well, a friend of mine uses them on his race truck, he's abused them and they've held up brilliant. They're made in Spain unlike most aftermarket wheels that are made in China",ineosgrenadier
"But it's true. INEOS at first said they would push for dealers to honor MSRP on pre orders, but then they reversed their stance on this saying the dealers are independent and they simply hope they won't do it.",ineosgrenadier
"Yeah, I understand that, but I guess what I was wondering is whether the December 2023 trucks will be 2023 models, or 2024 models, and if the latter, will there be differences between the 2023 spec from EMEA/APAC vs the spec in the US?  Looks like we just don’t know.",ineosgrenadier
"Ah, good point. Yes, I am reservation holder pre-order :)",ineosgrenadier
It did thank you.,ineosgrenadier
Welcome,ineosgrenadier
I heard from my dealer last week shortly after placing my pre-order. He informed they were setting up shop and were expecting demo models in November.,ineosgrenadier
"Apparently it's easy to switch it back and forth between the RAI and the standard configuration. It bolts on and off. So if you order one from the dealer you can probably pop it on yourself, or wait until a proper snorkel comes out, which should be easy to install.",ineosgrenadier
"They’ve had several returns to the dealer due to drivetrain issues. Ineos Grenadier forum and Facebook owners group. What does America have to do with anything? If they tacked on 30% tomorrow to your order you’d be fine? I’ve already placed my order but you idiots saying it’s a good price or is more robust or more capable are all full of shit because there’s not a single one that’s made it’s first oil change, I haven’t seen a single one that’s done anything I haven’t been doing in other vehicles, and we haven’t seen how Ineos customer service works. Break down do you get a loaner? Unknown. Does it qualify for lemon laws since it’s a low volume production, unknown. You guys hyping it so hard are just fooling yourselves and trying to make yourselves feel better. The company isn’t perfect and the vast majority of people in America feel taken for granted. We’re allowed to talk about. Ineos reads these groups. They need to know our satisfaction level.  If it bothers you so much why don’t you leave and go to your own countries page?",ineosgrenadier
"I think the rules state that if they were imported they have to issue a recall so it is tracked through distribution. I read the nhtsa recall, it looks like a fairly minor recall to me.",ineosgrenadier
0% interest?,ineosgrenadier
Pretty sus that ineos is offering a 0 percent financing. If it’s in Europe which is a year out already. Would mean that the cars have sold to initial buyers and now are having too many cars in the lots or not selling for whatever reasons. Probably foreshadowing of what is gonna happen here unless it’s better received. So might be better to wait for the initial deliveries.,ineosgrenadier
No.  I think you are most of us.  Good on the road is important too.,ineosgrenadier
"That would be amazing, more is always better. I hope you had a great Xmas and have a fantastic New Year! And never be shy to share what you are up to with your Grenadier. I and the rest of the team love seeing how people use theirs.",ineosgrenadier
"Honestly it was smooth, not too loud. As mentioned, way better than Jeep IMO. My highway time was only 5min or so and I want to go drive it again, but it was better than expected. I went to test drive thinking, ok, this will push me away from the idea of buying this badass looking beast. I think people are over reacting to steering, the solid axles do make me wish it had airbags. As many of us will be driving these long distances to get to camping/off road areas.",ineosgrenadier
"Agreed on this.   It’s why I cancelled.  The value line eclipsed the price at 65k especially given the simplicity of the car and where it started in price.  The fact that Ineos decided to fuck the US with a huge premium is because of people above with more money than sense.

Edit: stupid autocorrect still changes Ineos to India",ineosgrenadier
"But if it costs the same as the Grenadier that could be tricky, they say they're going to release a car smaller again that is possibly a crossover. I'm guessing it'll be a freelander type thing and that might end up being the cash cow, but they'll still have to get the price right.",ineosgrenadier
sounds like a full size truck would better suit your needs,ineosgrenadier
"Does Toyota have a model that can compete with it?  Lexus has the GX but that hasn’t hit the market yet.

Could be an employee bought one and the company wants to take a look at it.  It will be interesting to see if something pops up in the next few years.",ineosgrenadier
Looks really nice!,ineosgrenadier
Might want to wait for the new Landcruiser.,ineosgrenadier
"Yes it’s my first defender, and first premium brand vehicle.

I’ve had it for about 2,500 miles now. Only compliant is the Land Rover glass is brittle af so if you are going 80mph on the highway be prepared for a window chip in a situation where any other vehicle the window would be fine.

I frankly love it. I got the base model on coil springs, it’s nice ride, definitely enough speed and space for me. Feels like a full size pick up truck inside and out.

The auto start stop was obviously designed for the p400 hybrid engine, so I turn it off in my p300. Cycling that starter for a negligible amount of gas ain’t worth it for me",ineosgrenadier
"The local dealer had 6 out front so I stopped to look. Then saw 4 around the side. Then a double row of eight (16).  Then four more here and there. So maybe 30-35?  All marked SOLD except for two. I couldn’t believe it, the more I kept walking around the side and back lot, the more I saw.",ineosgrenadier
"I am also here , I believe it was mossy I got a call from them on Saturday morning",ineosgrenadier
"Note a bad review. To me the car eclipsed my expectations. I drove the trialmaster.
I thought the steering was decent. I wish it had adaptive cruise control with lane centering but I'll take what it had. My test unit has a bit of electrical issues with errors from seat belts, difficulty getting into 4wd etc. I hear most of that is fixed in the latest sw update.

I think of the gren as a bit of a blank slate. I look forward to outfitting it. But I was pleasantly surprised by how roomy it was and how much interior space there is. Seats where good but I would have expected electric seat control in this price class.",ineosgrenadier
What if you died b4 the 5 years was up.,ineosgrenadier
You need a bull bar and some lights! Looks good!,ineosgrenadier
I’m leaning towards the new Lexus GX550. Maybe slightly less capable but right now they’re about $15k less expensive and you get so much more for your money in terms of a comfortable driving experience,ineosgrenadier
Nope,ineosgrenadier
"This is quite entertaining and informative. I do wonder about the QA process given the oversight with the mudflap installation. 

More concerning is the exposed wiring under car. In parts of Australia, red clay can cake around such exposed wires, dry, fall off and take the wiring with it. 

Nitpicking perhaps, but could be a show stopper in the middle of nowhere.",ineosgrenadier
All I see is underbite.,ineosgrenadier
"I will suggest to wait for a better variants from the car, it does have potential but it's alot of work that in my opinion need to be done, at its current state it's I can't say it's better than Land Rover Defender or G class..... Some will like it but majority won't specially the ones came from G class or defender... Compromises are big in this one",ineosgrenadier
Does anyone know what east coast port these are coming through? I’ve seen them on a trailer heading from Savannah towards Atlanta in the last few weeks. Wondered if port of Savannah or Brunswick.,ineosgrenadier
Inky Black with the red frame is a great look!,ineosgrenadier
"This is great and all, but what would be really cool is if they delivered my original order that was supposed to be here Q4 2023.",ineosgrenadier
Is that Scottish White or Magic Mushroom? My screen isn't quite good enough to tell.,ineosgrenadier
"there is that grumpy old Australian youtuber that says the new defender sucks because it has electronics, doesnt have a ladder frame, and isnt solid front axle. But i wouldnt take his word because hes upset with the grenadier because the price, the electronics, and because ineos wouldnt give him one or give one him one early. 

TFL has done quite a few reviews on the defender though. Based on their review, i would say its equally as capable for 99% of off roaders.",ineosgrenadier
What firw hazard recall?  What's thay?,ineosgrenadier
"I had an issue initially where I couldn't submit my pre-order (reservation paid), and it took 4 phone calls, about a dozen or so emails, and they still couldn't figure out what was happening or how to fix it... and there was no cohesive communication from the team.  If they can't get simple logistics like this figured out, then I don't have confidence that they'll get these out on time.  Even if they do, not sure how I feel about spending 80k with this company anymore.  I've officially cancelled.",ineosgrenadier
Nah a wrangler or gladiator with the 6.4 in it for that price. Dudes are just salty they paid 85k for a knock off land cruiser,ineosgrenadier
So funny thing. Their gallon is 20% more than the US. So their mpg figures looked much better.,ineosgrenadier
Were the roads paved all the way?,ineosgrenadier
"I have done the same.  Been following since the very beginning and would’ve received in December 18th.  They called me to announce my Scottish white field master had arrived but the numbers just didn’t add up for me.  It’s available at the Greensboro,NC dealership for anyone interested.  A 2024 Land Cruiser is its possible replacement.  Fills up all my needs with less $$ and more serviceability.  Eventually a Grenadier is in my future but surely 2nd hand…",ineosgrenadier
"Same numbers quoted for the Tacoma, so I’m betting the power figures are final.",ineosgrenadier
I sent my pre-order in today and I don't really care how long it takes.,ineosgrenadier
Also any info on a good snorkel option for the grenadier? I don’t really need a raised air intake.,ineosgrenadier
You can buy a porche not the same but probably just as fun and better as a daily,ineosgrenadier
Did you update the shocks yourself or was that removed for cleaning.  Explain those pictures,ineosgrenadier
I am! Been in contact with Ashton Mossy about events,ineosgrenadier
Appreciate it. Assuming these came off the Tarago? One of those white ones are min.,ineosgrenadier

Looks like 20% which is what I have on my cars. 👍🏼,ineosgrenadier
good looks! it's that the privacy glass the way it comes from the factory?,ineosgrenadier
"5.94% from BofA through the dealer.  Ineos pushes Santander for financing which is not competitive.  At all.  They were 9.4%. You may even get a better rate from BofA if you already have accounts with them, I don’t.  And local credit unions are likely to offer really good rates.",ineosgrenadier
Haha brilliant 👏,ineosgrenadier
I can think of several reasons including fuel economy and or national highway safety foundation requirements for crash testing. It's an interesting question hopefully someone can give us a more concise answer.,ineosgrenadier
"They held and fixed the US Trialmasters before they went out, so I'm surprised there is a recall. Maybe a couple got by.",ineosgrenadier
Check put Robert pepper youtube review.  Currently he took the grenadier vs his Nissan patrol ans a old discovery.  He is planning on doing a test against the LC300 and the New Defender.  All these cars are from friends and not manufacture so he tends to be harder on them offroad than if the car was given from the manufacture.,ineosgrenadier
"It's like getting engaged to be married. Yr friends tell you that you are a fool. You can reverse out, but there is a lot of emotional pressure from yr potential new in-laws, not to do so.",ineosgrenadier
"Weird to see it at first cause I been staring at the Grenadier for so long. But it's starting to grow on me. It appears to be more compact, windows look tiny.  My guess is unibody design for it to be energy efficient. Kinda has the shape of a Jeep Liberty.",ineosgrenadier
"If you are in the Toronto area, the Grenadier will be here for a test drive on May 26th.",ineosgrenadier

"Dave, you and I go back a long way. Track down his post history and take a look for yourself. He is fighting with everyone, for no reason. Numerous people have told him to leave, yet he still sticks around talking trash.

Yup. Aware. Bummed.,ineosgrenadier
"We have G500 as well at home and I will say it's slightly worse than G class does, I need to measure numbers first tbh, didn't do that yet",ineosgrenadier
They were great. I paid cash so no idea on financing or leases. Paid msrp. No deals or discounts on these.  Too many people in line.,ineosgrenadier
"A Wrangler (Rubicon anyway) is a lot more capable. Maybe the ones in the UK are dumbed down. It has better approach and departure angles. It's better protected underneath. The suspension can articulate more, and more freely (disconnecting swaybar). It has bigger tires. It's lighter and has a better power to weight ratio. It has a better turning radius and it's narrower. This bit is subjective but the jeep has more direct and immediate brake and throttle response, which I find gives me more control than when I drove a Grenadier off-road. 

In the US we use our jeeps hard. Even new and unmodified. 

No disrespect to the Grenadier, it has a different set of strengths outside of technical offroading capability.",ineosgrenadier
Love mine,ineosgrenadier

Land Rovers and Range Rovers are such an attraction for thieves getting insurance is becoming a problem,ineosgrenadier
The GX has a V6. The LC is a hybrid I4. Other than that they have the same underpinnings. It's a world car that is sold as the Land cruiser Prado everywhere other than the US with different engine options.,ineosgrenadier
"Yep, I been following from day one, and the mission to launch it at that price range and got lost along the way. It's also hard to justify when the interior is one of the cheapest things I have ever seen at that price range. Except for the center console wheel and front seats.",ineosgrenadier
"Incidentally, in Boulder, CO, I had the lexus dealer say that the GX550 already had a ""likely 1 year wait list"", and that current lexus owners from that dealer had priority orders.

After all the griping about the ineos timeframe, I suspect that I may actually get an ineos a year before I could get the GX.",ineosgrenadier
When I see one I’m going to shamelessly ask to drive it. Dealer is 5 hrs away…,ineosgrenadier
"Are you asking for what my configuration total cost came out too?
Or 
Are you asking what I finally paid as I go to pick up my vehicle? 

I put the small deposit down like everyone 3yrs ago. I figured the Grenadier would cost between 50-70 thousand so I started saving 3yrs ago. 

I am therefore only financing 40,000.  Which is a steal. I planned ahead. 

As to my full configuration price, you can check the Grenadier online configuration with the options I listed above.  
I presume you know the Grenadier costs.",ineosgrenadier
205 a month full coverage 500 deductible. State Farm in south tx. And we have a multi vehicle/home discount.,ineosgrenadier
Just buy a 200 or 300 series land cruiser instead.,ineosgrenadier
"Yeah I would agree with that, I was hoping that intro pricing was going to be around $65k, and fully specced around $80k. For the price now, I'm thinking I can basically get myself a pretty nice mid-size pickup (frontier or ranger) for $45k, and my wife maybe a civic hatch for $35k, for the price of the grenadier...",ineosgrenadier
"What are your comparable vehicles, though? 

I totally agree on rock crawling, BTW. I'm not likely to do  very much of that as a primary objective. I like having the capabilities for backcountry roads, but I'm not likely to take a 6500 lb car to crawl the rubicon just for fun. 

I fully agree that it is expensive, and the 20% upcharge from the rest of the world is a serious disappointment, especially to initial reservation holders. I was hoping that my $450 interest free loan to them would be worth more than a place in line. 

I can't figure the defender as a real competitor. it's very luxury, and you still need to swap wheels, tires, and suspension components to get what you get on the IG. it also doesn't really have lockers. if it works for you, great. 

the Bronco, OTOH is definitely a solid choice off road. cost can be less than the IG, size is very comparable, and the interior is more luxurious. It is a MUCH lighter vehicle, though, and people are definitely breaking the control arms, steering racks, and other components off road. It also can tow only 3500lbs. 

IMO, I think Ineos very nearly missed their market, but, didn't really make a plaything for the rich, either. I suspect that a lux trim version will be quite likely in the future. I genuinely wonder if they had too many orders for their exemptions and just had to price it in a way to cut the order book down to comply with rules.",ineosgrenadier

Traction control based lockers are really nothing more than fancy ABS in most vehicles.  It works really well,  but when you want precision even with a wheel in the air,  traction control doesn't cut it.  Another factor is the amount of wear associated with those systems.  They typically require a certain minimum wheel speed,  which can be dangerous to you and/or your vehicle. They smoke your brakes too.  The clutch based differential systems are more effective,  but typically have the same wheel speed differential thresholds etc.",ineosgrenadier

There's barely an oil change on a Grenadier yet, it's a bit naive to say it's more robust at this point.",ineosgrenadier
"The Grenadier lends itself to better resale than the Def in my opinion. More tech, and many buyers who keep their vehicles for the 3 year warranty period then sell on.

People here keep saying everything is justified because of how reliable and robust it is; I'm pointing out there hasn't even been an oil change yet so pipe down. For all you know this thing is full of problem.   


There seems to be a few people here. One being the crowd that's practical and will actually use the thing (that's me).  Another being the people that spec out a jeep or tacoma and look all off-road capable but never leave asphalt. And yet another that are buying it for looks/nostalgia and telling themselves things are justified because of this or that. That last group seems to get their feelings hurt when you say something isn't perfect.  They want to tell you it's much more robust and reliable. Which is a complete joke because no one here knows. I'm not complaining about it's reliability I'm saying people using it as a talking point have no fucking clue what they're talking about because no one has yet to use one for any duration for any sort of actual work that matters. Every video or post is someone on a grass lawn or dirt road so spare me thinking that's what robust is. Go watch Top Gear's ""Killing a Toyota"". That's robust.  Truth is I haven't crossed paths with a single person yet that actually uses a vehicle for anything more than what we have ranching but they want to tell me this is more robust.  It's like people are lying to themselves. Trying to not have buyers remorse before they even get it. I'm realistic with my expectations and I have two orders in.

"So the roof it self is capable of supporting weight as it has rubber strips to protect the paint so things can be strapped down directly to the roof. I believe you can walk on it. I saw a video where someone was considering using bars or just a different roof rack then what ineos was going to provide. As the rhino rack was way to heavy and would eat away at the static and dynamic weight maximums. Specially when you add a roof tent on top and some accessories. 

It is interesting to see that flex on the gutter. I was curious about that when I first saw the design. Might be why the rack you can get from factory has like 8 points of contact to distribute the weight.",ineosgrenadier

"yes. solid axles and proper ladder frames are always superior to independent suspension and unibody. even if they don't show in the spec numbers, it will matter greatly for the vehicles' longevity and ability to repair and modify.

Not sure if you've been offroad to see the differences between independent suspension and solid axles, but solid axles are far superior on technical terrain. A solid axle vehicle can articulate way more and is much more balanced. And when the going gets really rough, you can ""send"" a solid axle vehicle in ways that would obliterate the independent suspension tie rods and axle shafts, and also not have to worry about causing damage to the unibody.  


The defender uses some good tricks. As a wheel rises, it can force the opposing wheel down to mimic a solid axle. It has good traction management. These are not substitutes for true 4x4 components, however. You do not want to have to rely on air suspension and electronic tricks when your life could depend on it.",ineosgrenadier

"Loved my cayenne. I had an older model but the engine gave out at 300k km lol. Had to sell it for parts just before I got the grenadier. I personally wouldn’t say the grenadier is loud on highways, but I’m comparing it to Supercars that I’ve owned and driven. Those were loud. Driving the grenadier is super comfortable, I’d go as far as saying it’s one of the most comfortables cars I’ve driven. Even better than a cayenne. The driving position is just superior with the seats they put in. Of course the steering is not as sharp and precise like in a porsche cayenne, but I got used to it after about 50km",ineosgrenadier
"Update - my dealer let me know that as of last week (Jan 8th), my “new” build was completed and ready for vessel assignment.

Not bad in my book…",ineosgrenadier

"You are asking a question that is gonna be pretty bias in this sub. But I’ll start by saying that the approach to these two mentioned vehicles are completely different. Which puts people into two camps. Traditional off road enthusiasts, and modern off-roaders. The new defenders have been out for 3 years now and taken off-roading all over the world. People have had a lot of success and as well as horror stories of issues and warranty claims and failed engines. Honestly this is the stuff you read from almost every car brand. The ineos despite doing a million miles internal testing. It hasn’t had a a real world track record. So far people say the performance and the drive is great and that the equipment that they used should be rugged and durable. Everything long term is hypothetical. There have been lots of electrical issues, warning lights for critical things that the company is saying to ignore till the next update that hasn’t happened yet. I personally fear that their goal of using as little electronics as possible might have have led them to not pay as much attention to the computer components. So much of the parts are sourced from third parties and not developed internally. That things aren’t working together seamlessly. It’s still a modern car and will have issues with sensors and monitoring. It’s also difficult to know if and when a warning light is actually a valid concern. There is also the issue of repair and parts. Currently it’s difficult to get parts. But they were pretty confident in early promotion that you can get parts all over the world within 24-48hours which is not happening currently. Ineos will take a couple of years to grow their network and be able to handle warranties and parts. Look at Tesla, they been around for more then 20 years has a much larger market share and capital and their still having problems with repair and parts. Land Rover had some pandemic shortages but things are stabilizing and there is almost a dealer everywhere. I know this wasn’t short but I do think both vehicles are capable off-road for the majority of people and comes down to the individuals needs and plans for customization. But I believe that getting a grenadier right now. Is being accepting of the growing pains of ineos and endure the coming years of ownership with a brand new car company. Where as Land Rover there is an established status quo between brand and buyer that you would expect with paying for a vehicle at that price range.",ineosgrenadier
"I’m out as well. Been following since day 1 , drove off road last year and was blown away. I assumed  on road driving would be equal or better to previous 30 year old solid axel land rovers I’ve owned.. the fact is I was beyond displeased disappointed dismayed in on road performance. It drove like utv w Cvt not premium 4x4 w b58 and zf tranny. The fact is this is not a g wagon 2.0 it is a very niche product for true off roading.",ineosgrenadier

"Personally I like the seats. 5""10 200lb coming from a jeep, they're a big step up. I've done 12 hours straight in them, and lumbar support could be better, but far from the worst I've experienced. The heated seat function is also perhaps the most powerful I've ever sat in, could cook a chicken on setting 3 😆",ineosgrenadier
"You’re not paying more because of quality of parts. If that were the case then the cost in the US would match the rest of the world expect for shipping charges.  Ineos is simply upping the price because they really didn’t know what they were doing at first and didn’t realize how limited in sales volume they’d have to be in the US to stay under the regulatory limits. If it were the same price globally that’s be one thing but it isn’t. A Belstaff edition in the US is going to cost significantly more than the same edition anywhere else. The production cost is the same regardless of where it’s shipped. 

What’s funny is I’ve grown up working a 30k acre ranch in Texas where we best on vehicles more than anyone I’ve ever seen except for safari guides in Kenya/Tanzania. Same kind of road quality. But people want to lecture me on what does and doesn’t make it.  There has been ZERO proof yet of the reliability of these machines. There’s been a high percentage off issues with the drive train already. If you want to believe the hype of a YouTube video go for it. But there’s been bugs and issues. No knows how the square frame will handle the constant vibrations of dirt roads, they don’t know where the fail points will be yet when loaded. Anyway your argument doesn’t hold any water because if it did the cost would change between countries, just the taxes, etc.",ineosgrenadier

"That last hit reminded me of a 300 series landcruiser review I watched. The ""reviewer"" said if you were getting a 300 to go off road in you'd have to get the GR Sport (the tip spec version) as it's the only model that came with diff lockers because he got his review car bogged going through mud.

He played the video of the mud. He was driving in wheel tracks of a car with way bugger tyres and the 300 bottomed out. He even got defensive and argued with commmenters that pointed out even with locked wheels, the you still need the wheel to touch the ground to have traction.",ineosgrenadier

"I took delivery of mine last Monday.  It arrived in port of Baltimore on 11/9.  The ADAS issue you are mentioning is not delaying any deliveries.  It is a warning chirping when you exceed posted speed limit that must be manually disabled on each drive.  There are a few reasons for the delays from port to dealers:  tow hitches…must be removed prior to transport to dealers due to software issue.  Also, an issue with aux power and winches may delay transport.  Each port seems to need to coordinate with personnel to sort these prior to transport to dealers hence the delays.  Some ports are doing better than others.  The other issue it the delivery of the MCO (Manufacturers Certificate or Origin) must be delivered to the dealers before they can hand the trucks over to the customers.  Some dealers have dozens on trucks on their lots that they cannot handover until they receive the MCOs.",ineosgrenadier

I'm also having some real dramas with ineos over my vehicle right now, so I'm questioning customer service, and seriously thinking whether I need to pull the pin. Im supposed to be May build, I asked for one small after market change which I was told wouldn't be an issue, it's now been a month and I've heard nothing despite reaching out a few times.

"Maybe, but if dealers don't pay, their best plan is to hold price at MSRP.  Once discounts start, they are hard to stop, and they damage the brand.  Dealers are better off with higher prices if it doesn't cost them anything. 

They might need some marketing.   I can not overstate how many like the car and have no idea what an Ineos is.",ineosgrenadier
"I use mine to get to climbing locations that are off the beaten path.   That means long stretches of highway and rough dirt roads that haven’t been traveled in a while.  I absolutely love my truck.  Comfort on the highway and on the trail.  I went from 2015 Rubicon Unlimited to the Grenadier and it is head and shoulders above the Rubicon in so many ways.  

If you do decide to get the Grenadier I would recommend getting front and rear lockers, I don’t know why one wouldn’t if they intend to use it off road.   The heated seats are a must for my sore back and appreciated.   

I look for excuses to drive mine, no complaints other than the heel dragging by Ineos to fix the tow hitch issue but other than that I love it.",ineosgrenadier
"There's nothing particularly ""magic"" about the suspension. Basically, you have to design for three factors: weight, strength, and use case (i.e. offroading vs daily driver vs towing vs bed load.) There are some different styles/types of suspension which again feed back into which is the best use case.

Where Ineos has done a great job is identifying that offroad is the primary case but also thinking about daily drivers. With their R&D the weight/strength may be then optimized, but they are using pretty hefty parts for all of that, which you need for durability + travel offroad.

This was always something I had as a headscratcher - why in the US do trucks with leaf springs in the back get advertised as offroaders, if that design is really for towing/bed load (my old F150 'felt' way better when it had some bags of concrete in the back.) That said, I know the old Defenders and LR Series prior had leaf springs, but that was due to simplification and needing load capacity instead of ride comfort.",ineosgrenadier

"From what I understand, that was their original intent. Price it low enough so that everyone could have one, and redefine everything about off roading affordability and performance. However, there are very many bells and whistles that are required by the department of transportation here in the US that are not necessary in other parts of the world. For example, we have to have the sensors for both parking assist and crash anticipation that will deploy airbags. When I got my vehicle, I was presuming that they were going to have notifications on the mirrors regarding occupied lanes and turning viability, but they do not. They do, however, have lane departure features that I still haven’t figured out yet and an annoying speed bell that clicks when you are over the speed limit. I, genuinely, believed that we turned that damn thing off before the guys left my house. These requirements, and other BS requirements drove up the price around $12-$14,000 from what I’ve read. That may be part of the cause. It definitely wasn’t the toot horn, though. Lol",ineosgrenadier

"The sum of its components even the good stuff that’s hidden doesn’t add up. Whatever it is it’s passed on to the buyer. Thats the first edition enthusiast tax I guess.

Any electric variant will have to be a weight saving unibody. Which will piss some old school people off. But that’s a whole other thing. But they will need variety and options to survive. As for cheaper cars with poor build quality. I would agree and disagree depends on the car.

"Just had this conversation with the ATL dealer and was told the same thing.  

It’s a tough call - this is a pricey vehicle, especially consider what it lacks compared to others on the market, so I can certainly see the allure that others see when considering similar vehicles.  I should be competitive for low(er) rates, but at this point it’s more a matter of principle.  Rough math based on current APRs indicates that I will be paying a few hundred dollars more per month for the “privilege” of borrowing money to finance, and that additional money will equate to another small car payment.  It’s hard for me to justify spending an additional ~$20k on a vehicle by the time my loan term is up.  Thinking I’ll go ahead with the build until I get the financing options and make my decision then.  I may be out the $450, and while it would be nice to have that back if I don’t purchase the vehicle, I can’t really argue that I’m “missing” that cash, since it’s been gone for a while.

I’d love to see them offer something below the market, but I’m not counting on it.  There are a few articles claiming that interest rates should start dropping slowly over the next year, which doesn’t really help out us early adopters very much when our vehicles are supposed to be delivered in early-mid 2024.  Would be nice if they’d give us an introductory offer.",ineosgrenadier
"I've been having some discussions with the FB group folks on this topic since pricing was released. Overall I agree with your sentiment.

The issue I have is not that it's a 80-90k wagon for those with the disposable income, but rather the mismatch between it's positioning and the pricing. It was positioned as the antidote to the modern defender, bloated ""luxury"" suvs like the g wagon, and 200-300 series land cruiser. It was positioned as a no-nonsense utilitarian wagon. The original price point was supposed to be sub 50k.

If the price of a well equipped ineos was 60k I may be able to stomach it considering what I feel like I'm getting, but it's still a huge risk for a brand new manufacture. I don't care who it was designed by, at the end of the day the electronics are gonna have all the german gremlins that they always do, and the rest will have growing pains.

Like to like, I'd rather have a comfortable cruising SUV/sedan and a legit off-roader like a wrangler, bronco, 4runner, taco, ranger, colorado, power wagon, etc. For a well equipped ineos I could buy two of the above and still have some cash left over. It's not even close.",ineosgrenadier

"He’s provocative and opinionated to get views.  He has a valid point to make the vehicle cheaper and more accessible, but no manufacturer can do that right out of the gate with their only premium vehicle.  Ineos needs money quickly to be even remotely solvent.  Sucks to be an early adopter, but thems the breaks.  Maybe after they prove the vehicle’s viablity, then maybe Ineos can release a stripper vehicle for the budget minded.  Ineos also has a problem of releasing a vehicle in the age that there are many, many regulatory and safety requirements that are expensive to accommodate, both electronic and structural.  It’s impossible to build a flimsy, analog vehicle like the original defender for international sale.  Yes this car is more $$ than it probably should be, but I think a lot of the issue is not with Ineos, but with the international regulatory community that demands much more that an off roader really needs just to go camping.  I don’t think this bloke gives enough credence to those imposed hurdles. 

Also, he harps a lot on a manufacturer providing all of the accessories a la JLR.  I do not see his point related to Ineos.  I think Ineos has worked with many 3rd party suppliers to get some products on the market sooner and to be provided by their dealers.  They have_not_provided proprietary items, and have gone out of there way to build a platform for _anyone_to build accessories and provide CAD support to these manufacturers.  This is a bald-faced misrepresentation by ASPW in my opinion.  Ineos wants this 3rd party support as much as the off-road community does.",ineosgrenadier

"What I’m more curious about is the cooling used for the ZF transmission. The only time I ever stuck I discovery was pounding through a marsh when it suddenly told me it was restricting power due to the transmission heating up. It’s the one gripe I have about my Disco. I can remedy it adding a second cooler but you shouldn’t have to do that. Really want to see a Grenadier in knee deep mud being mashed on and see if the ZF throws a code in it or not. Where I’m at our off roading is black land mud, creek crossings, etc. as great as the ZF is to people it’s the only transmission that’s stranded me. I’d rather the decision be up to me on when to call it quits even if that means blowing parts out the bottom. Sometimes it’s a real safety issue to stop. In my case the disco started sinking but luckily I had a tractor a half mile away we went and got with about 300yrds of rope to pull it out. I’d have rather it overheat but keep driving and break when it hit dry ground.  Funny party was Land Rover took it and said they’d never actually seen anyone use it like that, cleaned about 400lbs of mud out of the undercarriage, took photos, then detailed it and gave it back free of charge.

"What $89K vehicle is better? I think it's a better value than a restored $89K original Defender. I haven't seen the IG in person yet, but I have a NAS D90 and I can't imagine the plastics in the IG could be worse. All the plastics in the Defender are cheap & brittle and will crack just looking at them. The IG also probably won't suffer the rust issues of the Defender. You have to literally galvanize all the steel parts on an old Defender to prevent it from turning into a pile of rust. Many of the last Puma Defenders are now rust heaps. The chassis just rots from the inside out since there's no paint inside... same for the cappings and bulkhead.

Plus to swap in an engine as good as the B58 into a Defender would cost a fortune. I still love the old Defender and I plan to keep mine, but I wouldn't buy one over an IG unless it's a body style you can't get like the 90 soft top.",ineosgrenadier

"I ended up getting a new defender based on the price. Dollar to dollar it made more sense for me. I love the look of the grenadier over the new defender. But the new defender hands down is way better built interior build quality. It’s way more refined and better designed. The grenadier has a cool unique retro take on the controls. The switches, steering wheel and the front seats are high quality but the rest of the interior and build quality feels really cheap cheaper than anything I have seen since the 90’s. Panels cut short in places exposed plastic edges. Rear seats are cheap. The view of the front windshield took some getting used to at first on how short it was. And most likely the reason they didn’t have a front gauge cluster to give more visibility. All due to the front slope of the roof line. So the safari windows are a must to feel less claustrophobic in the front seat. The passenger seat foot well has that bump. The car was clearly designed from the outside in. And the interior has low priority. The door design is very basic and hard plastic with no soft touch.  The defender feels extremely roomy all around as well as the foot well. And the seats are extremely luxurious with way finer control and movement. The grenadier has more of a sporty seat really hugs. But also just the manual tilt and slide forward and back. A very little thing but kinda a major consideration for me is a car with usb ports. The grenadier I think has 1 or 2 where as the defender has at least 4 and a wireless phone charger. Just more options to connect equipment with out having to alter anything. Just odd for a modern car not to have these things. Considering grenadier understood how important the smartphone would be or external instruments. 

The drive of the grenadier definitely made off roading easy. yes, it felt more like a tractor sounded like a tractor. I was only able to take it off-road on the test drive and can say it made a rainy muddy day really easy to drive. I can’t say how it would do at speed as we couldn’t take it up to speed. For the new defender I have taken it off-road but not as extreme yet as the test course for the grenadier. I will later this spring. But I assume it will be fine based on all the footage out there. The defender I have is the p300 and the engine is perfectly adequate for how I drive. Probably still faster than the grenadier and better gas mileage. It has low gearing so the torque is nice. It also has the air suspension which makes the ride super nice and floaty but if you want more road feel you can put it down to normal height. Access height is really nice for the kids and loading things into the car. Probably one of the nicest driving experience I have ever had with a big vehicle. Way better audio in the new defender. 

The exterior clearly I think the grenadier wins. It looks amazing built really well for most things and you can see where the money went. With the protection of the frame the sound of the doors closing. Not that defender doesn’t sound good. But you just can tell on the grenadier it’s a heavy car. And will beat you up for your gas money. 

Overall I think that the grenadier missed the mark on a few things but a massive achievement for a first car. But they have a lot of things to work out and it just cost too much to pay for a car to go through that figuring out process with them. Considering I have a Land Rover dealership 10 minutes from my house. A car that has been improved now for three years for the new defender and built upon a history of making off roaders. The new defender for the average Joe like me is going to get more value. But if you off-road every weekend and live in a place with no paved roads. The grenadier is probably gonna be better suited. Good luck",ineosgrenadier
"I see we are talking past each other a bit. Europe has a very different tow rating system. It seems ineos has rated their trucks in a way that leaves the figures the same in American vs Europe, which means the numbers are lower than they could have been.

Yes those are usually promotions to move inventory and get cars sold that are sitting in lots. Or companies that have ramped up production and can see that that sales are slowing. So I doubt ineos will have that kind of deal. I would expect the worse hope for the best.,ineosgrenadier
Did those add offset?,ineosgrenadier
"That's sad, what do you have now?",ineosgrenadier
"The V8 had decent torque and was relatively snappy (given the weight of the vehicle) and on the freeway I'm typically going pretty fast so that also affects my mpg.  If the Ineos 14 mpg is close to EPA, then it'll certainly be even lower in real world speeds.  The new GX looks much more interesting to me and has much better (relatively) MPG (and lots more power and torque).",ineosgrenadier

"I feel like he totally misses the point of a vehicle for people who don’t want to have to think of a new car purchase as a “build”. I’ve done a lot of work to cars, but, I would have preferred factory engineered and tested options. I just don’t get his pov. The 70 series is terrible! It’s non viable in almost any market, and has a lot of aftermarket costs implicit in a build. The fact that ASPW doesn’t want to buy a finished car is his prerogative, but he goes very far to speak “for the community” for a guy who doesn’t appear to want any debate or input.",ineosgrenadier
"If not rock crawling then lockers on the Defender are more than adequate. It may be more plastic than people would like but I’ve watched them tackle very serious terrain and do more than I’d ever need. My discovery TD6 has been through more mud, creeks, hunting, etc than any commercial they use to advertise and I’ve had no issues getting through any of it. They can both tow 8300lbs.  As can other SUVs that again, won’t earn top marks for crawling, but can handle any trail. I’ve done mountain trails in Colorado where people have vehicles that look crazy they’ve dumped so much into them only to see a pickup with passengers drive by right after them. You can go to the most remote places in the world and find old school tacomas going around. Just like you see all these modded vehicles in the Rockies but someone else making a Subaru work.  There are many comparable vehicles but the same? No. The defender isn’t the same but as you said it has a lot of bells and whistles and does so cheaper. It’s turned out to be reliable now. The grenadier would survive a Tanzanian dirt road where I’d have no faith in a Land Rover with air ride suspension lasting more than a couple days being 41yrs old I’ve still never driven on roads like that so not sure what that’s my important selling point. My Discovery has done all I’ve ever asked of. I’ve towed 8k lbs from south east Louisiana to a couple hours south west of Houston and tow with it all the time. I’ve buried it up to its bumpers in a swap, driving it through waste deep water during flooding in a hurricane, I’ve never had a physical break of anything. I just had it’s electric shifter go out which was prob LH from me spilling a ton of drinks on it, design flaw, but people underestimate how robust a platform those are as well. Anything with an 8k tow rating isn’t going to be built cheap underneath. It’s needs to be able to handle the load factors.",ineosgrenadier

"Yeah, i mean, their record isn’t great for being “On time and under budget” lol. I think my reservation is Feb 2022, so we’ll see what our build slots are. But, our configuration still says 14mpg* with the little indicator that they haven’t had a production model rated. I’d bet money on a new software version or two by the time the US launches, but I wonder about engine tune and even hardware spec. Before they build the US versions, I hope they find a way to pull out 400 lbs and give me the ZF from the diesel spec so I can tune the B58 up a bit.",ineosgrenadier
"I didn't say it's the only thing but it is in the same category. It's an offroader, can tow as much, has a lot of internal space, what's the magical category you've created for the grenadier in that nothing else appears to be in?",ineosgrenadier

"From everything I’ve read the first US ones will start production in September after the summer factory shutdown as 2024 models.  My guess is that there won’t be any enhancements, but hopefully some minor tweaks based on issues collected from cars already on the road.  I haven’t heard of any specific US safety items, except that there will be different bumpers (smaller, maybe steel?) than the ones on the Europe spec.  

Like many have said, the communication hasn’t been great, but I think if they were adding something like lane detection or other safety features you’d see it in the configuration menu for the US website since that would be good marketing as well.",ineosgrenadier

It's progressed to now I'm told the issue is ADAS and the options are to replace it with one directly from Ineos or another cars ADAS on the lot if the Ineos engineering team recommends it.  From what I gather, the engineering team is currently stumped on how to fix the software.",ineosgrenadier
"Crew up with Defenders and drove one for many years myself. When Ineos first announced their car I was over the moon. I was a fanboy for sure. Now after what I have seen and read I am cured of this obsession. As I live in Canada now, I can only get the petrol version which has a starting price of $91,000 CAD. I am terrible sorry but that is just too much for a car that was assembled from different manufacturers parts bins and thrown together in France. For the same money I could by two Toyota Tacomas TRD or one decked out F350 or Silverado 3500 with massive Turbo Diesel producing just shy of 500BHP and can tow over 20,000lbs. The dream of owning a (classic) Defender like vehicle has come to a screeching halt. In the end the Grenadier will be nothing but a toy - boulevard off-roader for some old farts that cannot let go of their past. We will see where Ineos is with this vehicle in a  couple of years for now but I’ve got a feeling that many buyers will get de-illusioned before too long.
Too sad too bad.",ineosgrenadier

The GX was nice, but, the interior would be destroyed if you really wanted to use it for too much Utility. The Land Cruiser with cloth seats would be better, but because of the engine choices, you lose the tow rating.

"As an off-roader, the Grenadier’s primary advantage is that it has a solid front axle. Unfortunately, without the ability to disconnect the sway bars, that advantage is largely nullified. That’s something that can be easily be rectified by modification, but, in its stock form, the Grenadier unfortunately just cannot exploit its solid front axle.

Despite, having a solid front axle, the Grenadier is held back by a lot as well. Compared to many other options, it is definitely lacking in ground clearance. Again, modification can increase the ground clearance, but a stock Grenadier will lag behind other vehicles with better clearance. Unfortunately, there’s one thing that really can’t be changed meaningfully, and that is weight. The Grenadier is MASSIVE. Weight can be a huge deal off road, and a light enough vehicle can navigate some pretty harsh terrain with open differentials, while the same terrain may be impassable to a heavy enough vehicle, even with both axles locked. Its large size also makes it less maneuverable and is something that cannot be meaningfully changed.

The Grenadier is awesome, and I love it, but, realistically, it’s not going to be some game-changing off road vehicle straight off the factory floor. No vehicle really will be like that, with the exception of the Wrangler Rubicon, which, despite its namesake, still isn’t going to be capable of tackling trails of that caliber(not without taking some serious trail-damage) in its stock form. It is platform upon which to *build* an off roader, and that solid front axle gives it the potential to be a force to be reckoned with and may even rival something like a Wrangler if modified properly.",ineosgrenadier

"Im leaning away after my on road test drive too. 

It’s the adaptive cruise control i cant get over these days. In the states where you drive literally hundreds or thousands of miles for road trips, its a huge necessity for me now. Even base models Subaru and Toyota have them. I get the whole keeping it simple, but the price doesnt make it seem simple either. At 90k after everything is settled, ACC should be a standard feature now on all cars.

Other things that annoyed me was the knobs and buttons. The button itself feels great, but the physical pushing them in and getting the tactile feedback felt like i pushed in a mushed up pancake. The knobs felt cheap and disappointing. A 4runner felt more satisfying. 

The front seat surprisingly felt cramped on my left arm unless you used the perch and right knee couldn’t stretch laterally much. 

Its interesting you said the lease thing. I was starting to think either pick up a raptor with the amount of money that will be spent OR just wait out a few years and see how the used market will fair.

The Ineos space in the rear is deep bottom to top and probably as big as any other length-wise. My version has 2 slotted aircraft tiedown rails on the floor with adjustable hooks and 4 tiedown points on the sides. The only slightly annoying thing is that the wheel arches are sloped on top. Would have been better if they were flat. There's built in attachment points for a cargo barrier as well. The rear floor is hard, not carpet in the Ineos. Hope that helps some.",ineosgrenadier

1. that bump in RHD markets feels like a really dumb idea.
2. the steering is something that can be gotten used to. To me, it felt different but not bad. I guess i wish it had felt great.
3. feels glued to the ground and confident.
4. that rear big door latch location is dumb. I may apply engineering thought to changing it myself.
5. should have come on 33s - 285/70r17 feels like the obvious choice that many folks here are running.
6. fuel tank is smaller than ideal
7. side hill performance is good - COG is low.
8. payload is amazing, esp. compared to other vehicles that require payload-stealing mods to perform well.
9. HUD instrument auxiliary would have been nice.
10. for NA market at least, it should have come with a trailer brake controller.

ASPW identified some of this and hinted at other stuff.

With the success of the FJ cruiser in the aftermarket and the new Land Cruiser coming out in the US with more retro styling maybe they are going toward boxier styles.

"Another reply on lockers here. Given that the ineos front/rear lockers only work in low range, I suspect that they are a lot less useful in non-crawling scenarios. Snow, for one, is great to have lockers, but usually not needed to be in low range. The most “day to day” need for lockers IMO is boat ramps when the water level is a bit low so the ramp is slick and Fowled. 

For me, lockers are especially great when you max out your articulation and a wheel is in the air. When locked, that makes no difference. It’s also handy when one side of the vehicle is in a really low traction surface. E.g. a few years ago I pulled off the side of a road and had the right tires in slick mud and the left on pavement. Even in 4wd, basically all the power went to the slipping wheels. On the tundra, I had to activate the ALSD feature to get out, but having a locker would have solved that, too. The reliance on sensors and brakes to do ALSD is fine for most stuff but it is frustrating at time when you want the truck to do something it doesn’t want to do. 

The downside is that lockers weigh a bunch and will reduce payload, only work in low range, and only solve niche problems. 95% of the time you can’t use a front locker for more than a few feet anyway since you can’t turn while the front is locked.",ineosgrenadier

After seeing the GX announcement, I submitted a refund for my reservation as I can't justify spending $90k on the Grenadier despite that I prefer its looks, but the overall package looks much better with the GX (and probably even more so with the upcoming LC Prado in the US).  


I hope Ineos survives and I can reconsider in a year or two.  Not in a hurry to buy either anyways, but nice to see the GX/Prado being more than a mall cruiser.",ineosgrenadier

"Regarding the diff locks, are you talking about the new Defender? I don't believe it has a real differential and LR uses software (ECUs) to handle all of that. Ineos said they wanted to limit the number of ECUs in the car to make it easier to repair if you're stranded in the middle of nowhere like how the old Defender was.

I don't know how true this is and I haven't confirmed it but I read an article stating that the new Defender has sensors that worked with the ECU to handle the terrain. It stated that if the sensor were to get damaged or destroyed it would greatly affect the off road capability of the Defender.

"I got tired of the delays and not-fully-transparent information regarding US timing and pricing and dropped off just before the official US pricing and specs were announced.  No regrets jumping and would have been easier to do once the price goals were missed and the fuel economy announced.

Sure sure, this is a “safe” number pending EPA certification.  It ain’t gonna go up much.  And now hearing that premium is required when so much ballyhoo was made about their “custom retune for more torque that makes less power and torque but can run on regular unleaded”?

I bought a GMC Sierra AT4 with the LZ0 3.0 diesel.  It’s everything the Grenadier could have/should have been.  I regularly get 22 mpg in the daily grind in city traffic, 27 on my commute when I work late (don’t ask my wife how often that is lol), 30 on backroads, but falls to about 25-27 on the interstate at 75mph cruising.

Nevermind there’s a GMC and/Chevy dealer in every Podunk town.  And GM Finance gave me a great incentivized rate to help move product off lots during the peak of inflation back in March.

So beyond the 14 MPG, what are the purchase, finance, insurance, service costs and pain gonna be?  I really wanted a Grenadier badly.  My order number was 900002XX.

I wish Ineos and the buyers well.  They look amazing and seem to perform well.  Hopefully the business end - especially in the US gets sorted.",ineosgrenadier
What is it?,ineosgrenadier
"The grenadier is pretty close to other off-road comps. The bronco sasquatch 4 door is rated at 16 mpg and the Rubicon is rated at 19 mpg (but gets in practice 16-17). Given that the grenadier is bigger/beefier, it would make sense that the mileage is a tad worse.

If you're looking to tow, I would strongly recommend a diesel. There aren't a lot of offerings in the mid-sized SUV range (I would rec the ecodiesel on the Rubicon). However, if you're looking to tow 5500 lbs, you're going to need a longer wheelbase of a full-sized truck (could maybe get by with a ranger equivalent)",ineosgrenadier
"I have adaptive cruise control in my car today and have used it a handful of times the last 5 years. The lane assist I turn off as it's too aggressive to my liking as well.

Can’t decide between a Porsche Cayenne a vehicle I’ve had great experience with and this vehicle. I ordered one but honestly I’m leaning toward the hybrid Cayenne because most of my driving will be local (electric) and the V6 Turbo can handle anything else. The mileage they’re stating in the US is 15MPG which is pretty lousy. I’m also concerned about how quiet and comfortable the Grenadier is at highway speeds.,ineosgrenadier
"If the Land Cruiser were launching with a TRD pro package, maybe LC. As it stands, it would need a rack, tires, lift, shocks, etc, and I don’t really want to do that.

There are no recall for any safety systems which adas would fall under. I can't imagine there can be any defect identified in that system without a nhtsa report.

I wonder if this is a conflation of the EU mandatory over speed limit warning that Ineos decided to keep active in the US markets. That has a pretty decent consumer backlash in the US market where other manufacturers allow it to be disabled. I've heard reports that the system is confused in the California market where truck speeds for highways is mistaken for the speed the ineos should drive at. Complete speculation on my part though, I think the recall is more likely the issue creating any delays.",ineosgrenadier

Just cause news that comes up that you don’t agree with or don’t want to see. Shouldn’t be dismissed. The OP just shared some photos and asked a question. I don’t know what his previous comments are about. And I made some negative ones about ineos with their pricing which I believe those comments were also valid and someone’s opinion. But telling someone they aren’t welcome cause they are sharing are Surely breaking the rules of the group.",ineosgrenadier

"I’ll say this: my experience off-road gives the edge to the grenadier merely because it comes with more appropriate tires stock. The ones that come on the defender really aren’t a suitable size/aspect and won’t do well. 

All the other stuff matters a lot less IMO. Most of the time people don’t rock crawl in 80k vehicles. On rough trails, with the right tires, they will probably both do pretty OK. 

I think the ineos cargo space is nicer, and it comes stock with a lot of stuff I’d want to add to a LR. But, really, the elephant in the room is going to be the new Land Cruiser, it’s specs, and it’s price. (In the US)",ineosgrenadier

"I think this is basically right. Its a $1000 option to buy the vehicle, but if the financing is garbage, the economy is garbage, or some other vehicle is announced/priced/sold that suits better, you lose the $1000. 

At this point, I can't see auto rates coming down for a while. Even if the fed pauses hikes, I doubt we'll see cuts for the foreseeable future. They have a lot of work ahead of them using monetary policy to fix deficiencies in our fiscal approach. 

Honestly, I feel for Ineos. Their market looked a lot different for a 1 ton payload bare bones SUV at $60k in 2019 than it looks for a <1 ton, $85K SUV in 2023. They've not timed the market well, entirely by accident. Still, having had my $450 locked up for a while, and not getting any real discounts in the US for being an early res holder, It would be very nice to see a discounted financing option.",ineosgrenadier
"Same story here. I wish you the best of fortunes in whatever your next car may be.

Go buy one what? A discovery TD6? I already own one. The real question is why is Ineos constantly shitting on us and your fanboy power is still trying to justify why a vehicle going for 40-60% more is acceptable.

"I ordered mine mid-August and originally had a Q1 delivery date, I've spoken with the dealer several times since the first of the year and was told it would hitting the US east coast by the end of February. My account does not show it as in production.

I checked my order on the INEOS website early last week and noticed the estimated delivery quarter is now Q4. I called the dealer last week and they are checking with their INEOS rep about the delay, still haven't heard anything going on a week.

The salesman at the dealer did tell me INEOS didn't invest much in the webpage and that it is prone to glitching. He also mentioned a delay like that seemed strange. If there is a delay he mentioned it might be due to the two tone top. I was told if I ordered today I'd get it by Q4, so the delivery window being Q4 for my order back in August made even less sense. He mentioned, if I wanted, there were several on the lot that people decided they didn't want and I could come by and pick one of those up (not too excited about that option).

Lastly, a friend of mine ordered a similar Grenadier setup including the same two tone colors the day after I put my order in and his order is still showing Q1 delivery.

The glitchy website seems to make some sense as I see another poster had his showing as not in production but got a call saying it was delivered. I'm inclined to think this is most likely. I hope to get some information on mine this week.",ineosgrenadier

"For sure. You could do it for less. I would be tempted by some upgrades to the LC1958, and would probably go king instead of dobinson (I already have all the stuff to rebuild kings and I know them). 

I like the grenadier trunk more, and the ladder setup, but mostly the tow rating. For me, I might very realistically use the 7700 lb rating in some
Day to day capacity. 

That would probably leave me with the GX550, which is going to be a harder compare to the grenadier, since it’s mileage isn’t much better, and there’s no “utility” trim. 

It’s a tough call. 

OTOH, the price for the LC is such that I might just keep my Tundra and end up with truck+DUV instead of TruckUV combo.",ineosgrenadier

In this particular case I assume weight has a play in those conditions. Lighter will be better. Considering that the lines are similar. tire tread and psi also have a changing factor. If those were all the same then it comes down to torque and weight and traction control. But the biggest difference is weight and ground pressure imo.,ineosgrenadier

$1000-1500 for a rack
$2500 for some Dobinsons and UCAs

Total $5500-6000

"The engine is used in a lot of other cars. But in the grenadier it's moving something over 6,000lbs. The gas efficiency on it is already terrible. So tweaking all those things are going to greatly affect your mileage, inspections and warranty. Beyond that. I would say drive it stock first cause its really smooth off-road. Sand won't make a big deal if you have the right tires and aired down. The gearing gives you a lot of torque. But really it depends on your use the bigger you go on everything the more you need every where else. But yes you should be able to squeeze and strain what is there a bit.",ineosgrenadier

Curious: where does one go to get these serviced?,ineosgrenadier
"I think the specifics about the dealership model will be interesting to see. I somewhat doubt they're going to be traditional US-style franchises, but probably more like ""showrooms"" like tesla has. There are laws in the US that just make this difficult, but I also suspect that this is why they're only launching in a handful of states that also have tesla showrooms. 

regarding pricing, this may inflame some, but, I think a lot of people wanted a mall crawler and weren't honest with themselves about it. If you think the value isn't there with the Ineos and you can sub to a Tacoma, 4runner, Jeep, etc, then the Ineos ethos wasn't really a great fit in the first place. 

I think for what it is, the price puts it in good company with more heavy duty vehicles like an LC300/200, but isn't so leather/fragile/etc. instead, they took the money from those luxuries and added mechanical stuff - solid front axles, lockers, etc. 

I'm definitely bummed about pricing, but I'm still not seeing many substitutes. Bronco/4Runner/Jeep can't tow much, Pickups have long wheelbase, poor break-over, and struggle to hit trails without giving up and getting micro-bed pickup (and honestly, if 4ft bed is good for you, why not an SUV?), and pickups with campers still don't have temp controlled cabs. Bronco has poor roof load, jeeps are just kinda cheap (because they're cheap). 

and then there's off-road toys - TRX, Raptor, etc. Those are also awesome, but I mean...I think there's a case to be made that you should just get a RZR and a trailer, and if you want to do high speed off-road, go with something much much lighter. 

The Ineos threads a needle between a lot of different roles, and makes some tradeoffs to do it. But, I feel they did do a good job of not trading off the mechanicals. 

\---

The answer for utility and farming, IMO, is a trailer+suv. lower load floor, higher capacity, can unhitch without emptying, only hook it up when you need it, and they come much bigger than truck beds. the load floor on my tundra is 40"" with a 1"" lift and 35s. hard to live with. The Ineos on 33s has a better breakover and approach/departure than my leveled tundra on 35s with coil-overs. The infos has THE SAME payload, and a slightly lower tow capacity because it weighs MORE than the tundra.",ineosgrenadier

I did a ton of research on this. And initially the first launch defenders did have some electrical issues but most of that stuff has been sorted out. Gas engines have been very reliable compared to the diesel but you can’t even get that here in the states. There are always outliers of people who have some issues or very minor things that cars just end up having with wear and tear. But as a whole the defender is really reliable. The only thing I have noticed that body damage on the vehicle for whatever reason is really expensive to fully replace. So if you decided to go extreme with the vehicle just keep that in mind. Land Rover in general just has a high level of scrutiny and criticism from their history and high pricing. But they also have cult like following of people who just love them.

"That’s one concern I have of the grenadier: underpowered.  It’s a 5500lb beauty and doesn’t break 300hp.  0-62 is 8.8 seconds from the bmw turbo 6.

"I feel for you, I was in the same boat until I saw pricing. It's a really looker, and overall it appears like it's got all the markings of a fantastic vehicle, but without even seeing one in person or driving it, the price just isn't there for anything but as a status symbol, and frankly I see it being mostly for the crowd of ""I'm a traveler and outdoorsy person"" with the LL bean boots and luxury vacations overseas and less for it's intended use.

They have just placed themselves in a really challenging position in the market. They aren't a traditional luxury vehicle, and lack a lot of the support and luxury items that go along with it. They aren't a traditional ""off road suv"" and are priced far too high with the downsides you have to deal with.

Like, this thing has a starting price of over 70 grand, and it doesn't come with standard heated seats? It doesn't have diff locks standard? A total base model, then add heated seats, F/R lockers, and the aux switches, and you're at 76k. It's a super cool truck, but it's a toy at that point.

4 door rubicon with hard top and heated seats comes to 56.5k before discounts, so prob about 50k or a hair over after them. That's a 20k difference for a vehicle with a known dealer network, crazy aftermarket support, and fantastic resale.

Five foot,ineosgrenadier
"I was hours away from putting a deposit on one after a test drive. Looks, capability, etc are very impressive. 

Value is the question. Bought a new defender just over a year ago. Waited more than a year for it. It’s been great. Grenadier has something special. But when I ran the numbers wow the grenadier’s options add up in a hurry. Mine was hitting close to if not over $90k. Objectively that’s a lot and the Defender is still great. Most high end cars call for premium gas these days. 

I have questions about reliability and dealer network. Will evaluate in a few years. Still love it but urgency isn’t there anymore especially from a value standpoint.",ineosgrenadier

"I really like the idea of the Land Cruiser. I’m looking to get something I could be with for the next 30 years ideally. Being based here in Utah, I love driving through the red rocks in Moab out to the mountains in Colorado, or over to the Nevada desert. I’m planning on putting a vehicle through its paces, and need a platform built on reliability and maintainability. I loved the idea of ordering parts from Ineos directly to my house and installing and maintaining the Grenadier myself. You know, so it could be cheaper, and create a community. But I’m not confident a decent grenadier community is going to exist out west here due to the high costs. 
I’m with you on wishing the Grenadier was going to be something like the FJ",ineosgrenadier
"Dealerships, ADMs, etc... Who knows? If they charge and people pay, they will keep charging them. Regardless, I have no issue with a company charging what they feel is appropriate. That's their choice. I was considering it at $65k optioned the way I wanted. It would be comparative to my Gladiator Rubicon. At $20k more than that, I'm not interested. The lack of a gauge cluster was disappointing. The shifter not being bespoke to the vehicle was an eyesore. And the price reveal was the final nail in my Ineos journey. 

No way it doesn't take a year or two to sort issues and move to manufacturing at scale. So I save the money and frustration of a 1st gen, even if I do really love the exterior styling.",ineosgrenadier

"Thank you for your answers. As I otherwise like the IG, I'll have a look around for a replacement seat. The Recaro Ergomed looks good. But I will look around for an alternative first.

On #2, if you have any plans to add aux electrical items like fridge, winch, lights, ham radio, etc. it would be good to get the factory prewired and warrantied electrical systems. They also extend the wiring (with the right gauge wires) and terminate it as deutsch connectors inside and on the roof for easy connections. Doing this after market will be quite expensive. Now, for the $2K they charge, they only give you an AGM battery instead of the Li-Po battery they should give in the first place. But the CTEK charger is solid and you can always swap out the AGM for a Li-Po later.

&#x200B;

On #1, As far as traction systems go, IMHO, the pecking order of effectivity/ desirability/ mechanical sympathy is articulation i.e. wheels touching the ground followed by lockers followed by ECU/ ABS traction systems. Front locker is arguably for the most extreme situations and if used poorly can damage the driveline. But a rear locker is actually quite useful to not chew up tires or cause mechanical overload during tricky ascents. Furthermore, using lockers instead of ABS based traction systems is more sympathetic to the trails and doesnt chew them up.

Lastly having both these options, I would argue will improve your resale value. Especially lockers which can be an expensive install aftermarket",ineosgrenadier

"Who said I couldn’t afford it? Oh, people don’t complain about high car prices? Hmmm. Those of us complaining are because Ineos needs to hear us. We were early adopters that supported the company based on its statements and vision. When they take your reservations and hype everything at one price point to basically use you as a marketing point then turn around and bang up the price, it’s bad practice. It’s not about if someone can afford the price it’s about the value at that price and $90-$100k for this is a shit deal. It’s not a luxury vehicle. With the new GX coming out that checks all the same boxes they’re going to see their sales plummet. I’ve placed my order and going to ride it just to see how bad they let the dealers screw us then will probably cancel.  This was marketed as a no nonsense 4x4 for the working people with a cost of $55-$65k. So when it comes in 40% more, yea, it’s shit and people that have waited for years and watched whatever news came out everyday feel screwed over. Like they read our enthusiasm and decided to charge more for it.",ineosgrenadier

In that meeting they said since the purpose of the vehicle was off road, overlanding globally they were going to provide owners with schematics and be able to get maintenance from local resources. So in the middle of nowhere you could still get your vehicle moving along. They even talked about shipping parts to owners to fix the truck.",ineosgrenadier

My Jeep Rubicon Unlimited is not “a lot more capable” than my Grenadier.   My Grenadier also has front and rear locking diffs and so far there is nothing the Rubicon can do that the Grenadier can’t.   The only exception might be when an obstacle might require more articulation and in that case the Rubicons sway bar disconnect might give it an edge but that is a far cry from saying it “way better”.    As far as build quality I can say without hesitation that the Grenadier is way more overbuilt than my Jeep.   The Grenadier is built like a tank.,ineosgrenadier

It’s California. Land of dreams right. Newest truck in the land. They are hoping for off takers.,ineosgrenadier
"A lot of US states also limit towing speed limits. My understanding is that in the US they have general rating classes which each vehicle is placed in but in Europe each vehicle is individually rated and hence sometimes have higher tow ratings. Though the Grenadier has a great tow rating so I'm not sure how that's really relevant anyway. 

It's true that US payloads are often lower than in Europe but that is for very silly American reasons:
1 - Marketing. Manufacturers want to sell big trucks, and small trucks with great payload (or tow) ratings means big expensive trucks won't sell as well. 
2 - Luxury. Most truck owners don't need a truck, they want to look big and macho, and choose a vehicle that is bad for both them and society, and so manufacturers make trucks extremely luxurious which then means they're heavy and payloads suck.

But Ineos doesn't have either of these issues. The truck *is* the big version and so should have a payload to match, it isn't particularly luxurious and doesn't have a stupid amount of extra weight because it. The Grenadier is a heavy SUV but a truck bed should allow weight savings and could have been specially engineered for payload. But it wasn't and hence is redundant everywhere except North America, which is also the place that it will be penalised even more by the chicken tax so it's essentially redundant everywhere.

The Grenadier could have been such a home run (and still could be if they changed direction) but so many choices have been made that have gutted the supposed purpose of a do anything rugged offroader for the working outdoorsman.",ineosgrenadier

"Noted, thanks for the advice, if I end up upgrading the car I will share the upgrades with everyone here with the feedback.

But the question is since it uses B58 engine, which is more and less same engine as Supra and others, will it hurt doing an ECU upgrade? I'm only planning to do that when everything gets fixed under warranty first with all the current bugs.

As for as I know the engine can do alot of power with ECU but transmission is limited in Torque, and apparently Grenadier already at the limit of that hence transmission change was recommended by some guys who spoke about it",ineosgrenadier
It's an oil change not rocket science,ineosgrenadier
The question is also are you ever willing to pay for the car to be towed 4 hours away. Cause it could happen. The rational thing to do is wait for things to be resolved. Don’t hold any promises Ineos says until it’s real. They have been known to under deliver so far On things they want but just can’t deliver. So if they say there is going to be a closer dealership. Just don’t believe them.,ineosgrenadier

 Yes I understand legendary Toyoya engine and build quality but the prices intersect.",ineosgrenadier
There’s no doubt that the perception of cost intentionally or unintentionally got inflated from the original marketing. This is going to be a play thing for the rich. The demographic for this are old men over 50 who can afford this. As much as I was a fanboy of this and telling all my friends about this car no one knew about and how it’s suppose to be this amazing reliable car at a great price point. It was all just to good to be true. The pricing now is just the reality. The reliability of the car currently in Europe is not so reliable. It’s been plagued ironically by loads of electronic issues. That they said will be fixed in a few months… remind you they had a million miles to figure that out. Even on the prototype I tested a few weeks ago the screens weren’t working correctly on some of the features. My guess is that this won’t work it self out soon. This is the reality with buying a first of its kind from a company making its first vehicle. I was also told that the network is going to actually be ineos dealerships and selling at sticker price. But as of now I wouldn’t take anything ineos says at their word. It’s all marketing. They have to pivot and things go wrong. I ordered a new defender a couple of days ago and I’m actually really happy I did. It’s not gonna look as cool. But I actually think will be more reliable. Contrary to what people say about JLR but the latest defenders. They seem to have work some of the tech issues from the release and the last two years have been solid.

In terms of drivability and refinement it’s all about what you’re comparing to. I still maintain it didn’t go badly for its dimensions and personally, as a European with our petrol prices etc, as much as I like to worship at the church of V8 and think that anything less belongs on a lawnmower, actually the BMW 6 pot is more than enough for my use. 

Not sure how I’d reconcile my feelings if the price had gone up by 1/6 since I bought. Probably pushed it to the “unaffordable so don’t even think about it” territory.

To add: I have no idea about the mechanics or economics of flipping a vehicle, and don’t have a big infrastructure behind me. When it came to selling mine, there were not masses of offers and I really have no idea what an acceptable margin is if one were doing this seriously.

"I'd say the new defender is more capable overall. Reliable, not sure but defenders have been said to have gotten most the bugs out.  Repairable? Can't fix anything on them really.

&#x200B;

I say this because I have a Discovery TD6 and find it extremely capable. There's never been anything I've wanted to do that it couldn't.  I don't think there's anything I'd want to do in the Grenadier that it couldn't do either. So both of them can do 100% of what I want.  The disco has an incredible traction control system.  Doing switchbacks on a rough steep climbing road in colorado recently the disco just handled everything for me.  Cutting turns on loose gravel while climbing steep it'd engage the lockers and disengage as needed. It'd brake a spinning wheel in a heartbeat.  It was fantastic at it.  The traction control on the Disco is better than the Grenadier.  Again, the grenadier is more old school and requires you to handle those things. I'm not saying they both wouldn't make it to the top of the scenario I was in but I am saying the Disco just handled it for you. You never spin a tire in that thing it's so responsive.  The second a tire leaves the ground it's already stopped and power has been shifted but the Grenadier will need a little more effort.

As someone said watch the Robert pepper youtube.  If he gets a modern defender or disco on there I think people would be amazed. He does things where he takes them through obstacles without lockers engaged and shows how they struggle.  The new Defender and Discos will probably just walk through it thanks to it's automation.

&#x200B;

The LR's do have a lot that can go wrong. I haven't had many issues on mine that weren't self induced but the potential is there.  However the Grenadier's can too, we don't know yet. But reviewers have pointed out the wiring hanging low and being exposed, etc.  The Grenadier still has a turbo and a high-tech engine that might have tons of history and mileage on them but none of that was really off-road or in demanding environments.  Things like how well the transmission cools is an unknown.  Those mechanics still have computers that can shut you down.  So time will tell there.  The only for sure thing is the Grenadier is build on ladder frame and with more durable parts.

&#x200B;

I grew up farming on a large 35,000 acre ranch where we beat the shit out of everything. Washboard roads like Tanzania all day.  My 1998 F150 got the snot rattled and beat out of it day in/out and never had an issue.  There's simply no way my Discovery could take that abuse.  The Grenadier could.  But there's no way my F150 could do half the things my Discovery can. So it comes down to use case.  I'm on the fence between the Grenadier and GX550 if I'm being honest.  I need the towing.  It's going to be my daily driver and want to love the Grenadier but I think I just need a little time with it to find out if it's the right direction for me. I live in a large city so hopefully when the dealers are announced officially and they have a couple on the lot I can finally get some time on the road.  How it handles asphalt is my biggest concern.  I've learned through all my working off-road that nothing beats what's between the ears. Before this trip to colorado I've never off-roaded for the sake of it. It's never been a hobby. It's either been for work or hunting.",ineosgrenadier

"UK owner here. Took delivery of mine in May 2023, got 15000 on the clock now. I use it for Towing an excavator, road trips, offroading, camping, daily driving, etc... (Everything). 

I absolutely love the vehicle. I had a 2012 JK 2 door before, and the Grenadier is a much roomier and usable thing day to day. Even over a 4-door jeep, the lack of roll cage and height of the load space is much better for moving stuff, plus payload and towing ability is night and day better. 

It's not a city car. You definitely feel like you're driving something that's not made for urban environments when you're in one, but that's only been a novelty to me so far and not a problem. 

You really don't need to spec a lot to have a very nice vehicle. I'd say lockers are a must, as the TC isn't as good as some other makes. The dash compass really brings the feel of the interior up a notch, so deffo tick that. 
I didn't opt for Safari Windows. I don't miss them. I've got the stock fabric seats, which are really nice, plus the electrical prep and dual battery, which was really only to power my fridge when we go away. Nice to have all wired in from factory, but by no means essential. 

I got the stock 17 steel wheels with the KO2s in the ""rough pack"" which with lockers only worked out as £50 or so more than just the lockers on their own. I sold the BFGs and the steels separately, and bought some aftermarket BRAID wheels with 33"" muds. 

Don't bother with the Ineos stock side steps or sliders,  there are better options aftermarket now like the Buzz overland stainless rock slider/step combo.

The panel gaps are tight and interior, with no issues in terms of squeaks or rattles.  The biggest difference is the thickness or weight of the doors and body.  The Grenadier is about 2k pounds more in weight. Grant a large portion can be attributed to the solid axels which are manufactured from a tractor company.   You need to slam the doors to get them to shut tight.  The drive of Grenadier is fun but not as spirt as the Defender.  The new defender drives like a modern sports car that can be a beast off road.

"2.9%, so below inflation",ineosgrenadier
"With most preorders, you can always expect a high cancelation rate. With the Tesla Model Y it was in the 60% cancelation rate range. The higher the purchase price, the higher the cancelation rate (to be expected) so a cancelation rate of 75% for the Ineos is “within expectations”. You have to factor in the high price, with an inflating economy (people are poorer) so it all makes sense. 

With that being said, due to cafe standards, there is talk of Ineos being limited in how many units it can legal sell in the USA. Rumors have the federal cap at 5000 per year. If this is actually true, you can count on the Ineos having a very high residual value. 

In context to automobile ownership, the single most expensive part of ownership is depreciation. If we **speculate** low depreciation due to the federal mandated cap on sales, you might end up very happy owning the Ineos.

With that being said, a car is never an investment. Just wanted to share with you all the business of automobiles. Furthermore, the most expensive part of car manufacturing is keeping the plant at capacity. If the Ineos takes off demand wise, the factory will not give any special incentives, however it is common in the beginning run of a new automobile, for the factory to incentivize early adoption to help ensure proper market launch (market saturation) at the early stages of launch. This is all to say, if the Ineos is an in demand vehicle, your best bet on securing the best deal, is to be an **early adopter** or wait a few years for the factory to get through all the lent up demand. 

My advice is anyone is on the fence, is to buy it. Odds are, due to the rarity of its purpose (built on purpose overlanding machine), these types of

"This also assumes everyone is looking for an offroader to climb rocks with.  Just because something is marketed as a no-nonsense 4x4 doesn't mean overlanding at 2mph over boulders.  I've yet to see a single Grenadier by any of their marketing or people that have owned them do anything a generic 4x4 couldn't do.  A defender/discovery can tow 8200lbs, have roof racks, etc. But to off-road doesn't mean climbing rocks it means to go off the road.  I hunt, work on farms at times, spend most my off-roading going through mud, sand, creeks and I do it for a reason, not a hobby.  They marketed it as no nonsense 4x4.  That was understood to be the opposite of a $100k vehicle. They've built a solid vehicle but it's no more solid than many others.  I may never see a mountain in the thing but I will see a lot of flat lands country, boat towing, etc and they're definitely charging a premium. It's not up to someone that thinks themself purist that has the right to tell me or anyone else we're buying it for the wrong reasons. We have our use cases and this was marketed towards those.

"Nah, don't get me wrong. I'm not knocking the vehicle or its build quality.

For years. I closely followed the development of the grenadier , on every newsletter, media outlet and ineos email update I could, eagerly waiting it's arrival to Canada, when they said "" more than a wrangler, less than a defender"" I figured, okay, so it might be around the 65-70,000$cad mark, and while that was in the very high end of what I could afford or justify to spend on a vehicle, I was still eagerly ready to sign papers and take one home, but then they came back and *sike* it's now 95k for the entry level, and like 120,000$ for the field master, that instantly crushed any hope I had of ever procuring one. 

In my eyes it went from my dream rugged , built tough badass suv based on the old school legend, to a vehicle that only high tier buisineses or the wealthy could afford.

It broke my heart, is what I'm saying. Lol

I mean, I get it, but if I had that much to spend I could get a fully loaded gmc Sierra denali AT4X. Or somthing.",ineosgrenadier
14mpg for an inline 6 in 2023 for any SUV is just not reasonable.  I'm not sure why they even talk about towing capability.  You'll be getting gas every 100 miles or so,ineosgrenadier

I was watching a piece on the New Land Cruiser and what the ground clearance is 8 inches. So you will need to add a lift.

He bought a commercial version which moves the rear seat forward which also exposes the area in the back.   The electrical issue you have referenced k.

"Yeah, there is something counterintuitive about the price point vs people who want to take care of the car themselves. At a low price point (think, real off-road beaters) people will have the time and desire (to keep it cheap.) Then as the price increases, the time drops off (unless talking about the hardcore hobbiest types - I'd put myself in that bucket) into you get to a much higher price point, at which point those people are going to just hand over the truck to a shop to do it because they can afford it and don't have the desire to deal with all the maintenance themselves.

"Exact same boat. $20k (ie, 25% lower than the $85k the configurator says my preferred build would cost) would be a no-brainer purchase for me.

Best case, I get a vehicle which is robust and sturdy that last's me 10+yrs like my current vehicle (I'd be ok with being a beta-tester for new electronics, software, etc., if the vehicle was bang-for-the-buck.)

That said, I just came across today, that Toyota is planning on re-introducing the Land Cruiser badge in the US (based on the LC Prado, not 300) and also Lexus with GX/TX models tba next week. Given the price point, I think any of those vehicles would fall in the same category of 'bulletproof' and off-road capable.

I'm talking about the 2024 Land Cruiser. No one one has it yet. There will be a ton of different trims and models. Also if your also counting Lexus GX which would be the same but just more premium then there is much more options and trim models. Currently the most reliable vehicles with the highest resale value and reliability are Toyotas. Name any car brand and on the forums theres someone going to say there is x issue etc. Thats why it's more important to look at the brand as a whole and the service and network. The Grenadier is suppose to have the ease of repairability. But they kinda dropped the ball on it when they are now not letting every day people or mechanics have access to the repair manual they said they were going to offer to every one digitally. So you can't just go to any mechanic at the moment.,ineosgrenadier

Btw, since posting, I did come across that Alu Cab have been in talks with Ineos about a new roof pop up in a video I will link (at the 10 min mark), and even made some 3D models of the vehicle to work with. No word yet on if anything is being made though.

"Losing it, no. Comping to the gx550 hard, yes. It’s tough because the price is high. If it were the same price as an overtrail Gx, I’d be in no question. As it stands, I’d still rather have the solid axles, but, I think the grenadier is somewhat overbuilt and under engineered. They could have saved weight in some places that increased payload. They could also have given it more hp. 

That said, I have a tundra, and Toyota IFS is a PITA,  lifts are not great and mess with KDSS, and luxury materials get beat up and destroyed. 

I’m attracted to the gren, want a 2 inch lift, king shocks, steering damper swap to OME, 285/70r18s, and a chip for a bit more power. That to me is still likely cheaper and easier than the Lexus to get equivalent clearances. 

The damn digital service manual is a near deal killer though. I want it. They need to release it and I want to read the damn thing before I buy. (Red Noland told me mine is built and arriving within 60 days or so)",ineosgrenadier

"OMG! So much mudslinging. Someone is always bound to take exception to something. Lets please be adults here and move on.

&#x200B;

My 2 cents, hopefully, that dont add fuel to the fire. I am one of the early (<first 50) hand raisers and put in my deposit back in 2021 the day the reservations opened for the Gren. I am an unabashed enthusiast of the car, its build ethos and sheer bravado to launch a new car company in today's nanny state day and age.

At the same time, I am a long term GX admirer. Based on the Prado platform it has long proven itself as good as a land cruiser..If anything the current gen GX is a bit more compact, and lighter than the LC200 but has the same-ish payload

&#x200B;

However, IMHO for serious travelers I dont think the GX and Ineos are comparable. Infact as I will elucidate below, I dont think the INEOS is still ready for primetime in the petrol format for serious travelers.

RELIABILITY:

Toyotas reliability is what gets touted every time. But the new GX is a totally new platform both engine and gearbox. The Ineos engine and gearbox are arguably more tried and tested. Hell even Toyota uses the same engine for the Supra

Toyota has more engineering prowess, deeper pockets and a brand reputation to protect and will address the reliability problems if any, especially for a Lexus branded vehicle. Ineos on the other hand doesnt have that luxury to have reliability issues.

That being said, other systems like window regulators, air conditioning, power mirrors, fuel and water pumps, etc. Toyota is peerless. My german vehicles have always had one or the other itty-bitty thing fail. Nothing critical but enough to be a serious nuisance. My Camry on the other hand..effing bulletproof

&#x200B;

OFFROADABILITY:

Again, here I dont see GX and Gren on the same page. IFA vs. Solid Axle, Double locked vs. Triple locked, Off road specific thinking like, turning off fans, seat belt alarms etc. vs. way more (arguably reliable) electronics. Both can go as large as 33"" wheels before design decisions start necessitating modifications. I would argue that true overlanding is happiest at 33"" anything more and you are going into rock crawling territory.

Furthermore, the Gren, has provisions for manual overrides, if your gearbox or tcase lock up so that you can limp home. Yes it is a modern electronic laden vehicle but they have taken into account some of the extreme case scenarios.

The new GX is much better looking and square designed than the outgoing one. However, I dont think the approach and departure angles are dramatically improved. I dont know the actual numbers but I think the current gen 4Runner has better approach angles. For a serious GX build (winch, spare relocate, etc.) one might need to cut the bumpers

The Gren is not faultless, if you look underneath a delivered Grenadier, there are all kinds of wires and cables which are not routed properly. These are prime to be torn off by an errant root or rock. I think this vehicle needs under body skids..if only to protect the hoses and wires

&#x200B;

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

\- Both these vehicles are abysmal in terms of fuel economy. 14 and 17 mpg!! Not in 2023. Couple that with a 23-24 gallon fuel tank and you have a serious restriction in range. I seriously do hope the aftermarket addresses this. I know it will for the Lexus eventually. Relocating the spare in the Lexus itself will unlock another 20 gallons..but then you have to add the cost + weight of a rear bumper and swingouts. I still am unsure for the petrol Grenadier (Overlanders in most markets will probably go for the Diesel)

\- The Petrol cars get an inferior ZF transmission with a lower headroom for torque. This means you cant tune it..again the goal isnt to tune the car but to understand at what % of total capacity is the gearbox working at. The ZF in petrol is rated to 500N-m but the one in diesel is 750N-m. The petrol engine already puts out a peak of 450N-m. Very poor choice INEOS

\- The Ineos is better setup for aftermarket modding. The location of the battery (away from the hot engine bay), the factory aux system setup and the self service manuals and servicing mentality is fabulous. Other manufacturers need to learn here

\- The GX will definitely have a better aftermarket support..well because it will outsell the Grenadier 5 to 1

\- Besides, the fuel economy the biggest irk I have is that, Ineos started as a new auto maker and had an opportunity to go direct to consumer (like Tesla, Rivian and now maybe Ford) but chose to go the dealer route. To me this means as a consumer I have limited to recourse to deal with dealer shenanigans of silly mark ups. With Toyota/ Lexus atleast they have enough dealers that I can take my business elsewhere but nearby

&#x200B;

TLDR: The shite, MPG not withstanding, I am in for the Grenadier but if the local dealer I get wants a cent of markup they can bugger off. I understand all the pains of launching a new auto company but as early hand raisers, thats the minimum courtesy I expect to be extended from Ineos.

I feel, A lot of the folks are bailing on the Ineos pre-orders because of the crazy cost of capital. Interrest rates of 6-7% are not a fiscally wise decision if you intend to keep the Grenadier and not flip it. That being said, anyone under the delusion that the Grenadier is overpriced, is kidding themselves. The average cost of all vehicles has gone up. By the time you mod a current GX to be on par with the Grenadier, you are close to $90-$100K. Same thing with a 4Runner. A new Sequoia starts at $80K for the off road trim. A Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, is $60K but not the same payload or robustness. The LC200 was $84K. Even if you take a 15% discount for unproven reliability that lands you at $71K which is exactly where the Grenadier is priced at",ineosgrenadier

"Not sure why that was downvoted, it's true.

Story goes (according to Wikipedia), they actually wanted to get the tooling for the Defender when Land Rover stopped making it, but LR said no (understandably), so they made a clone essentially. 

I think it's cool in its own right, if you can manage to ignore that the 1983-2016 body style Defenders exist and that's what it's trying to be. Like you can't *not* compare them, and it's almost like a mashup between the 110 and G Wagon.",ineosgrenadier

"I think the published figures are not final EPA numbers yet, and I think they are low, but not that far off.  The Gren is a full time FWD about the same weight as my LR3.  Mine is a V8, and probably a little less efficient than the Gren, but my guess is the Gren will likely get 14-15 around town and maybe 18+ on the freeway, with a tailwind.  Maybe 16 combined.  Regardless of engine, physics are what they are and a FWD, square-shaped, 3-ton truck will burn a certain amount of fuel regardless of engine.",ineosgrenadier
"Like I said I’ve owned and modified multiple solid axel land rovers so that was my base line. It was a combination of the wandering steering alway guessing where the wheels were pointed, a lot of nose dive and I currently have a b58 in a BMW and the engine couldn’t have felt more different. I know they are tuned for reliability but dang ineos really cut the balls off that great drive train and no one is going to tune it while under warranty - in 3 years if you can tune it to 500 hp (down pipe and ecu tune)  it could solve alot of problems which is great for the platform.

"I been following ineos ince day one. I put in a preorder from day first open deposit day. Waited years. Closely followed all the q and a’s and all the marketing. There were just a lot of promises from when they started and what they used to say to sell and market the vehicle. Then for reasons they couldn’t deliver. For example, they promised cad and digital schematics for owners and their party brands to access to repair and develop parts for. They sold people on pricing for the vehicle that they underestimated for, I could let this slide because of the state of things. but still don’t say anything if you don’t know. They have also promised that people would be able to get parts shipped to them anywhere in the world in two days. That is not the case at all. People waiting weeks and months for parts. They emphasized this was gonna be a reliable thing when they start delivering vehicles. When cars were released with electrical gremlins and sensor issues. they said these issues will be resolved in a few weeks. It’s been over a year and still people have issues. With new cars delivered with the same issues still. So I’m not salty, it’s just information that people should know that they say a lot and they don’t deliver. They are better off just being truthful. Say we don’t know we plan to. Don’t say it will be and not deliver.",ineosgrenadier

"Here’s a very stream of consciousness vibe I got. Honestly I can’t say anything surprised me, and I mean that as a positive. Has a larger presence in person than in pics which was nice. Plenty of room front and back for me (6’2”). Wife and I enjoyed driving it and it seems to ride quite nice, again understanding that it’s a solid front axel. Fit and finish seemed good. Overall very substantial and solid feeling as far as the doors/frame. The trunk area seemed bigger than expected. The buttons and switches seemed very slightly less stout than I wanted but not remotely flimsy. The gauges and dials are minimal but in a cool way. Didn’t get to mess with CarPlay or anything but I bet it seems small but that is as expected again. The fact it even has CarPlay is huge (looking at you, Rivian). The front roof windows are cool but I do wish there were more windows up top like a second moonroof over the rear passengers or replace the outer roof grab handles with windows like in a Defender.

It’s utilitarian with the non-powered seats, no cooling seats, no adaptive cruise, less safety nannies, merely decent engine power, and such but again that’s the point. The other people I talked to there who seemed to most dig it were coming from other like-minded vehicles like Wranglers and Tacomas. There were some people who seemed like they would probably be happier in a modern Defender or X7 but maybe I’m just projecting.

This vehicle seems to be for people who appreciate Wrangles and Broncos (but want something a little more refined and rare) as well as old Defenders and Land Cruisers (but want something that won’t struggle to merge on a highway and require constant upkeep). Again, maybe that’s just me projecting. If I didn’t already spend a mint and hours of wrenching on building up trail rig that I love I would get a Grenadier for myself.

As it stands we’re looking at it as my wife’s next vehicle. She loves “trucky” things and most SUV’s these days are neutered or at least bland to look at. She doesn’t like the wind noise and kinda cheap feeling Jeeps and Broncos. Doesn’t want a full size monster like a Tahoe. Misses her old FJ Cruiser but that had to go when we got kids with its tiny rear half-doors. G-Wagons are stupid expensive. The 4Runner is screaming for an update and the new USA “Land Cruiser” just pisses me off (don’t get me started lol).

Those major things and a few minor points brought us to focus on the Grenadier, Defender and upcoming Lexus GX550. For some reason that I can’t fathom she doesn’t like the Defender so that’s out.

Ultimately it’s going to come down to the cool tough “truckiness” of the Grenadier vs the still pretty tough but with more modern creature comforts of the GX. The third row of the GX will definitely factor in as well because in her current vehicle it’s rarely used but greatly appreciated when it is. We use my daily driver as the long road trip vehicle with the kids but if we didn’t then I would rule the Grenadier out given the lack of adaptive cruise and such. Lucky for me I’d be happy with either so she gets final say.

This became a lot longer and rambling than I intended when I started but has helped me organize my thoughts on it as well. And I figure the better I can describe my thoughts on the Grenadier and what other vehicles might be on peoples radar maybe it’ll help them make a decision as well.

TLDR the Grenadier is great if you understand what it is. If I accidentally slide my Land Cruiser off a trail and down the side of a mountain I will 100% be buying one of these to replace it. As it stands the wife is going to have to decide if it’s too utilitarian to be her daily driver.",ineosgrenadier

"if you read my reasons below, you'll understand why.  At the end, based on what I plan on doing with it, I'll only average in the single digits as far as mileage goes.  That's a problem.  Im actually going to put this vehicle to use, like off roading and towing - a lot.   And there are other ""3 ton $80k"" trucks and SUV with better HP to mileage.  And if you wipe the price from your supposed argument, 14mpg for an inline 6 producing 281hp and 332lbs of torque is not overly impressive. I honestly don't even know how they can claim a towing capacity if 7,700lbs but regardless, even if it can (I tow about 5,500), gas mileage is going to hurt.  So yes, I care.

The ineos forum goes into a lot of detail on the wide range of electrical issues. From Christmas lights going on dash. Tire pressure. Seat belt warning sounds not turning off for entire rides. Intermittent yellow and red warning lights turning on and off. And it’s happening to at least 25 percent of the delivered vehicles which is a lot. It’s not comforting to hear from ineos to ignore them and restart to vehicle. As some of these potentially could be real warnings as well. Otherwise mechanically the cars are running and not going into limp mode. It’s funny how some people are justifying that it’s okay. They really have drank the cool aid and shrugging off the fact they spent a crap ton of money and don’t want to believe that they might have a more serious problem. Or fully understand the risks and just patiently waiting. With the pricing and these electrical gremlins. I would be livid. The new defender had electrical problems but no where to this extent. It’s just amusing how much people complained about that and now some of the guys on the ineos side are like it’s okay no big deal but compared it’s far worse than I think they realize. Cause none of these random components were designed in house. And I bet that all these different sensors are having a hard time talking to each other. And a company that is not prioritizing electronics and software(crashed websites) might not have recognized the importance of software and engineers.,ineosgrenadier

I test drove it on the seperate occasions. Really wanted to like it.

This is a work utility vehicle and that’s how it was designed”. That made a lot of sense to me. The other issue I found was the front windshield was too low for my sight line. I’m 6’5” and I was hunching over often to see. Definitely an awesome truck for the right buyer goals.

Underbite? I see approach angle.,ineosgrenadier
"I think it depends on what you want to do with them.  In their stock form, assuming similar tires, my guess they’d both perform about the same.  The Defender has great approach and departure angles, better clearance with air shocks and a fantastic traction control system.  The Grenadier has better wheel articulation with good traction control and does have the ability for locked front and rear diffs.  They each have their pros and cons, but I think their capabilities would be close for most folks on most trails.  

The Gren is just a little easier to customize into something unique and potentially a better overlander and a better off roader with a skillful hand.",ineosgrenadier

Yea I’m looking at either pumping money into my 2017 Discovery (td6 diesel is amazing) or looking at a new defender I can still get for $15k less with all options of the defender.

TRD Pro can be had for $54kMSRP, would need fairly limited 'accessories' depending on need - e.g. winch, possibly different bumper and/or skid plates, aux power system... but out of the box it's already rock solid, and would give $16k for aftermarket bells and whistles (pop-up tent, better roof rack, whatever.)

On top of that, Toyota is bringing back the Land Cruiser (supposedly on the Prado design, so it will be lighter than the old 2021 era design) and June 8 Lexus is launching supposedly a new GX based on the Land Cruiser 300 format - again both of which should be around the 60-70k mark (maybe higher for Lexus) and very luxurious compared.

"That response is very outdated.  There are a LOT of 90k+ priced vehicles that get noticeably higher gas mileage than this.  It's an antiquated way of thinking in this day and age.  14mpg is just not acceptable in some markets.  Additionally, automakers always overstate their MPG so if anything, the real world MPG is probably going to hover around 10 to 12 mpg.   The problem is different people have different uses.  I for one have a trailer and I also go camping - a lot.  In remote places gas consumption should and is a factor.  At the same time, I can't purchase a Prius and expect to tow and carry all that gear.  With all that said, there is an expectation - at some level that an SUV that touts itself as a very capable one have somewhat of a reasonable gas mileage number.  If I were to haul my trailer, I would not even break the 10mpg mark. So why even bother marketing this SUV with a tow option?  At the very beginning, based on the engine specs, folks had suspected - even with the weight that the MPG would hover around 17-20.  That is why I'm a bit surprised and disappointed that not only it's not within that range, but it's well below it.  And I'm not sure where you are in the purchase process or if you're even getting one but I woke up this morning with an email notification telling me that pre-orders are open and that's when I immediately hopped on.  So if you can for a second emphasize, what is why my reaction is this way and now I have to revise my entire plan on which vehicle to purchase with this one basically being out of the running.  You can argue all you want about how MPG should not be a factor if it's a certain price but I'd like to think people over a certain tax bracket still have some common sense - like not killing a gallon of gas merely by driving 10 miles down a gravel road.",ineosgrenadier
"Not having done any proper analysis on the Gren in particular, most car manufacturers underdamp their suspensions in order to save money.  In order to avoid the ride feeling floaty or boaty as a result, they then overspring the vehicles.  As a result, the ride feels controlled but harsh.

The Gren may simply be a well designed suspension with performance as a primary goal rather than low cost, such that the vehicle can actually use more of its suspension travel every day but the dampers are capable of still controlling that movement.",ineosgrenadier
"It appears that US pricing is \~20% more than Europe (excluding taxes/vat) so that plays into it for me in terms of a value proposition.  It's about $10k too much for me to seriously buy it although I still hold a reservation.  For now, I'll probably cancel my reservation and wait a year to see if they can work out first year problems and also see if they are actually still around.  It also sucks that in the US, Ineos can't even guarantee dealer installed option labor prices, so that has to also be negotiated with the dealer so it's best to drop all dealer installed options (they have an asterisks) and hope there's an aftermarket with bolt-on options later.",ineosgrenadier

"The grenadier is not cheaper then the new landcruiser once you start matching up features. the landcruiser will be overall a smarter buy as it will be cheaper, more options and trims, a better dealer/service network. Toyota reliability and warranty. The Ineos will have a new kid cool factor and the design similar to that of the old defender. It’s suppose to be more durable and bomb proof and reliable, yet to be proven. it’s suppose to have less computers and be more mechanical. But it is the very first design and launch of the car and have had some issues. So you will be going through those growing pains as they figure all those things out. Electrical issues, dealership network. Spare parts and repairs, and recalls. Which is to be expected and is happening currently.

Part of my decision around getting a Grenadier is that I didn't want an EV off-roader / SUV. We spend too much time in the mountains and cold for it to make practical sense. Hybrid gives the best of both worlds IMO but I'm not technical enough to understand / appreciate the challenges of building a hybrid vs a pure EV.",ineosgrenadier

"Yeah, the price is WAY up there. As a car nut (and the wife also) if we have enough money that it doesn’t affect monthly living or retirement plans we would prefer to drive something that excites us. The Grenadier is right on that wavelength for sure on the excitement and pride-of-ownership. Money-wise it’s borderline, especially as we optioned the thing out to the hilt! You can equal, maybe even exceed the off-road capability with a loaded up Bronco or Wrangler while saving at least $20K while still scratching that “Paris to Dakar” itch but you won’t have something unique or classy. You could also have a handsome soft-roader that has more daily modern comforts like the GX550 but lose the ruggedness.

The Ineos is the only SUV I can think of that has true off-road chops/looks and uniqueness so ultimately the price is on whether its collective traits is what a buyer covets, because if it was the exact same vehicle with a Toyota or Ford badge it could be priced about as much as 30% lower I’d imagine.

Would like to hear if it is worthy of the asking price of  71K. Yours seems way more than that but I am routing only for a base. What can this be compared to from a mainstream manufacturer ? 4Runner TRD Pro is the only one that comes to mind. I have never been so excited for a 4x4 like this before.

Are you buying in the US or ROW,ineosgrenadier
And I cancelled my reservation!,ineosgrenadier
"D240. Still not sure what this issue is, the dealership keeps trying to fix the turbo but the underlying problem remains. 

As for the grenadier. It’s seems super solid. Really impressed with it. It’s a truck not and SUV so it’s on road drive is compromised compared with the defender, but it feels much more solidly built. I think the Defender is a brilliantly designed car that’s horribly built. The Ineos seems less well designed but better built. Defender was exceptionally liveable excepting the fact it’s died numerous times with less that 30k miles. The Ineos sacrifices some liveability but is a compelling package for its build and capability. The 7 seats in the defender were handy, and it’s a shame there’s no equivalent option with the Grenadier, but the second row is so wide that it actually swallows three car seats across quite comfortably, which the defender couldn’t. Both cars make you want to get out for an adventure. So there’s a couple random thoughts for you.",ineosgrenadier
Like 8am the morning it opened. My original reservation date was  3/31/22,ineosgrenadier
"Go buy one then? Why are you constantly shitting on the Ineos? Are you salty about the price?

Yea I mean there are numerous reasons for wanting/expecting a delivery date to be the date you’d expect to receive the vehicle.,ineosgrenadier
"You could buy a Jeep Gladiator or Wrangler and have it in 40s 1 ton axles and huge suspension travel for the same price. Then you have a desert truck and a rockcrawler. In addition to that, when you break it , the cost to fix it will be reasonablem This 90k SUV is for dumb causals, not car enthusiasts.",ineosgrenadier
Defender definitely would be more comfortable on the road but modern Land Rovers have terrible resale value. Most people lease then move on.,ineosgrenadier
"if you are happy with a new defender, the grenadier was the wrong reservation for sure.",ineosgrenadier
"Sales plummet? Like the LC200 did when it was available in the US? Why did toyota stop selling it? The company should decide what they should sell their product for. If you can't afford it, then move on and buy something else. 80k plus for a softcore prado based GX is worth it, but a utility built Ineos isn't? I think that's the problem. You can't expect quality in all parts and engineering and then expect it to be priced alongside a 4runner. I won't be surprised if they decide not tell in the US, like many other companies do.

I am not a fan of the toyota interior dash. just seems pretty randomly laid out compared to the grid in the grenadier. I think the grenadier rear doors are better than the non-split tailgate. I'm 6'3 and would hate to have to duck under the open gate all the time.",ineosgrenadier
"If the price was $20k cheaper I’d buy one. I’ve been thinking about trying to buy the most basic SUV I could find as my next car and this would have been the ticket. 4Runner is my #2 pick, I guess I’ll go with it. I can understand why the price is high. It’s a new venture so they are trying to recoup R&D costs as fast as possible incase it fails and the BMW powertrain is not cheap I’m sure. Hopefully overtime as they payoff R&D and tooling they will lower prices but I’m not going to hold my breath.",ineosgrenadier

I read somewhere they had lease problems, but my communication with the GM in that facility was abruptly halted when I inquired Friday about the status of my bill and I got back an email referring me to Ineos. 

They offered to refer me to a dealer in Southern California, and I think I would rather probably just go north Portland. I hope the first year software updates are mostly sorted.

Sure, the Grenadier about 15K more than many (including myself) 'hoping' for, good luck finding any other new 4x4 with the same chops / for significantly less. Hell USED Broncsquatchs are fetching between 60 and 65 with hardtops getting near the Grenadier.",ineosgrenadier

So the lawsuit must pertain to the previous generation and build. The new Generation will have hybrid systems to choose from in addition.",ineosgrenadier
"Each and every dealership needs to have a “pro”. I know far fetched thought, but especially in this market space where people add modifications and do their own trail side repairs, the dealership needs to have at least one guy that knows the ins and outs of everything in the car, the kind of person that can take the car apart and put it back together again.  

That being said, I’d also love to have a service station that allows and encourages their clientele to be in the shop and getting their hands dirty when their car is there for service.  That would really set Ineos apart from the rest of the market.  Yes I know insurance doesn’t allow it, but I’m sure we can figure out a waiver for it.  Don’t agree to the waiver?

Really thinking about getting an Ineos. Following this sub to see how everyone is liking them. Seems to be a good following.,ineosgrenadier
Also something to consider in the value of what you are getting with something like Jeep or Ford. The massive network of dealerships maintenance centers. The aftermarket accessories that can be bought anywhere. Yes it's probably not as good as the grenadier out of the gate in some aspects. But you can make it better and cheaper. Then a grenadier out the gate. People will perceive value differently and still see the grenadier as worth it and thats fine. Just my opinion that it's not right now and I feel that I stand with the majority that canceled. In a decade if they are still around they will need to be more competitive. They will need to win over people beyond the initial enthusiasts and fan boys. Or they can stay small and exotic.

This,ineosgrenadier
Supply and Demand will always play a factor. If the car is bullet proof and lasts forever then there will be less demand unless they can incentivize people to trade in or get something with new features. Or have a high inventory and lower costs. You see it with Tesla adjusting prices. Of any manufacturer they have the largest profit margin per car sold. Most average car companies make an average profit of $2k per car. So if there is wiggle room to come down they probably will. Or sell less cars cut down on production save money there and sell the vehicles that are even more pricey but offer more features like the Gwagon. They can also cut costs of production with developing their own engine in house more cost upfront with R&D but in the long run save significantly more. Same with all their other partners. The biggest reason for a new startup to use these other companies is to carry over their reputation into their build. But in doing so inflating costs for licensing and sharing profits.,ineosgrenadier

I highly doubt they are going to be making changes to the car from what we have seen in Europe. I assume the car that is out now is what is going to be in 2024. Small car manufactures generally don't update their car line up every year. Even the New defender hasn't had any changes in the last couple of years other then some options taken down and simplified. Tesla only most recently updated their roadster and S model after like two decades. Ineos can change anything on their end but I would assume what you see on the brochure is what you get. When the company makes more cars they will have modern safety equipment as well as follow strict emission standards. We will start to see changes to the engine and the way the truck is built. If you want those things I would wait. I like to see what they do with the pick up as I have dropped out after the price announcement.,ineosgrenadier

"so, I think the stock rack mounts are pretty bad, based on my test drive. (they flat out remove the skin on the back of your hand if you still use the grab handle). 

the Kenya Grenadier channel had an interview with a swiss accessory maker who was going to use the grab handles themselves as the mounts, which seemed nice and easy to work with. 

Personally, I plan to get the rack and eventually make my own mounts for it that clearance my hands a bit better. I gave feedback to the grenadier team during my drive about their mount design and their answer was ""the aftermarket will solve this"". 

Secondarily, I've messaged Prinsu, to see if they have any plans for a grenadier rack and Haven't gotten any response.

"I am considering the Hybrid Sequoia TRD Pro, or trying to purchase OEM 3rd row seats and putting them in a Hybrid GX550 Overtrail + when they eventually release. The both share the same platform as the 300 series that is unfortunately not available in the US but have variances in dimensions.  


My backup plan is purchasing a used 2020+ LX570 then installing lockers and Werewolf portals so I can run 37""s, still have all the offroad software capabilities, keep the 3rd row, and retain the smooth hydraulic suspension. The tradeoff would of course be very poor fuel economy.",ineosgrenadier
"This is correct; I have a Rivian R1T and an EMC Wolf already. The Grenadier would be a potential replacement for my Wolf, or just an extra ""fun"" car for weekends and around town. I could justify the cost 18mos ago, but now I'm struggling to tie up the capital for a 2nd fun weekend car. It seems excessive in light of what's going on economically.",ineosgrenadier
The seating in my 200 is very spacious. It looked a good bit smaller in the Grenadier,ineosgrenadier

That's a pretty penny.,ineosgrenadier

"It depends how and who they partner with. I'd look at a little more established start up such as Rivian. They're partnered with Chase and do a percentage plus to take an additional cut.

"It was like basically seeing a unicorn. I literally didn’t believe my eyes.   
  
Honestly, I never thought the Grenadier would happen. A vanity project for a 70 year old British billionaire with no car manufacturing experience, who was sad/mad that Land Rover stopped making the old Defender.   
  
It was rainy and gloomy this morning. I had other stuff on my mind. I glanced at a boxy blue truck and though “just another G-wagen” but something was off.  I'd never seen a G-wagon that color. It wasn’t tall and upright enough to be a G-wagen. 

I looked against and it looked like a Grenadier but I was like “no. Can’t be. Must be an old Series III or Defender that someone spent $20,000 repainting and putting LED headlights in.”  But no, it still didn’t look quite right. “Could be one of those Spanish Santana trucks or another foreign licensee or copy, that someone imported and tarted up. They have fooled me before.”  No, that wasn’t it either.   
  
I managed to snap some pictures and damn if it’s not a Grenadier.   
  
It’s not only the “first one I’ve seen” it’s the first I even knew was in America. And it was a few miles from my house in High Point, North Carolina.  Some quick googling revealed that the Bentley dealership has become an Ineos dealer.",ineosgrenadier

"Happy to share. I'm big critic of the legacy dealership allocation model. 

It's nice that Jeep/Dodge has allowed volume dealers to circumvent allocations  on customer orders (to the benefit of the customer). I wish Toyota and others would follow suit.

It sounds like Ineos is attempting something similar (fixed dealership pricing, orders tied to the customer). I wish them the best in their endeavor.",ineosgrenadier
"Thank you! I’m looking at aftermarket wheels and I couldn’t figure out stock offset. 

Another question - does the storage lockbox for the spare work with aftermarket wheels or is it something that will only work with the stock steelies?",ineosgrenadier
This is very interesting. I’m curious about the longevity of these!!!,ineosgrenadier
"The more feedback I read, the more I'm convinced that the only people who can afford this thing are luxury car drivers, and that population often has no clue what a truck is. Whatever, I'm not worried. Here's to a December delivery!",ineosgrenadier
Mossy in San Diego is who you want,ineosgrenadier
No hitch option?,ineosgrenadier
Can confirm it was the cable. Bought a genuine Samsung c to c cable and it works now,ineosgrenadier
"Yikes, accessories are to be installed by local dealers and price negotiated with them. I would assume the sale of the part is accurate on the site. But this is not going to be factory installed so labor will be charged in addition here. I assume many people will be busting out their tools and putting things on them selves. hope they get the instructions of the build and parts online. Has it even been released in Europe yet. Be interested to see the Cad.

There is also no guarantee that dealerships won't markup the vehicles or tack on fees.... yikes!",ineosgrenadier
"I'm two hours from my dealer, love the grenadier. Have over 6k miles on it since late Dec.",ineosgrenadier
"Thanks, appreciate it.  Very good fortune you have to be able to take that car on such a grand test drive.",ineosgrenadier
Your pics help with the waiting and the people having cold feet.  Keep em coming.,ineosgrenadier
From what my SA told me you can use lower as it doesn’t come with the “premium only” label but I don’t remember exactly what was said - I think he mentioned it’s preferred to be at 91,ineosgrenadier
"Wow, we are definitely getting screwed considering we have flawless driving records, multiple cars, policies and no claims.",ineosgrenadier
"The Trialmaster I drove in preproduction had solid feeling switches, with the exception of the ignition switch, which felt like the “key” would fall out.

It’s interesting I asked about replacement switches on my test drive and who Ineos sourced them from. My West Coast (California) rep did not know but once mine arrives I will source them and pick up assorted spares.

This will not be my first cottage industry vehicle (if you can call investing $2B in production a cottage industry) and with just 19 dealerships in network my closest will be between 50 and 1000 miles away from where my Trialmaster might find itself at any given time.",ineosgrenadier
What tow hitch issue?,ineosgrenadier
"I think they might be looking at doing a 2.5 or 3 row (as the previous LC was pretty large), so probably something between the 4Runner and Sequoia, or even above Sequoia (thats where the old LC was...)? I think the LC300 is being brought over for the Lexus lineup? I always get that stuff mixed up.",ineosgrenadier
Msrp plus 900 delivery fee. Plus tax and registration,ineosgrenadier
"The new GX looks to fill the luxury off road segment really well. 

I think the more utilitarian USDM Land Cruiser arriving in the US (based on the new GA-F GX and upcoming Land Cruiser Prado) is going to be a winner. I’m cancelling my Grenadier reservation for it.",ineosgrenadier
So my 80 is on ironman springs (gives about 2”) and 35” BFG KO2 but it really drives very nicely around town. It has death wobble at 65 that I haven’t addressed but besides that it’s great. The Ineos honestly requires more effort to drive around town. The LC I can one hand drive with my elbow out the window and the IG feels like it needs more effort. Off-road the feel is great….hell you can go over a speed bump and you feel like it just wants to eat it all up. People are changing out the Ineos steering dampener for an OME one but I’m not ready to do that. It just drives like a truck and I’m ok with that.,ineosgrenadier
lol… why in the world would you mind?,ineosgrenadier
"**A lot of us, including myself, find the Grenadier to be excellent value at 90k-100k!**",ineosgrenadier
"Solid axle architecture is far more robust. The Grenadier has heavy-duty axles, control arms, and steering links. More heavy duty than anything I've ever seen on a stock 4x4. Toyota 4x4s outside of the 70/200/300 aren't built that tough.

Reliability is not the same as robustness, and some people like myself favor the latter, especially since nearly every modern car except outliers are fine in their first 150k miles. If I wanted a 300,000 mile 4x4 I'd absolutely buy a 200 (since I can't buy a 70).",ineosgrenadier
I'm 20 min from a dealer. Just need the money to pay for it. 🤣,ineosgrenadier
"Ah, ok. Thx.",ineosgrenadier
"Yes. You can change direct with Ineos until you are assigned a dealer. After dealer assignment, changes go through them. If you make late changes it may slow down your build.",ineosgrenadier
"I ordered twice but cancelled my order twice because of the footwell. I now own one. The First drive was almost 1000 km and had absolutely no issues with the footwell. I am 6 ft tall, and it is not a problem at all. 

I've owned a 200 series, drove the 300 series and it was so boring. Owned 2 x Next Gen Raptors which were awesome, but I need a wagon. The 250 Series Prado is interesting, I've got a deposit on one so will see what its like when it comes out. 

But for now I am really happy with the Grenadier. Its not for everyone, but for those who it is suited to, you will love it. 

I've now done over 4500 km and apart from some ""quirks"" I'm exceptionally happy with it.",ineosgrenadier
The 14 mpg figure was INEOS needing to give a safe value before it's officially EPa certified. Petrol owners are reporting better economy than that.,ineosgrenadier
So nice! What happened to the person who cancelled it? Did they just not get there $450 back,ineosgrenadier
you get 2 and a card to order more.  if someone tries to use the wrong one it shorts things out.  I keep 1 in the safe.,ineosgrenadier
What kind of MPG do you get when not towing?,ineosgrenadier
"yep, I think they're strongly differentiated, but I think the comparison is good, too. I would bet money that Ineos creates a down-market competitor to this.",ineosgrenadier
"I would really love ""loaner"" parts. e.g. a set of MT tires on some wheels or an extra spare tire that could be borrowed for those going on longer trips that don't want to either own or rock MT on a DD. 

I'd love having a visible stock of accessories, and some more ""in stock"" testing stuff - e.g. trailers, racks, carriers, etc. 

tool lending for repairs would be good, too. I'd love a ""trail map"", too, that the dealer would maintain a list of trails done by grenadiers. 

I'd also say a ""network"" of local owners that had things they could loan to each other. E.g. I have a pretty esoteric trailer that I would be happy to lend to other owners if they needed it. But, sometimes I need a flatbed trailer to move something. 

I think the MTB analogy is great - the old bike shop I used to go to in SF had a great mechanic who was willing to help, and would sell you the stuff you needed. If I could have that, I'd be really really happy.",ineosgrenadier
yes stock size. The tire guys said stay with 17s they are much more common than the 18s.  I should have put the mud tires on the steelies and then new rims on stock tires.  maybe will switch it around later.  Time to see if this lady lives up to the hype.,ineosgrenadier
"Having driven a Gren on the highway, it is good for a 4x4",ineosgrenadier
probably 2-3 years is my guess. its a completely new car design. it took them 4 years to get the grenadier going and part of that was fitting a new factory. They have that now so it's just development time.,ineosgrenadier
I got Q1 2024… im hoping that means Q3 2024 delivery,ineosgrenadier
"Note that besides the new 250 Series Land Cruiser, Toyota also made some modest updates to the 70 Series. Info and pics on [https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/toyota/39526684.html](https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/toyota/39526684.html)

Mostly aesthetic changes, but a 4-cylinder engine and automatic transmission will be available. Will also be sold in Japan for the first time in a long while.",ineosgrenadier
The last news they said about delivery is that it will be December of this year starting. That could mean anywhere as low as 1 car delivered. Its safe to say the majority of people will get there’s next year some time. As for the advanced breaking and stuff I heard it was not going to be added but in the US. But the brochure under safety at some point did mention it but it’s not in the updated brochure anymore. Legally every new car in the USA is suppose to have it. But I think they were able to fall under some loop hole maybe cause it’s a small run.,ineosgrenadier
I bailed right after they announced pricing. The value proposition versus other vehicles in that price range never made sense to me. I've been quite happy with my Land Rover purchase instead. I'd no doubt still be waiting for my Grenadier.,ineosgrenadier
I called. They said first week of September to hear more.,ineosgrenadier
Mine showed up at the dealer last week and the sales guy was offered cash to call me to see if I'd let them take delivery for $20k. So it's a thing if you want to.....I'm curious what one would bring on bring a trailer.....especially one of the first few. I'm guessing 35-50 over. But the window of time for that will be small.,ineosgrenadier

"I have a Grenny. Did test drive a defender. I couldn't have described the comparison better than this post. Re squeaks and rattles, none. The grenadier is one of the quietest interiors I've been in. There is plastic in places on the outside that I wouldn't have expected but don't really notice. The cockpit area is solid.",ineosgrenadier
"So I’m a 5hrs drive for service until Nashville dealership opens and then I’ll be 3hr. I picked mine up in Dec and daily drive it. I have an 80 series LC and my old daily was a Mercedes CLS that I sold to get this. Needless to say I didn’t need this car at all. But let me tell you I have never had so much fun with a new car. I have a smile on my face every time I drive it. It does have faults and is not practical at all. The GX overtrail would be a much better everyday car. But there will be a million of those in town and you’ll be one of a few if you get this. Service wise my import mechanic in town said he’ll work on it so I really only have to worry about computer updates. I’m planning a Braves game to justify the drive once a year for this. Life is short so to me it’s ok to go make a decision like this every once and awhile. I say go for it.not because you have to have the ruggedness this offers over other choice, but because you’ll have more FUN.",ineosgrenadier
I meant relative to the defender. The new defender looks like it tapers a lot on the sides.,ineosgrenadier

"Spoke with my INEOS Dealer. Those ETA’s aren’t accurate and will be updated in weeks. They’ve had vehicles arrive that say ETA July. Best thing to do is ask your dealer if the truck shows as editable in their portal. If it’s not editable it’s somewhere less than 60 days to production. After it’s made it’s roughly another 60 days. 

So basically if yours day be edited, it’s 60 days + x + 60 days.  If it can’t be edited it’s 60 days - x + 60 days. If it has a VIN, it’s built and just 60 days or less

Hope that helps!",ineosgrenadier

"It’s always smarter financially to find a good used vehicle . It will not go up in price in the next decade on the used market. Or hold its value anytime soon like a vintage defender. If the idea that the grenadier is as reliable and as enduring then having it second hand will be great. There will be a a small group of people who will depend on the Grenadier and use it as attended and hold on to it forever. But I would say half to the majority people just want the new cool factor, the vintage looks. But would sell it when there is a better update to it or something else comes along. The off-road suv market is really doing well right now. So I expect better alternatives to come along. As well as the industry shift to hybrid and electric. There is debate from hardcore off road enthusiasts about that shift but something to consider with depreciation , the market shift with technology etc. it may hold more value. Also consider the issues the grenadier  been having that have not been resolved a year later with electronics and warning lights that people have been ignoring. Which is dangerous in my opinion as the fix right now is to ignore them. The US is also having deliveries delayed because of the safety features necessary to be on all vehicles. Seemed like it was rushed to be put on. So if those don’t get fixed then I would say the depreciation would be pretty high as people would want to upgrade or wait for the newer models.

For me a starting price of over £60k is going to put me off, which is sad as I'd love an EV 4x4 and I don't want to own more than one car.

"Personally this was a deal breaker for me as our stories are similar, and having come from LC's in the past that had that leg room for my left leg I just knew I'd be uncomfortable after a few hours. 

I agree its a shame, but all 4wd's are about compromise. There were only 2 things I dislike about the Grenadier, the instrument cluster and the foot well for RHD. That being said, everything else points to it being a great 4wd (and I agree that in stock form its solid) and it really depends on what you want to compromise on.

"Take my money!! I agree that it could look better but it's not a crossover type thing which I was expecting tbh. And smaller than the Grenadier but not too small. 

I'd definitely want the full EV but I think a range extended version is a good idea. Far better than the PHEVs we have on the market already regardless of being 4x4. A lot of people will appreciate the EV for commuting and around the farm etc, then a dash of petrol for longer road trips and overlanding will still make for a very efficient, low-running-cost vehicle.

Edit: Oof starting at £90k supposedly. I know EVs cost more but that's a lot of money. I don't know if I'd want to off road in a car so expensive.",ineosgrenadier

I agree with this review. It’s honest and accurate to how I felt. It’s hard to justify the cost. And it seems like it’s inflated from my guess partnerships with all the manufacturing components. The expensive high tech plant and not getting investors for growth which most car companies do. Instead passing on that startup cost to first edition buyers. It just doesn’t make sense. Enthusiastic buyers won’t care. But from what I saw in the prototype to what was actually out in the roads they didn’t make any changes. So the build quality is unfortunately lacking in the interior. People will say well it’s not suppose to be posh and fit on the inside. But when you’re spending 90k there needs to be some expectations on refinement. Cars half the price have better interior build quality. Like you said look what you can buy for the money. The Porsche is not the same use case but still a bar in which it can be compared purpose built suv but have the fit comparable to price. People saying off-road cars are noisy. This is just an acceptance of previous older cheape cars. It’s 2023 new defenders aren’t noisy on the road nor is a g wagon. And it should be compared to them cause it’s not a 50k jeep with plastic roofs.,ineosgrenadier

"I think the Grenadier will likely shine the most as a workhorse rather than as a competitive off roader, mainly due to its cargo capacity.

Off-roading is part of my line of work, and, despite the raw capability of a Wrangler Rubicon or even a modestly modified base model Wrangler, I rarely see them being used in the field due to their lack of useable space and relatively low payload weight. That is where the Grenadier beats the Wrangler in spades.

While it would take a lot more work to get one to be quite as *capable* as a Wrangler, a Grenadier with some disconnecting sway bar links, a modest lift with longer control arms, and 35’s wouldn’t be anything to sneeze at off road and would IMO be more *useful* due to significantly greater amount of stuff it can haul.",ineosgrenadier

The Grenadier, while roomier, still has a very similar footprint and viable climbing data of the older Defenders with great quality. Yes, there are some creature comforts that you would typically not want on a Safari vehicle, but until you hit the mountains of Colorado and roll this thing over 14 times or straddle the Outback dingo fence for 2 months, every person here will enjoy those creature comforts the same as I will.",ineosgrenadier

With that said you can drive it in reverse with door open  but their is a sequence to follow.  You have to put it in reverse and open your door.  The car will go into park.  Do not shut the door.

"I thought this video was informative and just sharing. Honestly there’s been a lot of misinformation from what was said from ineos and what is actually being done. Like being told some fit and finish things would be improved upon the actual production and not actually done. The electrical issues I didn’t even mention here. The first two years of the new defender had electrical issues but they really ironed it out. So I’m sure ineos will. There are people on the forum driving the car for a couple of hundred miles that should have charged up the battery and still have issues with warning issues. I doubt it’s as simple as a low bat. Even though I have ordered a defender. Im still keeping up on ineos as I’ll probably now wait to see about the pick up and hopefully work through the growing pains by then. If someone else has posted this I would find it helpful in deciding my purchase. There is almost no one on Reddit talking about the electrical issues. Its either nothing or a really big problem. Which I think should be an important point of discussion. What’s happening, How to fix, what’s the service saying to do. That’s what sharing in the community is about. Not everyone can spend all day reading forums or watch YouTube videos.

Edit.

"So just to follow up on the test drive - and thanks to everyone who pointed out things to look out for.

The vehicle i got to drive was a Sela Green Trailmaster.  Single turbo diesel model.

Straight up - the RHD ""Foot rest"" is pretty chunky, but it didn't worry me at all.  After a while it just felt like my foot was sitting flat.  That said, i did try and stretch my legs out like i would on a long car trip and there is limited space in the footwell for doing that.  It wouldn't stop me from buying one.

Head room for me at 6'3"" was fine.  The vehicle was fitted with safari windows which give even more clearance but even without them head room wouldnt have been an issue.

The quality of reversing camera is pretty crap.  Resolution is low and the screen size is small. 

Rear view mirrors also seems small to me.  The B Pillar is quite large (compared to my Prado)  when doing shoulder checks but seems to be positioned slightly forwards (relative to the prado) so you can still see out the rear passenger window.

I'm not used to powerful cars so to me it felt like it had plenty of get up and go.  I actually had trouble accelerating smoothly - like it took a lot of careful conscious effort to take off slowly.  

I didn't notice any power steering noise or engine whine.  I also didn't notice the more passive steering that people talk about.  Not saying it's not present - it just wasn't such an issue that i noticed it.

Seating was very comfy, i loved the utalitarian nature of the interior switch panels.  Quality of construction seemed top notch as people mention.  That said the switch panels seemed kinda flimsy?  Rear passenger seating seemed roomy.  Rear cargo section seemed narrower but taller than the Prado i'm used to.  

I really enjoyed it but didn't walk away as smitten as i thought i might.  I would love to buy one, and probably will when i find myself in the market - which will be when work stops giving me a LC Prado to drive everywhere.

Prado platform has always been light duty, regardless of the towing numbers. In reality, when towing a decent sized trailer, you will need a gvm upgrade because the tow ball weight and additional accessories easily surpass the max limits.

I listened to the stereo in the prototype using CarPlay and streaming some music.  It’s not a bad stereo, but it’s also nothing really special.  It’s clear, it can play at a good level and it has sone good mid-bass punch to it.  However it has no real bass, lacks crisp treble and if you really like a good stereo to jam out on, you’ll likely want more.  It sounds like a lot of stock stereos - it’s serviceable, but not audiophile.  Hope that helps.",ineosgrenadier

"I wasnt in a huge rush for the vehicle because gen1 cars always have issues so i reserved and pre-ordered very late. My build window is January of next year with delivery likely in May/June. 

I asked and they said it will be Ineos that will help finance but they dont have any other specifics but will pose the question to Ineos when they follow up in the next few days. 

The dealer was asking if i would be willing to pick up any preorders that other people cancel and i told him it depends how the test drive goes. I didnt get to go to the test drives they had off road. An interesting bit from him was that the vehicles they are receiving is meant for on road test drives and “no plans” for off roading.

"I think new GX/Prado shares the same platform as LC 300 actually (but still should be ""simplified"" in some terms). It would be good to have detailed comparison for sure..  


Old LC Prado / ""regular"" LC had different platform for sure (and Prado platform was reused in 4Runner / FJ). Also it's interesting to say that current generation of Prado (J150) is sold as just ""Land Cruiser"" in the Europe. So, probably, Toyota is going to sell Prado in US which will be named just ""Land Cruiser"" but will be completely different from LC 300 (I am not sure but it's my assumption).",ineosgrenadier

You basically wrote how I felt after my test drive back in spring and when they announced pricing over the summer. I don’t believe we will see the grenadier having a significant update for years to come. The quarter master will be out and on the road in realistically two years. And after that a smaller grenadier in 5 years. After that I’m guessing a refresh for the grenadier. At that point prices will probably drop for the broader market. Or they will need to be relevant to thee every day market and work on amenities and luxury. To appeal more and keep the pricing high. They could get military contracts and rebuild them with more room for military use. Also newer cars from other brands will also have play on consumer choices.,ineosgrenadier
"Yes. Volvo XC40. And / but we vetted new defenders, broncos, Macans, before settling on the Volvo and waiting to see what Ineos actually delivered.

What was the damage.?,ineosgrenadier
"8K deliveries in NA only. Don’t know the global numbers. Will look for it. Interested personally. 
All new vehicles tend to have issues during introduction. 
No one knows where the numbers will go. We are all hoping higher as the vehicle starts getting tested more thoroughly and hits all of its supposed points. 

My 2 different Cayennes had a recall and collective lawsuit some years ago for a plastic part in the engine that kept melting and stopping the engine, imagine that. So they replaced it with an aluminium part.  Yes there was a recall.
We could say, how dare Porsche with all the years of manufacturing top class vehicles make such a mistake. 
I am therefore giving Ineos a break on an instrument panel or speed warning light, which is required in E.U. but not in the US. 
They made one global vehicle and have to make changes depending on the region. Relax guys. 

As it performs like a GWagon, (less price) with Land Rover capabilities, (and similarities) it brings back memories from my childhood in my father’s 110 Rover - 40yrs ago. And with new engine components!! Who can ask for more. 

My 2 cents, it performs well and increases in price. Look at the reviews from the Aussy guy (who Ineos wouldn’t give a vehicle too so a customer loaned him one) and other E.U. writers who are now getting their hands on the vehicle. Pay attention then go look up the first time Range Rover or Land Rover entered the US markets. 

Any differences? No. 

Yes a new model with updated specs might come out in 3 yrs. increasing the older models is my take. 

Rest my case.",ineosgrenadier

"Lol, okay, here goes. Warning: I’m passionate about this and still very upset!

The “Land Cruiser” in America has always been the top of the line SUV from Toyota, plus a slightly fancier version with mostly window dressing bling in Lexus form starting in 1997. It’s always been overbuilt in a way that you could literally drive one around the world a few times on the roughest roads imaginable. One of Toyota’s goals when building it was “this vehicle will go to the ends of the earth in comfort and last a minimum of 30 years with basic maintenance”. People don’t even begin worrying about mileage until they start pushing 300,000 miles and it’s got godlike status amongst the overlanding community. The lineage began (leaving out some minor models) 40 Series from 1960, 50 Series, 80 Series, 100 Series, 200 Series and then the 300 Series most recently came out in 2021.
For some reason known only to Toyota the USA isn’t allowed and apparently never will get the 300 which is the first and biggest problem.

(Caveat: You can get a 300 Series in the US as the Lexus LX600 which is more expensive for not much reason, way too shiny/blingy and not at all off-roady/trucky. And the front end is deeply offensively ugly. It’s (an ugly) Range Rover vs a Defender and doesn’t get really cross-shopped)

What we are getting with the LC250 “Land Cruiser” next year is what the rest of the world has always known as the Light Duty Land Cruiser, called the Land Cruiser Prado since 1990. In the rest of the world it has always been sold alongside the “Heavy Duty” 300 Series kind of in the same vein as the Bronco and Bronco Sport. In the Prado’s defense, it and it’s big brother are closer in capability than the Broncos and it’s a fine vehicle in its own right. We have actually had the Prado here in the US as the Lexus GX series since I think the early 2000’s and it’s pretty great, but it’s not a “Land Cruiser” which is the second problem because starting next year the new Land Cruiser Prado that the rest of the world gets will be sold here in America as “The Land Cruiser” which is bullshit.

So those of us that care were already mad that we can’t get a 300 Series true Land Cruiser and now they are telling us the Prado is now our Land Cruiser. Well, it just isn’t.

Beyond the semantics which is really just raging at not getting a 300 here there are several other things that pushed the dissatisfaction deeper. We already knew it was going to be a little smaller, not be as stupidly/awesomely overbuilt and with cheaper parts overall but we were hoping a few of the true Land Cruiser staples would get added in. But no, it doesn’t get the split tailgate or front locker. We figured there wouldn’t be a V8 but you can’t even get one with a V6. The only engine option is a hybrid V4 which is probably fine in a lot of ways and gets good gas mileage but it’s heavy (not great for trails), more complex and won’t tow as well. AND the battery pack for the hybrid is in the rear cargo floor, raising it up several inches and taking up space, making it impossible to have a 3rd row.

What’s even more weird is with these decisions Toyota is just going to pirate sales from their own lineup because the Prado LC and the 4Runner are extremely similar, more similar to each other than any other vehicles on the market. Except the 4Runner can have a 3rd row and non-hybrid engine. And while it also doesn’t have a split tailgate it does have a rear window that slides down into the tailgate which is awesome on sunny days.

TLDR: The new USA Land Cruiser PRADO is fine but for those of us who want a 300 Series it’s infuriating.

The other important takeaway from this, if you can stomach any more impassioned vehicle advice, is the Prado is remaining in the Lexus lineup as the GX550. It’s the same platform as the Prado but you get a twin turbo V6 and can have a 3rd row if you want it. It’s a different look, less trucky, but I personally think it looks better than the LC250 which looks a little cheap. So if you like the idea of the Land Cruiser I think the Lexus version is the one to get.

I don’t know what the ineos traction control is going to be like. My guess is that it will be a lot more minimal than what is in the defender, since the defender requires it to work and ineos has really focused on “natural traction” via solid axles and lockers.

"Drove one and loved it, but due to a total custerf$&k in trying to order one with my local dealer and corporate unclear if the vehicle actually existed (VIN# was missing), I don’t have any confidence in their supply chain and ability to get parts and service in the near term.

PS: I’m in California USA",ineosgrenadier
Interesting. I would think the Prado would compete directly with the 4Runner unless they are planning to replace the 4Runner name with Land Cruiser? Or 4Runner will be more basic and the Prado will only be available in the upper luxury trims? (Kinda like they did with the Sequoia & the LC200),ineosgrenadier

"Well, I don’t know what’s happening in northern California to answer my own question but I sent my sales rep an email this morning. Just inquiring about my order and I got some kind of cryptic email back saying that they are, “working with INEOS Americas on the startup of the NorCal location”. 

I was under the impression they started that operation in the fall of 2023. I met the crew, took an offsite test drive and communicated extensively with the GM of the Northern California location. 

Apparently that relationship is up in the air. Hopefully they work it out. I don’t really care where I pick my car up infected probably like to pick it up in South Dakota or I may end up titling it for use in Baja.",ineosgrenadier
"I'm 6'5"" with a longer torso. I fit fine in the driver seat (LHD version), although I'd like better sight lines off the sides as my eyes were level with the door frame.

For the record, I do not fit in a 200-series Landcruiser (2008-2021) as there's not enough headroom with the sunroof. 

The upcoming North America Landcruiser will be based on the GX and Prado, so a smaller package than the 200 and 300-series. I've seen versions without moon or sunroof, which makes me hopeful I'll be able to fit safely.",ineosgrenadier
"Yeah $71k would be a dream if it even was what people wanted. They knew it all along, and you should already know if you've looked at the config tool that the vehicle 'most' people are likely buying is 80k+.",ineosgrenadier
Its not only in those markets.  It's just on the right side . So it only affects the driver in RHD markets. In NA driver is on the left side so not as big of a deal for a passenger to deal with it.  If i recall is a hump for transmission clearance?,ineosgrenadier

Yep. I am trying to convince my boyfriend of that. He’s a hunter so it would make sense.,ineosgrenadier
No I think 35 would fit,ineosgrenadier
"Looking at other world markets, the values aren't exactly skyrocketing, even with constrained supply.  Looks like several ""flippers"" in the UK are just trying to recover their purchase price.  I'd considered taking delivery and seeing if someone else wanted it more than me, but I come back to the pricing.  There's little meat left on the bone north of $80K.  Ineos has a financing partner that is quoting 10% APR.  At that rate, you're looking at a car payment approaching $2k/month for 60 months.  Ouch.  At a house payment price, it pretty much needs to be a daily driver, which brings me back to the driver feature problem...",ineosgrenadier
Nice! What spec?,ineosgrenadier
"The practical 4x4 with a everyday man’s price of 90k+ deserves to fail at this point. I’ve been holding a reservation, did the test drives, loved everything. Then Ineos decided to make us fund their other models. It’s complete bullshit and I’m out. It’s not quite a matter of if I can afford it but if I should. It’s ridiculous and there’s been NOTHING to prove any reliability",ineosgrenadier
To some,ineosgrenadier
"I was talking to someone deep in the California wilderness and they mentioned they brought their Grenadier. I was shocked. I had no clue they existed for real either, but there it was. He only had 800 miles on it, so I guess they’re slowly trickling out.",ineosgrenadier

So to say I was waiting on a vehicle like this is an understatement. I for one, I am enjoying the Grenadier.

"I think the size is good, though. I thought the 100 series was peak LC. After that, the 200 just got kinda fat. 

I’m kinda sad that you have to buy the GX to get the 8k towing, though. I would bet the power/torque numbers from this drivetrain they are quoting are “conditional”.",ineosgrenadier

"Every new car I ever purchased I told the dealer “no dealer stickers, emblems, or license plates.”  If they put them on anyway, I removed them as soon as I got home. 

Once, a dealer drilled holes and mounted the front license plate mount so they could tack on the tacky dealer ad plate onto a new Mustang GT convertible.  Once I saw it, I told them I would not buy the car and walked out. 
( front license plates are not required where I live) 

If they want me to be a billboard for their dealership, they need to pay me royalties.",ineosgrenadier
"Are we talking about the new USA mini-Land Cruiser with the hybrid 2.4 turbo? If so, is anyone really cross shopping a base price $50k vehicle with a base price $70k? Pricewise is makes more sense to compare with the new Lexus GX 550 although it's really just a tarted up Land Cruiser. 

The wonderful B58 inline-6 BMW engine with the stellar ZF transmission (with thankfully no hybrid) in the Grenadier weighs heavily in its favor. Toyota of course has the huge advantage of being a known for producing reliable vehicles. Ineos on the other hand is a total question mark and more likely than not will have a higher rate of QC and warranty issues.",ineosgrenadier
I would be to scared to lose the thing LOL,ineosgrenadier
If you ordered one with a tow hitch in the US it was removed at the port due to software issues that prevented the trailer wiring from working properly.   Their solution was to remove it so you couldn’t even use it as a bike carrier.  New Grenadiers are now being delivered with the hitch and software updates but those that originally ordered the hitch are still waiting.,ineosgrenadier
"Don't disagree but people are saying I a am passing on one because the service dealer for me is 5 hours away and blah,  blah,  blah.   What I'm saying is if the distance is a pain then service it at your local BMW or neighborhood garage.",ineosgrenadier
"The LC, just because it has an instrument cluster, HUD and adaptive cruise control.

"I'm 178cm. I found the seats to be okay for me, I've only been in the car driving for 2 hours as I'm still waiting for delivery. I think the seat is just okay but not fantastic. It will work for me for now but I may replace it in the future for a more ergonomic seat. I have a back issue so I'm a bit picky with my seat and posture.

If anything my complaint is on the seat belt. I wish it was 2 inches longer so I can reach over the steering wheel and get close to the windshield with my hand before the seatbelt stops me. I think this seat belt is 2 inches shorter than most other cars excluding German cars which tend to be the same. I will likely change the belt to a longer belt.",ineosgrenadier
"4.9something through my credit union after some incentives.

Got mine. Q4 2023. Trail master with half roof rack and safari windows. White.,ineosgrenadier
I went back to the configuration to look at the roof rack that they offer as part of the build and it appears to me that it uses the same rail.  It shouldn’t be flexible like that.  Makes me wonder if that Thule rack needs to be adjusted for width because it might be forcing the rail out.,ineosgrenadier
How much does it help so far?,ineosgrenadier
"It sure doesn’t! But, if you got the base LC 1958, did 1.5k on tires, kept stock wheels, added 2k rack, pulled stock suspension off and added kings for 4k, and then found a place to put a ladder? For another 1k. You’d be at 8.5k minimum. You may be worse off, but we just don’t know yet. No mention of body mount chop, etc. not sure if you’d need other offsets and then new wheels. 

It’ll be cheaper, but, then it also won’t be stock and that comes with all its own kinda of pain.",ineosgrenadier
"Those look awesome, thanks for posting.  What width and offset are those wheels?",ineosgrenadier
"I'd think even October will be optimistic. They are shutting down for French summer break. When they ramp back up emphasis will be in the first 5k or so North American orders.

Don't kick yourself. Everything I have seen from Ineos is quality but the aftermarket will find ways to improve one the breed. I left the winch off my order but talking to my dealer during my test drive my dealer assured me adding it was not a big deal.  I am still on the fence regarding the winch.,ineosgrenadier
The foorpack on the rhino rack fits different than front runner and Thule.  Rhino made a new footpack that sits closer to roof.  Where as Thule and frontrunner seem to clamp on the outside more.   From conversation the rhino doesn't have the same flex.  I personally will be going with Black Sheep.,ineosgrenadier

I agree I think people will purchase thinking they will be happy with it as a daily driver.. then a year later finally admit to themselves that it’s fine as an off roader but sucks to daily and depreciation will align with the used car market at large,ineosgrenadier
"If they are being sold for MSRP and demand is high, you can count on flippers.   Also, dealers have plenty of customers who would buy them at sticker and then ‘trade them back in’ so the dealer can sell them marked up as pre-owned vehicle.",ineosgrenadier

My dealership in PA said they could do it as they work with wrap companies for their other luxury vehicles which get full wraps. We discussed colors and they indicated they could help.,ineosgrenadier
Is the issue only with some of the US deliveries? What is the specific issue?,ineosgrenadier
"Spoke to my dealer today. Expect demo vehicles in 6 weeks. Couldn’t confirm a delivery date of my order or talk what financing does or does not look like. They were great, super excited but proactively said they are still getting up to speed on details and things. That said, they called me today which was the day I was told I would hear from them. So that’s a plus in my book. And I got to speak to two humans live.

And I have to imagine I’m near top of pre order list. Put my order in the second I was able to. 

Anyway, as the other commenter said, some vehicles are expected in November but I’m kind of doubtful of that. Mine specifically says “in production”. The fact they couldn’t give me a real date or talk about payment have me cause on that timeline.",ineosgrenadier

""Interested in lease and loan programs from INEOS Automotive Finance? When we announce our network later in 2023, your retail partner will be able to tell you more.""

I'm guessing there aren't going to be any real financing incentives since they have more demand than supply. Will probably be cheaper to use a local bank...although I don't know if weird things go on with brand new vehicles and manufacturers.",ineosgrenadier
"Buddy, I would gladly take the finance option at 6%, if my invested capital is bringing me a return of 10%. It’s called a **spread**.

And to your point about cancelation rate, I ask that question since it’s important for me to only accept delivery of my Grenadier in 2024 (not 2023) for tax write off purposes, as the Grenadier is a Section 179 deduction on my business.",ineosgrenadier
Ughhh. If I still have nothing do we know if that means I'll be waiting an eternity or that my dealer needs to release the info?,ineosgrenadier

This vehicle is so new that you’re really paving the way here for others. If it were me. I would look into other rigs that other people have made. Once you look around a bit you start to see common things people use and research why they use those. And you’ll slowly educate yourself self on what’s best and what can work best for your set up. Also working closely with a good reputable mechanic for off-roading setups can save you a ton of work. Pay them a retainer so they would be happy to help and answer your questions and teach you what’s going on with limitations and modifications. Because the grenadier is on a ladder frame.
