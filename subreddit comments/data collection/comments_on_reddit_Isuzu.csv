"Just some questions, guy mentioned the engine was replaced/ rebuilt with 70k miles on it. There‚Äôs no undercarriage rust, and the car drives good. 
Does the engine look replaced?
Any advice on what I should do first? 
What should I be looking forward to?
Anything else you have to offer appreciate the help",Isuzu
"P2002 is Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) below efficiency or some such.  Essentially it's telling you that the DPF is clogged and not working correctly.  The DPF differential pressure sensor measures the pressure pre filter and if it's higher than the preset value it initiates a burn cycle to return the filter pressure to the expected value.

So either the filter is clogged and not cleaning properly in a burn cycle or the sensor is faulty.  It is located on the driver's side of the engine on a bracket just below the Air filter box.

Edited: To add that these sensors are known to be unreliable and should be changed by the dealer as I believe IUA has extended the warranty period",Isuzu
DM me if you end up putting out a listing or have more media! Definitely interested,Isuzu
The amount of money you'd spend you might as well get a 4x4 model instead. It takes more than just the gearbox,Isuzu
"It is far beyond just the transmission and pedals. This is a rough list of what you‚Äôd need for that swap: 
Transmission, Transfer Case, Rear Drive shaft, front drive shaft, cv axles, front differential, upper and lower control arms, steering knuckles, wheel hubs, tie rods, and ball joints.  I‚Äôm probably missing some parts there. 

Once you have the parts together you would have to replace the transmission and assembly with transfer case, cut a new hole in the tunnel of your rig to adapt the t-case shifter into, then completely remove your front end assembly, locate and weld on new brackets to hold your front differential in place, then reassemble the front end and hopefully it drives straight. 

Ive done 4x4 swaps. It‚Äôs a doable project. But an absolutely massive one. It would cost far less money to sell your rig and buy a 4x4 model.",Isuzu
Awesome,Isuzu
Sounds like the beep when you try to lock the doors with one or more doors still open,Isuzu
Yeah that would be the only concern-go with t6 rotella 5w40 instead of,Isuzu
"Noice!!
I miss my ‚Äò90 SpaceCab, 2.6L 5speed.
Sold it in my youth once marriage and kids came along.
Big regret‚Ä¶. Now in my 50s trying to find one again ‚Ä¶ so much fun to drive",Isuzu
4K and losing compression that would be a hard pass for me unless you could get it way cheaper.,Isuzu
"personally, i‚Äôd say fight for 1800, but solid find either way looks in good enough condition and isn‚Äôt rusting to death. almost makes me want to go get another one lmfao",Isuzu
"I haven't worked on the 4J, but the leaks look like oil pan and power steering pump to me.

  


These old trucks leak oil, if it runs well - send it. Just top off the oil as it burns and leaks, and try to fix the leaks as you can.",Isuzu
"Already putting it to work!

Looks really clean! If you plan on doing a swap, I would skip adding power to the stock engine. Its just not gonna be worth it, minimal gains for a lot of time researching and money finding what works. An SBC swap would be awesome!",Isuzu
We learned with my 2000 rodeo and 98 trooper that everything was modular and if you were willing to spend the money you could have it done in an hour flat depending on your skill. Mine was the 3.2l v6 though I'm not sure how the 2.2l was set up so I can't guarantee it'd be as easy.,Isuzu
"See lots of info for rodeo, trooper, amigo, but not as much for the pickup. Lots of resources, a lot to learn lol",Isuzu
technically it was built by holden,Isuzu
Ty,Isuzu
"9k is a little high. In my opinion, these trucks are awesome (amazing, SO FUN) as second cars, but if you overheat the 4ZE1 in Utah heat and it‚Äôs your daily, you might be stuck for a while.

Finding parts can be a chore for these motors, but they‚Äôre great if taken care of and kept at temp. They were originally meant for tractors and generators, so don‚Äôt expect a bunch of oomph. 

They lack creature comforts. A 4 hour drive will be loud and slow. 

Although 9k is high, these trucks (1st gen Amigos, Troopers) etc are only going up in value as they fall into the perfect age for retro hype. Who knows, aftermarket parts availability may even get *better* over time. In the end, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs probably a better buy closer to 6-7k considering the cool factor. But if the extra 2k premium is worth it for you to have this as your baby, we aren‚Äôt here to stop you‚Äîjust know you‚Äôre overpaying!

I have an 89 Trooper that‚Äôs been awesome, same motor as this Amigo. planetisuzoo.com has been an invaluable resource, so if you end up getting her come on over and say hi!",Isuzu
So the funny thing I looked at my fuses already and where it says the fuel pump fuse is there is nothing and I mean nothing,Isuzu
I think it takes a little over 3 quarts of 5w30 if it's the NV1500 transmission.,Isuzu
I have put over 8k in parts for my 98 amigo over the years. Consumables just wear out. I don't regret any of my expenditures because of all the adventures I have had with it.,Isuzu
You'll need all of the gaskets.  It's not smart to reuse them.. R&R is pretty straightforward.,Isuzu
"Seconded, skid plate for gas tank",Isuzu
i'm dumb and forgot to ask if its automatic or manual i see its got a tac but mine is automatic and has a tac too,Isuzu
Keep it. It doesn't cost you anything to let it sit and save up and do it's repairs one by one. That's what I'm doing with my VehiCROSS currently. I've had it 3 years and haven't done as much as I've wanted but it's a sentimental vehicle to me and I'm not in a hurry because I'm going to make it right. I had an Amigo that I regret selling every day. You can always find an affordable daily and put this to the side for later!,Isuzu
Is it an auto or manual?,Isuzu
Bay Area thieves spare no regard for any locks lol. I leave my car unlocked with a window rolled down.,Isuzu
"Auto is a no-go, but you won't find a nicer one. My rule is that if you don't know how to work on vehicles on your own, then Isuzu is a no-go.",Isuzu
So fuckin rad,Isuzu
"It sounds like you might have a compression problem such as from a seized/sticky ring or several.

I'd pick up some Liqui-Moly and Lucas fuel injector cleaner.

Compression testing kits are good to own.  
\---

Liqui-Moly makes a product for this purpose, to clean gunk out of your engine, which should free the lifters and rings, but the oil farm trick is to put kerosene in the oil at about a ratio of 1 part kerosene 4 parts oil, and run until the engine reaches operating temperature, then drain the oil.",Isuzu
They pay pretty good if you pull the motor! Those windings are skrilla!,Isuzu
"What would be a more realistic number in your opinion? I was tallying up the work with one of my buddies, if he did it all himself, the guy easily out $5k into preventative maintenance in the past few years",Isuzu
"Mine was typically a quart every 500-1000 miles depending on driving conditions. 

I ended up using the same conventional castrol oil that i put in my RX7 because it burns well.",Isuzu
"I may have seen this Trooper for sale in AZ a few months back, not running.  Does it happen to be a blue color ""SE""?  If so, I'm glad to hear someone got it running...at least partially!",Isuzu
the 5sp troopers are few and far between. Most have been gobbled up. Be patient and one will appear.,Isuzu
That is EPIC and exactly the isuzu spirit!!!! she is going to love that ride and it is a great first car (durable / safe / not too sporty) for a first driver!,Isuzu
Thank you. Is this supposed to be dangling?,Isuzu
Looks good. Did you do a diff drop? Did you get the Heavy Duty torsion bars?,Isuzu
"They are good cars, but like any car of this age things will need to be replaced. 1998-1999 are slightly different than the later ones 2000-2002, 2003-2004, but aren't hard to find parts for. 

I have a 2001 LS, and am on my third automatic transmission (if fluid changes are religious they can last, else they are a tossup). The manuals are pretty reliable from what I've heard.

For offroading they are super underrated. The LSD in the rear really helps, and it'll go places you wouldn't expect.

As for parts, I haven't had much difficulty sourcing any. All could be found on Amazon/local parts stores, and weren't particularly expensive.

As for repair support, they are pretty simple trucks. Any competent general mechanic can work on them, excluding rebuilding the transmission/engine. Mine burns some oil, but has taken me on a lot of adventures. A few aftermarket parts are available if you want to go the overlanding route like I did (kinda small for long trips tbh). 

Overall, I like the car, but it won't be trouble free (most 24 year old cars aren't), but I wouldn't expect anything too crazy as long as it's been maintained.",Isuzu
"Vehicross was available in the UK, Australia, and NZ as well. I can't remember if there was a JDM version but I suspect there might have been.",Isuzu
"Goddamn son. 

Wish my 99 was that clean. 

I wanna see that undercarriage. 

How far have you gone with the mods?",Isuzu
"I can‚Äôt find anything on the Isuzupartscenter.com website, I‚Äôd give Scott a call and askü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è he‚Äôs helped me find a lot of interesting shit on my 6VD1",Isuzu
"I've driven a heap of these smaller trucks from hire companies here in Oz.  You sit directly over the beam axle and the Japanese have finally worked out how to make springs.  The first big bump nearly fires you through the roof lining.  If I owned/drove one full-time a air seat would be a must.

EDIT: Love the username",Isuzu
Man I am surprised this hasn't sold yet. However Im am interested in seeing this myself. Did you ever go see it in person yourself?,Isuzu
"If you look up Isuzu Amigo in the Salt Lake area in marketplace it‚Äôll pop up for you. Mileage seems off and seller is shady, so it‚Äôs a no-go for me.",Isuzu
You can also just buy a new thermostat housing,Isuzu
"I dont think were big/active enough to matter, most people come here for a specific issue never to be seen again. Just would be cutting off people looking for extra information, unless you can defer to plantisuzoo.com",Isuzu
V6. We figured it out.,Isuzu
We have a 2018 1.9L and are on a regular basis towing our sailing boat (1.6t) on a trailer. Easy going!,Isuzu
Heavy duty torsion bars,Isuzu
"Amigo, an absolute unit",Isuzu
"You need to follow up with your own compression test or have a mechanic do a test before you touch this. If you can't pull head and do it yourself, and you don't know a machine shop in your area, this likely isn't the truck for you because you may be disappointed. For others, they might love the project.",Isuzu
"Thanks! Much appreciated!

Given some of the other issues it has right now, that may end up being a minor thing. Most driving is on-road, and though I know rocks/etc can bounce up, she's got bigger things going. 

Will still mention it once I get her to the shop, and if the cost isn't too bad, I might include it.",Isuzu
The software is the lost up to date one,Isuzu
A nice pick!!!,Isuzu
It‚Äôs blue with a rough paint & rough interior so possibly!,Isuzu
"It‚Äôs super clean and runs perfect. He listed at $4,500 and I tried to talk him down more but $4,200 was the lowest he would go. But for the used market where I live it‚Äôs a really good deal even if it‚Äôs higher than KBB",Isuzu
"I restored a 92‚Äô Amigo and attempted to use it as a daily. I had all-terrains like this one as well. Driving on the highway is loud as hell, it would get very hot in the Texas heat, and the AC had trouble keeping up. The main issue was that I had a 4-hour drive I would make relatively often to see family (every few months), and that was hell. Short in-town drives were a blast. I retired it as my daily and just used it occasionally before I ended up selling it. I still miss it, but my daily was having issues and I wanted something that was newer and more reliable. 

I also think 9k is pretty high, but maybe that‚Äôs just the market now. It does look pretty clean.",Isuzu
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs off a s10 chevy,Isuzu
"It's a check gauges light. Is your car running hot, low on fuel, or oil pressure off?",Isuzu
"Best vehicle you will ever own. I agree with the top post, reseal the canvas. There are replacement soft tops still being produced, or you can do a hard top conversion (I did this). I also agree the Facebook and forum spots are VERY active.",Isuzu
"Gosh, you know it doesn't really have a name lol. Waaay back when I got it, we used to call it Clarence Jr. Because before this one I had an 88 trooper that we called Clarence lol",Isuzu
If the frame is in good condition ( close inspection underneath the car ) this is a steal def buy it,Isuzu
I bought a 2000 rodeo for the same price and. Put 4k into rebuilding it so not that dumb. Haha I refuse to buy these newer vehicles right now they're overpriced and complete garbage. I'll keep this thing till it dies and then probably just engine swap it,Isuzu
"I don't see why it wouldn't be possible, even in Australia there are companies that will electrify any car if you've got the money, complete with the necessary paperwork to be able to drive it on the road.",Isuzu
"Haha well, in that case I would personally ditch the topper. Unless you absolutely need to keep larger stuff dry in the bed, to me they just kill your pickup bed use.",Isuzu
Did you find it?,Isuzu
Did you end up listing it? I‚Äôd love to see more pictures or videos!,Isuzu
"Yeah, details are really slim, and he won‚Äôt share much info about it. Not something I‚Äôm comfortable getting into considering the year and the engine rebuild. Appreciate the comment!",Isuzu
"Try seafoam then maybe running rotella t or something with a ton of detergents.

Some people have gone pretty far to mitigate this problem.",Isuzu
its easier to move stuff when the sky is the limit,Isuzu
Good question. I have the same mirror and driver side light is out. Reminds me of my 2001 Vehicross last year. The 2-rear license plate lights went out and the sockets were all messed up. The sockets would not hold a new bulb. It won't pass inspection. On eBay I got a new LED kit for like $12. I tried but could not install the new kit myself. I was trying from outside the car. My local shop asked $350 to install the kit. I said go ahead. F it. They installed the kit from inside the car by removing the spare wheel. Why didn't I think of that. Rats,Isuzu
"My kid's truck is an 86 but I'll assume it's similar.

Remove air filter housing (wing nut, 2 bolts, hose at the rear. When removing, do so slowly as there is a vacuum line attached to the bottom. Disconnect that and set housing aside.

With a catch pan underneath the vehicle, remove fuel lines to the carb. (2 hoses)

Disconnect electrical connector.

*For this step you'll need a variety of different sized 12mm wrenches*. Remove 4 nuts and washers from the base of the carburetor. This is challenging due to accessibility. (I recommend having a magnet nearby to prevent the nuts and washers from falling into the bottomless void)  Be patient.

Gently pull carb up off 4 studs to create a bit of space.

Remove (and mark for reassembly) vacuum lines.

Clean the mating surface and reverse steps to reinstall.

Again, this is for an 86 on a 1.9 so your experience may vary",Isuzu
"Some vehicles have one that's a pin to let the caliper pivot on. Remove the one bolt and pry that end some and the caliper should swing out, giving room to replace the pads and push the piston back. Upgraded mine years ago to Rodeo stuff. Can't remember the details",Isuzu
"It‚Äôs an automatic he‚Äôs changed a lot on it already & bought it not running but now it runs just rough. He said all cylinders fire so I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs not compression or anything & could just be something dumb? 

As stated it‚Äôs an Arizona Vehicle so rust is very slim to none unless it came from up north with snow & salt. 

I really think the chances are it‚Äôs a vacuum line or something so minor being the Heat loves to eat at Vacuum lines in the Summer & all sorts of exposed rubber and all that. If I go through with the purchase I‚Äôll be here a lot probably. If not I appreciate the help! I‚Äôd look for a more expensive one but I‚Äôm just trying to find a budget car that won‚Äôt take a couple grand to fix.",Isuzu
"My first ball joint was after by first brake job. Expect a similar experience learning. Parts are cheap, mechanics aren't.",Isuzu
"I've got a petrol and diesel Trooper, tho admittedly my petrol is the utterly gutless G200. Diesel goes so damn hard though, it's not quick but it drives awesome, and gets absurbly good milage. I'm somewhere between 9 and 10.5 L/100km, or around 26 to 22 mpg. My example isn't tuned either, I've heard good things about properly tuned examples doing even better.",Isuzu
True eye catching look still outstands between gray crowd.,Isuzu
"I know they're japanese, but I couldn't remember exactly what they'd done with the Vehicross. For some reason I had an idea in my head that it may have been export only.",Isuzu
Thank you for the advice! I really appreciate the responses,Isuzu
I live in Delta Junction. Hardly ever drive it to Fairbanks only bc of the short wheelbase and the hwy otw there. Lots of road work and weird deep dips. Plus everyone going 80+ and driving like idiots hah. So cool to know there‚Äôs one in Fairbanks! I‚Äôve never seen one up here. So there‚Äôs 2 where you live? Yours and the other? I love these damn things.,Isuzu
I have used this type of procedure before in this same kind of situation. Sometimes a full turn it off / turn it back works like a charm.,Isuzu
Parts might be hard to come by. Say a new clutch. But GM partnered with Isuzu so there's a chance for parts. They should gift it to you. Ha,Isuzu
"My 4l30e just died last week, much sad. It slips in 2nd and then goes to failsafe. No warning lights though which I find odd. It had 150k miles on it..",Isuzu
"It depends on how hard I am running, the weight I am running, and what sized tires. in the most stock, lightweight configuration I can get 20-23 mpg. In my heaviest / big tire configuration like 10 mpg.",Isuzu
"Lots of people towing 2t+ caravans around Australia with them with no problems at all.

Thank you for the video,Isuzu
Never did. Seller seemed odd over DM. Couldn‚Äôt answer mileage or anything else that would be seemingly important.,Isuzu
Seeing the dash was made fall in love with the car along with it's wedge shape,Isuzu
"You should be able to sell it for that no problem. If you post on Facebook,  I bet someone from planetisuzoo will cross link it. Everyone is interested in a 5-speed for a manual swap. It's always suggested that people doing swaps have the entire donor vehicle, so this would be perfect. Best of luck.",Isuzu
Nothing car related there. What color is yours? Any photos?,Isuzu
"Is it a bad idea? Yes.

Should I not? Yes.

Will it be a pain? Yes.

Do I want to? Yes.

I've come to you guys for advice. Will this be in any way reliable and sufficient for a daily driver in Utah? Will I be laughed out of shops when I meander on in for maintenance? I don't mind wrenching on it if I have to, but coming from a Lexus, I haven't really had to do much of that anyways. I know Isuzu has a great reputation for reliability, so that eases it up in my mind. Any input is highly appreciated.",Isuzu
"I found it, yeah. There's not enough details in the listing about the rebuild to justify the mileage and price. It is pretty, and in nearly perfect condition though, if only it had a manual transmission. 

&#x200B;

"U-joints? Shocks? Bushings? American here, I'm totally unfamiliar, but i wish we had those here.",Isuzu
"Thanks for the tips. So far I‚Äôve noticed there is a new fuel pump and filter but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the right one‚Ä¶.they cut the bed to get at it as I‚Äôve seen done before. Cleaned mass flow sensor, having trouble with vacuum lines. I have a Hanes but kinda lost. 

Updates on issues. Seems to only happen as I shift. Idle jumps around after the issue and a quick key cycle still fixes the issue. Sometimes I can rev really hard and clear it out, almost always have to cycle the key. Even if I put it in neutral and give the throttle a few taps and level it out once I shift it losses it agian UNLESS I cycle the keys. 1st is okay. 2ent is usually good. 3rd I can rev REAL high and get it about 50% of the time.

Will try the jumper fuel relay and continue to address vacuum

New question: is it bad to leave it off?,Isuzu
"rockauto.com, eBay, and then you need to go on Facebook and join the IsuZone group. You'll also want to source a repair manual. Also, a lot of parts are interchangeable with and from the Geo Storm and the As√ºna Sunfire, which are basically the same car.

Also, these have what's called passive rear wheel steering, and the suspension is tuned by Lotus, so get underneath it if you can and really check out the condition of the suspension and steering. Look for anything that looks bent or broken; those parts are some of the hardest to get or fix.",Isuzu

"It's less about lifespan and more about neglect. See, manufacturer(GM - Strasbourg, France) specs state that it should be serviced every 20,000 miles. This is a transmission that, in its previous format as a 3 speed, only ever backed a small car with less than 100 lb-ft of torque and weighed roughly 2300 lbs. To be more specific, the Chevette in the US.  The V6's in these trucks produce far more than that, and the vehicle weigh almost twice as much.   


If the transmission has been serviced a little regularly, it'll last. If it hadn't, they can end anywhere between now and 160k miles. That's about the highest I've seen an unmaintained transmission go. Someone else may have seen higher.   


All of that aside, the Rodeo platform is pretty damn solid. I have an 02 Axiom XS which is based on the Rodeo frame. I love it.",Isuzu
Its blue. Even got the original soft top. However its so rotten i may not be able to repair it.,Isuzu
Can you share the listing?,Isuzu
Yes he is. And I don't know if one that's busted yet!,Isuzu
"This one is pretty awesome. It was left in a field for 25 years. Only has 43,000 original miles. The seat and dashboard were destroyed from sun, the fuel with some of the worst lacquer I've ever seen, the carburetor was frozen inside because of it, fuel pump and filter had to be replaced, and the main battery cables, but it's almost done. 

New seat, deep clean, lots of tinkering, but worth it.
It's my son's first vehicle. He just got his permit.",Isuzu

"Any codes on the BCM or anti theft? Check the doors. I'm not super familiar with those systems, but any loose doors or door switches could set it off. Try arming it and shaking doors. I've definitely dealt with door latch issues on those in the past with amigos, rodeos, and passports.",Isuzu

"When I brought the ute, it had an injector tick when cold. I replaced all 4 injectors, and the tick went away. 35,000 km later it blew up. I was driving home from work when there was a loud metallic grinding nosie from the motor it lost power and started missing on one cylinder. This caused a huge oily mess under the bonnet.

They are so nice to look at!,Isuzu
I‚Äôll ask around. Is there a reason you won‚Äôt touch em if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?,Isuzu
"Hard to tell how many were made and/or were imported from a quick Google search. Kinda odd usually the numbers are on wiki or motor trend or something. What I found reading was they imported 50,000 one year so working off that little number if they imported 50k a year for 5 years looking at roughly a quarter million, but if they doubled or tripled imports a few years easily 500k to 1,000,000 would make sense. Now, random guess but i assume  probably half were automatic. So probably anywhere from the low of 100,000 and I would say the high probably 500,000 manuals 98-02 in the US... I read that they imported approximately 330,000 from 84-91. So I highly doubt they made more then 1 or 2 million between 98-02 unless they seriously ramped up production and imports which is completely possible but I don't think so.  Side note I don't know anything other then what I googled  and read for like 15 mins.",Isuzu

"Thanks!! I can only highly recommend this size turbo on yours, night and day and plenty of boost. It made 10 psi on stock fuel",Isuzu
"Excellent!! Mine definitely has a few electrical gremlins, but nothing too crazy... Those little DOHC motors seem to be fairly reliable; see how she idles. Check under that dash mat too, and see how the dash looks. 99% of them are destroyed lol.",Isuzu
I second this,Isuzu
It come with that washing machine too?!,Isuzu
Most exhaust shops will weld you up a simple muffler setup for a few hundred. It is a super simple / short muffler. If tomorrow you look at and have any additional questions don't hesitate to hit me up. This is the one isuzu I am a specialist on (98-02 amigo / rodeo sport),Isuzu
Thank you. I'll do that.,Isuzu

"You can probably purchase and replace the entire housing, BUT, uh... what vehicle and engine are we talking about here?? ü§£",Isuzu
"I bought one without really knowing how rare they were. But then I would occasionally come across them in the junk yard or see others for sale. I wouldn't count on finding one in a junk yard, but it happens.

Love mine too. The heater gets ridiculously hot to the point where I have to turn it down and crack the window in the winter. What tires are you running?,Isuzu
"Regarding your abs concerns u can open up the abs control module and see if you have a broken solder point. Mine had like 8 abs codes, split mine open and found 1 broken solder point. Soldered it back and she‚Äôs good as new. No more codes",Isuzu
"There are 2 different components to look at. 1st is the linkage from inside the cab to the transfer case. You should be able to pretty easily check for binding here. The 2nd is inside the transfer case itself, and for that you may have to disconnect driveshafts and pop a cover off.",Isuzu
"No tinkering with my Vehicross alarm. It just died one year, or maybe it was the clicker that died. New batteries didn't help. I can't recall. I just left it alone. Old school style, I use the actual key to manually lock and unlock the doors. It's long been a second car and no worries of breaking into or getting stolen here in the Central Texas backwoods. Ha",Isuzu
"It's hard to price a car that not many exist anymore. Try to bargain a little, you have to ask yourself if you are buying to resale or keep long term. If you have the money and don't mind spending it and will be happy then do it. 
I bought a 94' amigo to fix up and enjoy. I don't think I'll get my money back from what I put in it but I have enjoyed driving it. 
All used cars are pricey now a days and that's just how the market is.",Isuzu
"Vehicross's are pretty awesome. Basically the same chassis as the Amigo with upgraded front suspension (adjustable shocks) and a slightly larger engine (3.5 instead of 3.2). 

You can find an ""okay"" one for around 6k, a mint one for 12k, and the top tier ones are selling for upwards of 20. 

Known problems:
 Original shocks can be rebuilt by specialists but you cant buy replacements that are OEM. There are however some great aftermarket allternatives. 

Known problems:
Some of the plastics like to break and are hard to find
window motors like to go
auto trans only, there is a manual swap (look up ar5 swap)
Auto trans likes to go, but there is a rebuilder that bulletproofs them
The aftermarket scene is dead. Great however for if you like to fabricate! there are some incomplete kits out there, but you won't be able to 100% with any one manufacturer.",Isuzu
"Carburetor or fuel injected first off? If it is fuel injected there should be no reason to pump the gas pedal at all. 

With the high idle and hard start... sounds to me like you have a Carburetor that could use a cleaning, and maybe idle needs adjusting. I have an FI truck, so look for others for information there... but hopefully a starting point.",Isuzu

"As far as I know, the pickup is the USA model name of what everyone else calls the Rodeo

The USA Rodeo is called the MU internationally",Isuzu
"To clarify on the system malfunction you are observing, you turn the key and only dash lights come on, starter does not get engaged?

Is this an automatic or manual? If manual check to see if clutch switch on pedal is working right. 

Check to make sure all electrical connections to the starter / solenoid are tight. 

Does it repeat not working for any amount of time? Like if you try 2 or 3 times it works, or immediately on the second try? 

 Any observations on what you do when it starts working that might make a replicable scenario? Like if I don't jiggle the key it has problems, but if I do it immediately starts. Indicating a key cylinder issue.",Isuzu
Rare how so? every part you'd need is readily available and really not hard to find. The older pups are hard to find parts for but the pickups and SUV siblings are perhaps one of the most common light trucks ever made across the globe.

I purchased this new in 91 from Century Isuzu in Tampa. The dealer made a bunch of modifications and that candy stripe paint job to use as a showpiece. I originally purchased it to bring my eldest son home from the hospital then when he turned 16 I gave it to him. He died in the motorcycle accident and it sat in the yard for 11 years. My youngest son asked if we could fix it back up and he donated the proceeds of his car that he sold to do that and it's his truck now!,Isuzu

Huh interesting. My 2001 VX's alarm is still going strong.  Was there aftermarket tinkering maybe?,Isuzu
"i dont believe these have an exhaust brake, you may be thinking of the high idle feature that idles the engine up if your using a liftgate? in any case, the best manual is always the factory service manual.  they are pricey but worth it. i have an 01 gas npr and actually its easier to find info on the diesel.

https://www.ebay.com/itm/256335747498?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=GWQ2mzl2Tzi&sssrc=4429486&ssuid=VAh9RPwTQSa&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY

i dont think ive seen an exhaust brake on that small of a diesel  but who knows. the npr non hd is basically equivelent to a one ton truck, even though its considered a medium duty truck. mine has an 11,050 gvwr and my f350 has an 11,000 gvwr, the isuzu actually has smaller tires. 

im on an npr adventure too, although with a gas one, feel free to pm me if you want",Isuzu
"Yup, contacts look solid. Looks like your advice worked! Nicely done.",Isuzu
Some google fu reveals I'm probably wrong. Of course engineers thought of the drag!,Isuzu
"There are a few different ratings:

 - how much you can load it where your suspension works

 - how much you can load it to where it sits on the bump stops

 - how much you can load it to where the tires are at risk of popping and transmission going pop. 

If you have new shocks you are closer to the original load rating. If it is oem equipment, half the rating is probably about right.",Isuzu
"There is a guy in Europe who did one Slovakia? I think. There was build videos on YouTube at one point. It was pretty modern (not lead acid battery) based on a leaf or Tesla based. Was a good job. There are kits available plug and play but are pricey ¬£25k gbp. You can find the bits yourself cheaper but you need to know what you are doing spec wise. If you can buy the properly speced components its easier than a non narive emgine transplant. Yiu will have to invest in the appropriate tools (hydraulic crimps etc)  and software. I think it will become more and more common, prices will come down as demand for damaged ones wanes next to availability. Every damsged/salvaged Tesla is wanted for conversion and battery rebuilds at the moment but that will eventually due down. I have an Audi S8 which I want to do. Its all aluminium so won't rust away.",Isuzu

It‚Äôs not a terrible car at all, but the automatic transmissions will go out on you‚Ä¶owned a stick and loved it up to 220,000 and I would buy it again as a cheap 4wd suv‚Ä¶fun Honda collab.

"Damn, thats beautiful:)",Isuzu
MUA5 v6 trans?,Isuzu
"Sounds like the truck turns over but fuel isn't getting to it. Remember engines are pretty simple: Fuel, fire, air, compression.

 It sounds like you have fire, but a simple test is to pull the spark plug and with the plug wire attached touch it to the block to complete the circuit. Crank it and see if you see a spark in the plug. 

Next is air, which can also be compression. Get a compression testing tool and with each plug out see what compression you get. Looking at 60-90 psi per cylinder. I had a recent engine failure I diagnosed where 2 cylinders had no compression. You can rent this tool easily, or they're cheap on Amazon. If you get good compression per cylinder then you are good there. 

Last is fuel. Another tool is a fuel pressure gauge, simple inline tool. Make sure you are building fuel pressure. 

One of those will show a problem, that gives you the thread to pull.",Isuzu
Alrighty thanks for the help I will check all of that out,Isuzu
He still has his collection of Sherps and Ripsaws.  The vehicross is just cool.,Isuzu
"Parts availability will be an issue over time, it is a 28 year old vehicle, looks good though! I wouldnt use it as a daily personally. Second car sure",Isuzu
"The clutch.
An older vehicle is going to need work done on the clutch eventually... where I live the parts are worth more than the vehicle is worth and it's not an easy job.  
Even if it's a simple replacement of the master and/or slave cylinder: those are located inside the bell housing for some reason.  

The ball joints on the upper control arms are not replaceable without also replacing the control arms themselves. 

Where the exhaust connects to the catalytic converter can burn out/rust and is located in such a way that it is difficult to fabricate a ""patch"". Replacement parts may not be available.

You can turn this Rodeo into a very good off road vehicle that still maintains good on road manners by installing Rodeo springs in the rear (2.5""-3"" lift) and dialing in the front torsion bars to match.  With this lift you should be able to put 32"" tires on it.

And then all you have to do is slowly fall in love with your Rodeo while it slowly falls apart with no OEM or aftermarket support for the tiny little things that go wrong. 

One day you will be recovering a $25 000 dollar vehicle or, maybe, you'll be going down a trail with confidence that other people with more expensive rigs would approach with trepidation.",Isuzu

I put a set of Kenda Klever KR601 on her a few years ago. I don't go pure mudding with her, but she goes everywhere I've taken her.

"So I'm guessing it's a 2.3 carbureted one, there are a few things to check I'm having a issue with mine right now where it won't idle unless I hold my foot barely on the gas pedal, if it's the 2.3 carbureted one it has a mechanical fuel pump on the passenger side of the motor it runs off a lobe on the crankshaft if you want to replace it you have to get piston #4 to TDC before taking it off to replace it because of the plunger on the fuel pump, there is a 12v electrical pump upgrade for it that I've been looking into but I don't really know if the guy before me did it because there's a hole cut in the floor of the rear of the truck, hope some of this info could help, there's also a fuel check valve somewhere that I've been trying to find",Isuzu

"Do you have the manual?  It should be in there.

I don't know about this particular light, but dash lights tend to be color coded.

Green is an indicator (lights are on, cruise control, etc)

Blue is also an indicator (high beams)

The yellow/orange is a ""this needs attention soon, but you can drive home"". (Oil change light, ABS system deactivated light, traction control off)

Red usually means ""do not drive this until this is resolved"" (oil pressure light, coolant temperature light, trans temp, etc)

"I own a 1990 XS, that I'm working on as a project car too. It isn't impossible to get parts, but it is VERY hard. I cannot stress this enough. It will consume you. You'll get very good at it, but it will never really get easier. The parts market for these things is almost nonexistent.

Some of the issues I've had are wiring (can be redone by a shop), rust (can you fabricate and weld custom rocker panels?) And suspension (good luck üíÄ). You will have to modify parts off of other cars. You will have to import parts from Japan. You're gonna hate your life.

But dammit these cars are cool and I'm in too deep now, hehe.",Isuzu
"If it was a manual, I‚Äôd be all over it for that price in that condition (although I‚Äôd probably push for $2k). It looks really nice.

Well on mine there is a pickup tube on the bottom of the fuel pump assembly that rests in the very bottom of the gas tank. It has a fine plastic sock filter over the tube with micro perforations. That is where my problem was. I ran it out of gas once and after that I had similar problems. I replaced the pump but bought a cheap one that had me reuse the old sock filter.,Isuzu

"2021 Isuzu NPR 6.6 gas here(I think we‚Äôre the only box truck guys here)

Anyway, I had a similar thing happen to a Ford box truck of mine years ago. It was an absolute nightmare to deal with, but I was reimbursed for everything. Assume the shop will reimburse you for EVERYTHING. It‚Äôs what they‚Äôre supposed to do. Like someone said, they‚Äôre insured for this. Save every receipt. Make sure you‚Äôre only communicating with the manager or owner going forward. Take notes for every conversation. 

Be annoying, but friendly, call them twice a day for updates on the truck. Remind them you‚Äôre a business just like they are. If they give it back to you and that engine doesn‚Äôt act as good or better than before, immediately take it back to them, don‚Äôt even call ahead. Go with the attitude that you *expect* them to be liable for everything, because they are. 

‚ÄúAsk‚Äù the manager about reimbursement. If you have any pushback, go higher up the chain and explain to him/her you really don‚Äôt want to involve your lawyer.

"Someone else will probably have better advice, I am no expert, but here's my experience with my 01 Trooper.

Drove it daily from 09 to 19, 93k mi to 208k mi. Transmission was kinda meh from the start and (unbeknownst to me) was pretty much constantly running hot. Was broke, ignored that, it finally failed. Loved the damn thing and overall spent $6k on rebuilt transmission, suspension stuff particularly the front end, new tires, transmission install and diagnosing what the installer fucked up. No regrets, although it was a fucking ordeal. Over the years, I replaced cv axles and had the starter rebuilt, those were my two other failures in that time period.

I beat the shit out of this thing in the mountains and the maintenance schedule was fair at best. I am trying to take better care of it and use it for mountain excursions or driving the dogs around, definitely not my daily as it is at 211k mi now and I want it to last. The TOD check light has started to randomly flash, so I may be entering a new nightmare, but hopefully it's nothing big that I can't figure out myself. 

I've only been stuck in snow twice and never in mud, but I'm really not that adventurous. Hit a small deer at 50 mph earlier this year, only cosmetic damage. Gotta replace the grill and bumper and looking at sturdy options (limited for me, probably more limited for the Amigo). 

Very fun to do donuts in. 

Depending on the mileage, that could be a real fun ride. It could be reliable as a daily. It could also be a giant headache if something goes awry and you don't have a knowledgeable shop lined up. There are a lot of things to consider. I'd be really tempted to buy it too.",Isuzu

"The 4l30e is a disappointing transmission, BUT I've seen plenty on high mileage vehicles IF they're properly maintained.

"I browse the market constantly for Isuzu Impules, I-Marks, & Stylus‚Äôs so I see my fair share of these cars all around the country. This is a clean example that are so rare to find so that alone is worth it since you won‚Äôt really find them like this outside a ridiculous asking price from a dealership. Like a lot has said on here, it really depends what you‚Äôre looking to get out of this car. A track toy? Eh, there‚Äôs better bang for your buck cars out there. A daily driver? It‚Äôs doable but not ideal. A nifty cars & coffee conversation piece? This is will scratch that itch.",Isuzu

"Just recent picked this truck up for a good deal but the previous owner ripped off a bunch of parts. It‚Äôs been hard trying to piece this thing together without diagrams.

"thank you, i‚Äôll try and post there soon. Is that forum relatively active?
issue is im completely clueless on working on this motor and diesels as a whole, if you asked me to send a pic of the fuel pump i couldn‚Äôt, where do i even begin looking. My truck should be about 6500lbs dry weight with the stock 5.4, let‚Äôs say add an additional 300 for the new motor weight and we‚Äôre at 6800-6900. Thats hefty but not hefty enough to bog down a box truck motor this bad. getting 30mpg rn leads me to believe it‚Äôs a fuel issue so that‚Äôs what i‚Äôll tackle first, if it turns out to be engine and drivetrain issues after then i‚Äôll tackle that",Isuzu
The fuel consumption required to be in high 3rd is pretty significant. Maybe it's starved for air or fuel a  second. New fuel filter and air filter may help.,Isuzu

"I'll have to look that guy up. It looks like a cross between a Trooper and an Astrovan. Is it an Isuzu product, or is it something else re-badged as Isuzu?",Isuzu
"There is nothing special about the muffler. You can buy any size/shape you want and just have it welded in. There are unique features in the exhaust, like the bottle neck just behind the Y-pipe, but it's nothing any muffler shop can't handle. The bottle neck was too help the car get to operating temp faster for emissions.",Isuzu
"Other drivers tbh. Almost was in a head on collision from someone passing me and they couldn‚Äôt see the truck in the oncoming lane bc of snow. He was going probably 70. Luckily I had enough room to move over a foot and slow down for him to cut me off and then I had to deal with white out going 50. Oncoming guy was flashing his lights to get the guy to see him. The only thing worse than getting in a bad wreck is getting in a bad wreck when it‚Äôs that cold and 4 or so feet of snow on each side  and it takes up to an hour for an ambulance or even a trooper. Only 2 troopers for 100 miles. No police in my town. 

Other than that I‚Äôd say coming down tenderfoot. Going downhill on ice can be a little nerve racking but it went fine.",Isuzu
"Manual or automatic? Same questions as Kwiatkowski, more behavior. Does it never go above 3rd gear? 

Next question, how much mechanic experience do you have? Do you have the ability to check fuel pressure? Engines are fuel / fire / air. If it is choking out at heavy load when up to speed most likely fuel / air issues. Make sure you have a clean air filter and fuel filter.",Isuzu
Nice! What kind of lift do you have on it?,Isuzu
"The 3.2 DOHC (pre 98, first gen 3.2)is by far one of the most reliable engines that Isuzu ever made. Find a later trooper and swap in a AR5 manual transmission behind it and really wake it up.

"It is definitely worth it to keep driving it. I bought my 96 about 10 years ago. It is a 3.2L manual transmission. The check engine light has been on since I bought it due to the EGR, but luckily I live in an area where they don‚Äôt do emissions inspections, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about that for now. Changing the EGR out multiple times did nothing and I‚Äôm not really mechanically inclined, so I was unable to take advantage of any of the fixes that I found online such as bypassing the EGR.

It looks terrible, but nothing that cosmetic fixes couldn‚Äôt take care of. It looked great when I bought it, but of course, time takes its toll and things happen that you don‚Äôt always have the funds to fix. My front grill looks busted because I hit a deer a few years back. I would say the biggest struggles I have come across are that you need to keep good tires on it and keep it aligned because even if you have brand new tires, if they aren‚Äôt that great quality, in the rain, it will feel like you are piloting a boat.

Driver side door fell off at one point, lol. They were able to weld that back on. Every window motor has failed except for the front passenger side. Got the driver side fixed and didn‚Äôt worry about the back windows because no one ever rides back there. 

I am at 270,000 miles and it‚Äôs still going pretty good. I have no car payment and my insurance is less than $40 a month. Even as shitty as it looks and including the suspension work I‚Äôm going to be getting done soon on it, it is still way cheaper than anything you could get used now and I would rather keep driving something whose problems are known to me, than to drop money on something newer and shinier that may look a lot better, but could be riddled with even more expensive problems.",Isuzu
"Not going to be able to fix it, not worth it. I‚Äôll gladly take it off your handsüòÖ

in all seriousness: I‚Äôm not too familiar with these trucks but definitely check the linkage. Should be fairly easy to drop the transmission and transfer case together. 

I had a 97 Hardbody that had the same issue with linkage and all I did was pull the linkage off and grease the ‚Äúselector‚Äù piece on the side of the tcase and that did the trick. Good luck",Isuzu
"Some people had a little luck with sea foam, some with different oils, there were a LOT things that had been tried and are still being tried and even with case by case success, the overwhelming consensus is that the only way to actually fix is to fix the pistons. 

That being said, the best way is to change your oil regularly and ensure that the EGR is functioning correctly and it will take much longer for the problem to manifest itself. I have a couple Isuzu 3.5s with well over 100k that don‚Äôt burn oil‚Ä¶. Yet‚Ä¶",Isuzu

"So, I've got a 2003 Isuzu Rodeo - 2WD, 4 Cylinder.

While it has some issues (some of which I can troubleshoot) - I'm having some issues with one. Or perhaps I'm looking for a more complicated solution to an easy issue.

She runs very loud, as if the muffler were rusted through. However, the exterior of the muffler and the tailpipe look to be in decent condition. Yes, they have some rust, but it isn't flaking off and it hasn't caused rust holes (to my untrained eye) - though I know the internal parts of the muffler could be worn out.

While looking at the muffler, I noticed the parts in the pic looking very bad - kind of like I imagined the muffler was going to look. However, the muffler is on the passenger side, and this part is on the drivers side.

Any help identifying this rusty part would be appreciated... before heading to the shop with it (for some of her other issues) - I'm hoping to go in with an idea of what things are...

And forgot to say on the title - Thanks in advance!",Isuzu
"18 mpg if you're doing long road trips on the highway. 13-15 mpg if you're city driving. Also it will burn oil and you'll need to check the oil every other tank of gas. If you don't work on your own cars and use it as a second vehicle, then Isuzu is not for you.",Isuzu

My Story:
My First ‚Äúnew‚Äù vehicle I could afford to buy was a 1990 Isuzu SpaceCab pickup. Loved it so much!
So much fun to drive!!!
It was a 5 speed manual (and thats how I learned to drive stick). 

My baby never let me down.
Japanese Quality was very good.

I did many minor and sometimes major repairs myself. 
It was usually easy to fix, not like the complicated sh*t that made now.

Unfortunately as time went on, rust started to take over the body, thanks to living near the great lakes and salt used in the winter (really should of oil/rust coated more often, but I was young and dumb)

Time moves on ‚Ä¶
Got married, had multiple kids ‚Ä¶ had to let her goüò¢.

No luck finding one so far

"Other issue there is if your oil return holes in the pistons are clogged up, a thicker oil will make the oil consumption even worse unfortunately.  Now, if you can Seafoam the oil and get them cleaned out pretty good to where you aren't burning much anymore, maybe going to Rotella would keep them unclogged better since it has more detergents than most other oils.

Based on my 1998 V6 Rodeo that was burning a quart a tank, the Rotella just made things worse, but that was before I tried Seafoaming the thing.  It's getting better finally, so I'll likely try it again.

But yes, like others have said, pulling the pistons and drilling the current holes and making extra return holes is the only way to truly fix it.  Or getting aftermarket pistons that have the extra holes already there.

"We try to keep it active here, however the forum (planetisuzu) and the facebook groups (isuzu trader, lots of others) are where the real activity is at. 

That being said it sounds like that person has been tinkering really hard trying to find a problem that might be internal. 

Something to know is the automatic transmissions are a little fragile. If it is a manual transmission one, grab and run as those are worth their weight in gold (ar5 transmission in those I believe, mua5 in everything else). 

Frame issues happen specifically around the lower trailer arms in the rear, check for frame rust there. 

Accept oil burning is going to be a thing. Like a quart every thousand miles. Just what these engines do, so accept part of their maintenance is dealing with the after-effects of that (like another user said with clogged pcv and egr valves). 

If you want something you can tinker with but that is good out of the box, look in the 4-6k range of troopers. Lots of great condition ones in that price-range that you don't have to chase anything to start playing, you can get right to it.

"You took it for a flush and the dork at the shop left a big ol air bubble in your coolant loop somewhere. (This happens when you do a drain and flush or fill, and don't bother to burp the system)
 
Here is how I usually solve this. (there are other methods similar to this, check youtube.)
 
Take out the thermostat and re-install the housing so you run the whole coolant loop wide open (you don't need to turn the heater on, the heater rad is gonna flow coolant regardless of the fan blowing air across it or not). Park the rig somewhere on a hill nose uphill, parking brake, chock the wheels, then check the fluid levels in the radiator. if it seems low, add some. you want it right up to the neck (just shy of the weep hole to the overflow/reserve tank)
 
 
Now leave the cap off, jack the front of the vehicle up in the air by a couple feet so its really upward.. and then start the engine. Let it circulate for a while, temp does not matter, flow does. That's why we took the thermostat out and tipped the nose up so the riadiator is 'high' and the back of the engine is 'low'..Filler up! Sometimes you have to grope and 'pump' the lower or upper rad hose some to shove the fluids around (turn the engine off for this part), but only do this with the cap ON, not off.
 

Did the rad level drop? good! You burped some air out (you can often hear it happen too, most satisfying). top up on coolant again, and do it all over again.
  

Various methods will work, but I have found a combination of this, no thermostat, and cap-on rad-line groping (use two hands like you were manually pumping the system, gotta be kinda rough with it, works best with warm hoses) can help force an air bubble out of the system.
  

You want to be continually checking the radiator level and adding more cooland as needed.. and once it seems like you are sure you got it all.. put the rig back down and fill the reserve tank for coolant to the reccomended level, and put the thermostat back in. (its okay of you spill a little at this part, the reserve will make up for it later.)
 
 
Good luck!",Isuzu

The only weird mod even remotely close is that self-driving one from one of the 00s DARPA challenges, but I think that was just computers controlling the standard throttle and combustion stuff. Hard to find any electrified Isuzus that aren't new prototypes outside the US, really. 

My engine's ability to burn oil and eat gasoline has been the only real reason I've considered selling mine, which I would hate to do. If someone could electrify it I'd drive that thing till I died!",Isuzu

There are several recorded instances of owners using shell rotella 15w40 too effectively stop the oil consumption issues. I wouldn‚Äôt use anything except rotella 5w40 or 15w40. A catch can would also be a great mod to watch your consumption and prevent blow by. Also cleaning out the egr hose and valve can help as well,Isuzu

"From a non-isuzu source but might be worth a shot if your alarm won't shut off.

The security alarm system was tripped and caused the computer to lock out the ignition system. Remove the battery cables (both) for 13 minutes. While the cables are off, operate all the components in the vehicle with the key in the on position. Even though there is no power, this will drain all of the power to the vehicle completely. Then turn off the key and remove the key. Hook up the battery cables and put the key in the driver door and lock and unlock the door 3 times. Then open the door and see if the engine will start up.

As far as the repair, I‚Äôm only knowledgeable about the 3.5 in later years but just a basic tune up is my suggestion being plugs, coils, oil change, air filter, fuel filter, fresh gas. New PCV valve. Clean the MAF sensor. Not sure if they have an egr valve but that‚Äôs a common issue with the 3.5- cleaning the egr tube and the valve.",Isuzu

"Replace your suspension components, it‚Äôs not hard. First time I did it the passenger side took me 2 hours, drivers side took me 30 minutes because I learned. Don‚Äôt know much about trooper suspension but I assume it‚Äôs roughly the same as a rodeos. Balljoints, tie rods. Try and put your tie rod ends on as close as possible to the original ones were, a paint marker will help by marking where the threads end into the TRE. While you‚Äôre in there you can grease the hubs. Definitely inspect a lot. After everything is all said and done, definitely look into an alignment shop, because you could be out of alignment. 

As for the speedo, order a speed sensor off rock auto. If you have an automatic the speed sensor will be in the back of the transfer case (it was in my case) and threads right out. 5 minute job if it‚Äôs not seized in. Good luck. Check out the Isuzu trader group on FB or the planet Isuzu forum for more live information.",Isuzu

"Not in the slightest. If you live in an area that gets as low as -30 Celsius then 5w30 is ideal. You‚Äôll want an oil like the rotella 5w40 or 15w40. These are primarily diesel engine oils but they are the most effective for oil consumption on Subarus, euros, and isuzus I wouldn‚Äôt use anything else. A catch can is a closed system with two hoses and a metal can that attaches to your pcv valve then back to your intake. You will need someone who‚Äôs comfortable modifying vehicles to do it for you, relatively straightforward 30 minute job and it basically catches any oil thats would otherwise be burned if the can wasn‚Äôt there.

Actually, the front wheel hubs are so tiny the front wheel bearings are its weakest point, especially on this trim level with bigger 225/70R15 wheels, that‚Äôs why we always regularly have the front bearings repacked. 

Some owners retrofit 6-stud front hubs and rear differential with bigger bearings from the Crosswind/TFR with little to no modifications.",Isuzu
"If you are moving to a higher cost of living area then take advantage and buy in your cheaper area before you move, and sell once your in the higher COL area.  That's ideal, if financially possible. It's also probably best to sell to a private party vs trade-in, assuming you'd finance a new car. 

Never driven through CO but I've heard there's some like, mountains?  Solid brakes, suspension and steering are probably preferable in such regions. No? 

Ironically I have a friend who sold all his toys and drove his rodeo to live in WA.. It's in pretty mint condition though, with a ton of professional work, and he doesn't really need to work anymore (inheritance).

ETA: personally, I'd go anything awd in the Honda/Acura or Toyota/Lexus/(Scion?) SUV or crossover realm. Look up which gens have cvt transmission issues.  Subaru is popular but as someone who tends to work on my own stuff I don't love their boxer style engines and the drivetrain/trans on some are nightmares. Lexus were also dropping below Toyota fan boi values on certain chassis that are just rebadged.

I tinted the windows, added some dodge charger stock wheels with low pro tires, and lowered it about 2 inches. I would constantly be asked if I would sell it.

Wit bakkie met tralies was gemap gewees en ek het hom getrap. Het so om en by 10km/l gekry gemiddeld. Anders as ek rerig trap het ek so 9.5km/l gekry.

Nuutste 2.5 kry ek so 10.7km/l en dit sluit stad en oop pad in. Ek het Desember Krugerwildtuin toe gery en kon 12.2km/l kry met haar vol gelaai. Maar dit was teen 110km/h.

Overall dink ek nie ek kan juis kla oor die verbruik nie",Isuzu
