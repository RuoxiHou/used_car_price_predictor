I see them come in to my Lexus dealer quite often.,Lexus
Keep the plastic clean for when it's time to sell lmao,Lexus
"Yeah thats basically how every good car becomes rare and expensive, teens get ahold of them when they’re everywhere and cheap, they become trashed and junked, scrapped totaled etc and I think thats how the LS400 might become.",Lexus
I was bamboozled when i found out my brothers 08 Ls460L had self parking 😂,Lexus

"Congrats, what color is this? Is it new?",Lexus
"Thank you! That’s exactly what I do now, I bring my new type s Acura to the Honda dealer and the repair prices don’t even compare. I wish I could stress that point to everyone on this earth.",Lexus
"From gas saver to gas eater. That is one hell of an upgrade, mate. Congrats!",Lexus
"Black plastic doesn’t stop noise and just traps dust and grit in the engine bay. Solely for looks. Gray intake manifold cover may dampen some vibrations as it has a thick foam backing. I threw away my black plastic, kept the grey.",Lexus
i hate it but if i take it off someone’s gonna break it so I leave it on,Lexus
"Not too bad though, those repairs are a one and done type of deal and if you’re doing it diy it’s not nearly as expensive. When comparing to any other competitor the LS is dirt cheap to repair",Lexus
U can see the car right? That’s the point.,Lexus
"Exactly, but dealership and mechanics are crooks 😂",Lexus
It doesn’t matter what the number is - the real question you need to be asking is -If you turn the volume all the way up how soon will I be replacing the Cheap ML speakers. Just because you paid $2500 extra does not mean they aren’t inexpensive paper woofers.,Lexus
"After 4 Hyundais…no more for us.  Everything is a fight to get done, both with the dealer and the manufacturer…too many to elaborate, but we had an ‘check engine’ light come on…and we were told it may take a month or more for them to look at it, so we called Hyundai corporate for approval for a loner (all work was warranty)…must leave a voicemail with the request…it took 10 DAYS to get a return call…other issues as well, but we purchased a Lexus rx350, after getting rid of the Santa Fe which had only 19,000 miles…no more Hyundai’s will be had in our household.",Lexus
"I ended up calling my dealer and asking and they were like “oh yeah, they’re available to order. Would you like me to?” and a week later I had my second fob.",Lexus
Love the name! It does look like a jeep from the rear 100%. But nice car,Lexus
"I’ve driven both and for some reason 21 and later IS 350s feel slower to me than a base model Corolla bordering on old Prius.

The ES on the hand definitely feels more boaty on the actual drive but feels like the pick up faster like my 8 year old rx.",Lexus
"I have the same wheels, but mine doesn’t have the luxury package. One owner car so I’m not sure if the wheels could be optioned when new without the luxury package?",Lexus
"I would doubt it, it is like 250 lbs heavier. But it’s 50 more hp, and slightly better aero. Even if it wasn’t though, you would have to be insane to pick an ISF over an RCF for a daily driver.",Lexus
"Its not cheap, it's atleast couple of hundred to refinish each rim.",Lexus
Thats the going rate..,Lexus
"Black door handles are just covers and you can find them on eBay. They fit the es and is and NX as well I believe. 

Visors are in channel by team heko, also on ebay. I don’t like stick on visors so I was pretty particular. I believe I’m the first UX to run these as well. Make sure you use the metal clips for the rear ones otherwise over time they’ll fall out (if you crack the windows more than a little) due to adhesive not being the best. 

My favorite aesthetic on my UX is probably my Aimgain kit. Fun little daily for what it is.",Lexus
odometer & price pls,Lexus
What'd you trade it for,Lexus
Do want but not enough to pay that price but someone will I'm sure.  My GS460 will do until I win the lotto.,Lexus
"I didn’t think you were saying that , I just took it as my husband can’t drive lol.",Lexus
"The 2018+ ES series would like to have a word with you, good sir. Something about the Avalon platform…",Lexus
Agreed,Lexus

"I have a 2023 ES 350 and have driven the 2023 IS 350 on a few occasions as a loaner. Here are my subjective, ""non-car guy"" impressions:

&#x200B;

* The IS is certainly more fun to drive and zippier around town and around the corners. The ES is more regal and disconnected in its handling--although far from mushy.
* The IS seems faster on surface streets, however, on the highway at speed, my ES actually seems subjectively a bit quicker to accelerate. (I am not sure the IS is quicker--is it? Someone at the dealer told me that the IS is actually heaver than the ES. Is this true?)
* Although the IS is fun, I began to tire a bit of the extra noise vs the ES. This would likely begin to bug me on road trips (which my wife and I take 3-4 times a year), as I have sensitive hearing
* With the IS, I begin to miss some of the features on my ES, like my seat automatically sliding back when I shut off the car.
* The ES is significantly roomier, another plus on road trips (we take a lot of stuff and come back with lots of books, records, wine, etc.)
* The AC on the IS seems much more powerful. If you like a blast of icy air in the face, the IS will satisfy! The ES climate control certainly does the trick, but seems a bit slower, and is more about maintaining a certain temp rather than blasting you with AC or heat.
* If I were to buy an IS, I would definitely get the F-Sport with the **RED** interior. Love it!

&#x200B;

Don't think you can go wrong with either, but you should certainly test drive first and consider what your priories are.",Lexus
It’s definitely not a brand that will ever be on my radar again which is sad because I quite like the looks of the Genesis G70 and GV70 especially in the matte grey colors. The dealership experience is also piss poor in my experience. When I purchased the Kia it was a super pushy and overall negative experience and my credit is super prime when my credit was pulled it was 796 and they told my “credit is really not that great” and they wouldn’t use my already arranged financing they said it must be through them turns out it was because they won’t get the kickbacks if they don’t do the financing through them.,Lexus
I owned mine fir about 5 years and I thought it was a pine example of a car.,Lexus
"I cracked the glass on mine.. The replacement cost was expensive because of the heating, dimming and curved mirror surface.

I ended up getting a used one and cleaning it up for far less",Lexus

u think so? all the LC in my area stay on the lot for a max of a week,Lexus

This exact white and blue LC500 is my dream car,Lexus
"If you spent 35k, all at shops,  on an actually old Lexus it would be even more reliable, look cool, and smoke anything for half the price. Ls400. Sc400. Soarer. Crown. Anything with old 1uz. Reliable daily power up to like 600 and then it’s that race car territory and expense.",Lexus
"Luxury cars look to push the envelope with tech and drive trains with redesigns. There's almost always issues with the first Gen on any vehicle, lux vehicles especially. So year 1 they're getting into, year 2 they have fixes and by year 3 you know those initial problems are set and you have a good Idea on any recalls that are in market.

So unless it's a lease. I won't buy any lux car in the first 3 years. Now if it's a lease that doesn't matter as much since it's a rental anyway",Lexus
What car?,Lexus
"I did the same upgrade from my model 3, good choice!",Lexus

I traded in my 2013 Prius with 240k+ miles with the original battery so I’d say a very long time.,Lexus
My guy.  Even the cheapest cars aren't that cheap.  Maybe go price out parts for your car before you talk?,Lexus
Great question. Maybe I’ll pop into Toyota and look at the Grand Highlander in person. Thank you!,Lexus
Not bad - I paid about $60k CAD for a 2017 RCF with essentially the same mileage. I'd imagine the GSF to be more rare,Lexus

Don’t mind everyone’s opinion on your age. I was 21 when I bought my first home and Lexus Gs350. 24 now. Don’t regret putting myself in debt for a bit almost got the car paid off. but sometimes I regret not waiting for a great deal on an ISF. (Lexus v8),Lexus

"Will say this, seats in my RX500H and IS350 are more comfortable than the ones in my GLE. My GLE had just hit week 3 at the dealership for water intrusion issues.

"I'd like to add here, that the parts pricing seems reasonable, however they've doubled up on the labor. There is about 90% overlap in work between pads/rotors, and replacing calipers. Two hours labor total is more realistic, and it looks as though they've billed around 2 hours for each (not sure of the labor rate). ",Lexus

"Everything except handling and feel is better on the rcf. Subjective also bc I don’t like driving a tank that feels that heavy when turning on ramps at 40 but the trade off is it feels more solid over rougher roads. Whatever you prefer , imo the isf is much better on the track in every way. The couple of horses offset the extra weight ( if that) and 10k into an isf will be almost guaranteed be faster than putting 10k into an rcf.",Lexus

You have got to be either joking or a major troll. I owned both A5 and GS 350 ‘13MY and in its generation the GS was not only the better handling car but it was also the lightest in its class. Audis on the other hand are well known for their numb steering feel due to it being on a FWD architecture as opposed to RWD on the GS.,Lexus

What kind of ‘logic’ brought you to that conclusion?,Lexus
"Register on [My Lexus](https://www.lexus.com/My-Lexus) and plug in the vehicle VIN.  The site registration is free and will provide every service the vehicle has had performed if done at a Lexus or Toyota dealership.  As someone else pointed out, the hybrid battery is a big expense if it hasn’t been recently replaced. In addition, check to see if the ATF has been changed recently or at all. That’s an important maintenance item!

The mileage isn’t a big concern if the vehicle has been properly maintained. These RX’s will easily go 250-300K+.  One previous owner is a really good find. Be sure the vehicle wasn’t involved in any major accident repairs. Check CarFax along with the My Lexus maintenance history.  Spark plugs should have been replaced at around 120K.  Check when the coolant was last changed…should be every 50K based on the current mileage of that vehicle. 

Finally, as someone else suggested, have an independent mechanic inspect the vehicle before purchase. It’s worth a couple hundred bucks to give it a full inspection so no hidden or unexpected repairs are required short turn.  

Good luck. I hope it all checks out for you. These are great cars! Comfortable on long road trips…especially to the beach!",Lexus

One thing I learned with my experience is that understand who owns the dealership. In my area 1 corp owns Lexus dealerships named differently across 2 states so when I tried to shop around they knew I was negotiating with their other branches. I figured out underlying owners to target my emails and then asked for competitive quotes last three days of Jan. So know that you can still negotiate aggressively for luxury cars. I wanted hybrid but they didn’t have it in stock and I would not have a good negotiating position. I figured with almost 10-12k in upfront saving I can buy enough gas to last about 8 years.,Lexus

"No. That’s not true. That being said, like all manufacturers, certain models and years have problems. My ‘15 Genesis 5.0 had propeller shaft problems (fixed under warranty) as did others from this year. There was a year where the G90s suffered from vampiric drain of the battery that they couldn’t figure out (I think 2018 or 2019). My brother had that problem. Are they as reliable as an RX pre-2024 facelift? No. But they aren’t the pile of shit that these pepegas claim when they “LuLz KiA aNd HyuNdaI.” My Genesis was as close to my previously owned LS400 as you could get without buying a Lexus. I only sold it due to mobility issues making it hard for me to get up and out of. 

I wouldn’t hesitate to get a GV if it worked size wise for my needs, but if I drove a lot of miles every year and planned to keep it for a long time, I’d get the RX pre-2024 facelift (which has some bugs to work out along with the new TX).",Lexus

"I got it at around 80,000km almost exactly 2 years ago, and it is now at 134,000km.  In those 2 years, I've driven it clean across all of Canada's provinces, Pacific Ocean to Atlantic Ocean and back (once in the dead of winter and back in the middle of summer).  I've also driven it through Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Utah, New York, Vermont, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.   

Besides the one random tire pressure sensor thing dying, I've had absolutely zero issues.",Lexus

"OP IS-Fs are a Lexus but they are not cheap to maintain. Don’t let these scare you off, but here are some prices you can expect:

Gas, you will get 8-15 mpg driving it hard so you will be filling up on 91+ multiple times a week. It adds up quick (ask me how I know).

The car takes just under 10 quarts of oil which can add up.

Consumables add up quick when driven hard. Brake pads are $360 for just the front set, rotors are $160 a side, tires don’t last long at all. These will be changed every 10,000-15,000 miles.

Suspension components will wear quicker than other cars and it’s also not cheap.

Try to find an IS-F with the coolant valley plate resealed. If not you will likely have to do it for $1,000-$2000. When this happens it could brake 4 injectors at ~$420 a piece. Make sure the dashes have been replaced under the recall, you don’t want to foot that bill.

As long as you can comfortably afford this, pull the trigger, it’s an amazing car.

As others have noted get ready for an insane insurance quote :/


Use Lexus.com and input the ViN and check service history. Use a carfax site like vinwise.org and buy 10 reports so you can lookup any IS-F you’re interested in.

Don’t be afraid about 08-10 models, the suspension difference is blown out of proportion IMO. You don’t buy these cars to be comfortable on a long trip, you buy them to plant down and drive hard! If you don’t like the suspension then get aftermarket when the stock wears out.",Lexus
Lexus ls430 is peak Lexus. It’s such a baller car and seriously the best Lexus from the 90s-2006 era. I loved my landcruisers just as much but to drive on regular roads the 430 was king,Lexus

RX all day. Unless you have a Genesis exclusive dealer nearby then all of your dealer experience will be with Hyundai employees and that’s enough for me to never consider it.

"I absolutely love the car. When I first got it felt *too* nice for me, to be honest. Previously I drove a Mazda 6, and the LS is very obviously a few classes above the 6. Which is good, and bad in my opinion. I tend to worry a bit more than I should about what could go wrong, and there are a few things on the LS460 that could/will eventually go wrong. I purchased it with 116,000 miles on it and also purchased a warranty with it. Since purchasing it, the only real repairs that have been done (under warranty thankfully) are the high pressure fuel pump gaskets which were leaking, and the water pump which was just starting to seep. So that would be the “bad” from my experience so far. The good - there are a lot of aspects of this car that are so good it’s hard to justify selling simply due to what *could* go wrong. The ride is one of the best I’ve ever experienced. It’s so quiet with the music off and climate control off, even at highway speeds. You can whisper to someone in the car and they would hear you. The ML audio is by far the best I’ve ever heard in a car. As far as fuel mileage is concerned, it’s not great in the city (~16-18 mpg) but for highway miles, I average anywhere from 20-23 depending on speed and traffic. For a yacht, that’s mileage to write home about. 

tl;dr: I love the car, it’s almost too nice for me, and the potential repairs scare the hell out of me.",Lexus
yes ok,Lexus
"Something about it being a “visual nuisance” and “not matching the desired asthetic of the neighborhood”. Not agreeing with that at all, but that’s how they operate.

In my HOA, they threw a fit of me wanting to put up a small Arlo security camera and solar panel for it - not talking a huge solar panel on my roof, literally a solar panel the size of a large phone next to the camera on my front porch. Camera and panel were the color of the siding too, but they weren’t having it. It was that day I learned to ask for forgiveness rather than permissions when it comes to HOAs.",Lexus
Yup it went to a kid that was raised properly lol,Lexus
"Check this link out. I had the same issue after only having my new car for 5months. For me, going through the dealer gave me peace of mind knowing they use genuine parts and did install and calibrate there, not outsource.

What’s the mileage. Contemplating between GH or TX to replace 2017 RX,Lexus
"I’m not sure what the right term is, but when you open your door, there is a metal loop like object that grabs onto the door when you shut it. The TRD version adds a spring loaded mechanism to the metal loop, so when the door closes, the spring pushes against the door, which makes the door rigid.

Without the spring, the door is a bit hollow, but the spring stiffens up the door, since it’s putting pressure against the door. If you look up TRD door stabilizer on Google, TRD Japan posted some data which shows it increases chassis rigidity. I purchased mine from Lexus Boutique, which is a website with a bunch of TRD and Lexus Japan parts.

I haven’t looked into the sway bars, cause I believe they are only for the pre facelift IS and RC, but I could be wrong.",Lexus

I’d say you can reach 200k+ until you should start to save for a battery replacement. A replacement from an independent hybrid place is only 3-4K. It’s really easy to replace on Toyotas and Lexus since they’re all under the rear seat. Just pop the seats off and it’s easy to pull out. Don’t go to the dealer to get it replaced.,Lexus

I like the look myself. I like having a clean looking engine bay and the covers tend to be easier to clean in between more serious efforts. But I don't like the clips some use. My RX had a ton of clips. My NX along with my wife's car has a pull off cover that's much easier to deal with but more effort to keep the clean look with so much more exposed. On my wife's car the engine covers substantially keep a lot of dirt on sloppy days from settling on the engine.,Lexus
"Odd sound, it almost sounds like you’re putting it into gear immediately when it starts which obviously you aren’t.

Brought my ES350F in for its 5K maintenance, asked if i would like to try an suv or another sedan as a loaner, before being asked if i would like to have breakfast at their customer area. Had pancakes and bacon, then walked out to a newly washed rx350 as a weekend loaner (dealer has a carwash area for unlimited carwashes for its customers) while my car gets serviced over the weekend.  Not bragging here, its just hard to compare against the service I would get bringing in my camry to my toyota dealership.

Yes LS is a Lexus model all Genesis models start with G,Lexus
Nobody knows how long a gv70 is going to last. It could be 100k miles maybe 500k no one knows To new of a drivetrain. I can tell you the rx350 is a 300k mile vehicle and the chances of it having less issues is very high. The gv70 will be quicker and more modern on the inside. Doesn’t mean the quality of the interior is nicer just more modern which some prefer,Lexus
Whatever car that has the 1UZ (LS400),Lexus
RX for sure. Quality over cheap and unreliable.,Lexus

I first thought: ""Wow I parked like shit.""

Then realized that wasn't me.",Lexus
"Inquire about maintenance. These are older vehicles and need attention to keep them running properly. A huge one will be the timing belt/water pump (comes in a kit). If this hasn’t been changed *at all* in its lifespan it’ll need done asap. If this is something you can’t do yourself, you’ll need to pay for someone and that can be a pretty penny. If they have no record of maintenance, shoot a lower offer",Lexus
The LS is arguably their flagship vehicle -- they don't make a ton and don't send a lot of them to the US. It's also expensive (cheap compared to the competition though).,Lexus
15 es300h,Lexus
I’d personally do it from my trusted local mechanic & save big $$.,Lexus
Of course not…… no one is going to chop up a perfectly good for no reason unless they are nuts,Lexus
and keep engine a bit cleaner ?,Lexus
Clean ls bro🫡,Lexus
"Indeed, if you got money and time to burn, get the Genesis. 

Smart money goes to Lexus.",Lexus
Maybe consider a GS? Best of both worlds,Lexus
"I appreciate that a lot, you're the man. I currently have a low mileage Lexus CT200h so a bit of a mix of your ex and current. I can drive it for years to come. Who knows what will be possible after that...",Lexus
"sorry to hear that, but glad you're okay. rip your baby.",Lexus
"Nice!  When I got my UX serviced recently (which only took a couple hours), I got a NX.  The loaners were all lined up and they just gave me the first one in line.  I had kind of hoped for something more different than a UX, but didn't care enough to actually ask.  When I came back, the next one in line was an RZ, which I would have been interested to try.",Lexus
What is EOL?,Lexus
Avoid the Hyundai,Lexus
I swear by every 5k. Toyota dealer will do it for cheaper. But no loaner car and no fancy cafe :),Lexus
"All the people with lexus suvs here have a pillared driveway, wheel boots, or chains through the wheel to prevent theft.",Lexus
"Go to an independent shop and bring your own brake parts, I recommend to find some decent rotors off Amazon and get Akebono brake pads which are one of the best brake pads for these cars. That price at the dealer is insane",Lexus

Very nice!!,Lexus
I’ve been looking for around 2 years. Just takes patience,Lexus
have a nice day bro,Lexus
"I love all of the ES that I've had!!! I may be biased, but the damn car doesn't disappoint.

Plus, I think many of the models look a little sporty now with more curve.",Lexus
Congrats,Lexus
"Thanks. I have a full aimgain kit on the car, which includes the rear diffuser.",Lexus
🤣,Lexus
"If I remember, the og 2008 isf put up better track times than the rcf.  I was thinking the rcf may be even heavier.",Lexus
You are blessed and fortunate.  You control insurance,Lexus
Beep Beep! Big baller alert!!! Congrats on the new whip!!! 🎉🎊😊🔥,Lexus
"Why don’t you go with a Toyota instead? Low maintenance and no premium fuel. Get a hybrid. 

Fancy cars come with higher maintenance costs.  It’s not just a finance thing.

Your second car on the other hand…you probably won’t be asking us. You’d have earned it. At that point you’d probably already know what you want and know you can afford it.",Lexus
yeah 303,Lexus
Lucky. That’s excellent looking.,Lexus
"GV. Excellent rating and great to drive. Tech on point and the interior is gorgeous. Unless yer a granny and wanna wallow down the street, go Genesis.",Lexus

????,Lexus
"I’ll check that car out, should I get an older one to save more money?",Lexus
this thing is sick,Lexus
I had a 07 IS350 and the rear caliper seized on both sides while I had the car. Really annoying since the time I noticed it seized the brake rotors and pads are already worn down. And I can't just change one side of the pads and rotors. Really sucks,Lexus
I mean I don’t have any other expenses to pay besides maybe a few small bills such as Spotify and other monthly subscriptions,Lexus

"I’d post my car here, but I have a feeling people would get angry at me 😂",Lexus

"CEL and ""check hybrid system"", something of that nature will pop up in the dashboard.",Lexus
"Since 16, Im almost 19 now, always wanted the LS400, and my dad had a friend who was junking one, so my dad bought it from him for 650 and me and him drove it home and the love for LS400s has stuck ever since.",Lexus
Maybe a used IS 350 that just came off a lease?,Lexus
Bro. Obviously Lexus is the way to go.,Lexus
"Yes I dealt with this. I got both calipers for under $200 from Lexus a few years ago (before the crazy prices). They told me they sell a ton of them.

Was not a hard repair, but I spent like 3 hrs trying to free the old ones, heating, banging, waste of time. The big pin locked in. Now I re-grease every 2 years (Some brands actually put that in required service). Likely his rear calipers are shot. Probably better to buy new.",Lexus
Agree!,Lexus
Change at 5k. What model do you have and year?,Lexus
"Oh, maybe they changed the F Sport to F Sport Design to differentiate it from the IS500 F Sport performance. But it's basically the F Sport from before. It's a cosmetic package with the adaptive suspension the only real difference",Lexus
I love that the shifter is basically the same,Lexus
I don't think Lexus has ever partnered or worked with another car company. BYD made a copy of the Lexus RX called the BYD S6 but that wasn't approved by Toyota/Lexus.,Lexus
my dad has the ultimate set of tools,Lexus
"Sorry, man. I re-read what I typed earlier and it was rude and not adding to the conversation. I'm glad you love your car and are treating the GSF well since they're turning into unicorns.",Lexus
"Thanks, the Royal Jade Green is a nice solid color",Lexus
I’m curious if theyd offer this interior color for bespoke builds. Ik they got blue/white interior but this would be nice too even tho its just for limited inspiration series.,Lexus
Isn't that it's nicknamed Beauty Cover,Lexus

That's a tough one....🤔,Lexus
Only a few hundred were made,Lexus
There ya go! If that’s Wesley Chapel then I am sure it’s been sold.,Lexus
"Get the right tools and it only takes less than 1 hour if it's your first time. It's super easy on this car, just need to be careful. Recommend using a torque wrench as well (Google the spec for it, I don't remember).",Lexus
$34K after taxes? That's a solid deal. I am also looking at this model and it seemed to be around that price here in IL.,Lexus
I bought mine L/Certified in January 2020 for 24k.  It’s been paid off for 18 months and now has 140k miles.  I’m hoping to drive mine to 250k,Lexus
What year is your car? I’m thinking of moving out of an IS350 into a GS. I love how the IS handles but it would be nice to have more  room in the back seat.,Lexus
Hard,Lexus
"How much can you currently put down on a vehicle? Here is how I would think about it financially:

With let’s say 750 a week coming in, every month you make 3k. Let’s say half of that goes to expenses, and you want to put 1k a month away into savings, you can spare $500 a month on car expenses. But that’s gas / oil changes / maintenance (let’s say, $100), insurance (let’s say $150), and payment ($250 a month). 

What you can do is take your down payment (let’s say you have 5k saved up), plus 3 years of your payment amount ($250 x 36 months). This is 9k. So you should target a car purchase around 14k. If you talk to a lender or the financing manager or salesman at the dealership, they will encourage people, especially younger people, to look at 60 or 72 or 84 month loans - but this is a truly, awful idea. Ask to look at 36 month financing - this gets you a lower interest rate and is a really good compromise.

If you want, say, a 20k car, you have to think, what other expenditures am I willing to give up. Are you willing to give up concerts, vacation, eating out, etc, other fun things because you have a bigger payment?",Lexus
Hyundai/Genesis product is not going to be close in terms of long term reliability or quality.,Lexus
Can I have the rims?,Lexus
"I like good things but I’m cheap, can’t beat Toyo Extensa HP II for the price and performance.",Lexus
If you’re not really looking for performance acceleration it’s going to be the RX all day. Forgo the F sport models since the suspension is tuned for handling and not comfort. But holy fuck turn on the sport suspension and it feels fucking awesome.,Lexus
"Common in new vehicles to have some sort of “Attention Minder” that uses certain data points to determine if someone may be falling asleep at the wheel, such as drifting, weird acceleration/deceleration patterns, etc. I don’t really drive tired so I’ve never had them alert me on my vehicle, but this is my basic understanding of how they work.",Lexus
It’s called the driver assistance package with the eye detection hump thing over the steering colum.,Lexus
Most likely don’t need to retrain them if you buy OEM densos. I bought 5 from Amazon and replaced them when I got my new tires and they did everything at discount tire,Lexus
20 cents a gallon gas tax in Texas.  One of the lowest in the country.   Close to 60 in PA and you should see the highway projects.  Get what you pay for I guess.,Lexus
"Never bring your own parts to a trusted mechanic. 90% of the time the parts are wrong now you have to pay for more parts. Good luck returning those eBay rotors and pads at no cost. If I’m a trusted mechanic, let me do my job",Lexus
Quite the upgrade my friend. Congrats!,Lexus
"We all are prone to underestimating risks.  Especially when we're younger and have less experience.  And time pressures are coercing us to do so.

As we get older, and managed to make it through despite our actions, we tend to take less risks.

I'm speaking from six decades of driving experience.",Lexus
"The GS vs IS seems like a better comparison.  As an IS owner, the ES is a car that I wouldn’t really consider.  Like a rebadged Camry.  Unfortunately they stopped making the GS in 2020, I think.  Shame, it’s a GT sled and reminds me a lot of my e60.",Lexus
Right after refreshing it? Seems like odd timing.,Lexus

why ?",Lexus
Love the ISF too but it’s too small for my size,Lexus
oooof when can you detail my ‘95 Camry Wagon? shit looks amazing!,Lexus
"I'm fortunate to have a big garage (12 feet) but I've seen car lifts work in smaller. 

Granted, those situations only worked because the owners didn't have land yacht SUVs or pickup trucks parked in there.",Lexus

That’s pretty awesome….. wait till you start seeing Benz…. Lambo …. Bugatti etc lol,Lexus
Haha. Well at least you know the cause!,Lexus
"I like how it looks, it’s definitely annoying when you need to check something yourself in a pinch, but a bought a clip and tool kit on Amazon that came with 100 clips so any I lost I can always replace. I’ve had people say the engine bay looks nicer with the cover, and I agree. There’s nothing pretty about an engine bay in most cars imo. Usually speciality cars or built cars have nice engine bays you can admire, but this isn’t really one of those.",Lexus
Looks like a mini van,Lexus
"Thanks again for your help! Bummer I missed yours private sale, but glad I could avoid the dealership in the end",Lexus
"Thought I was the only one who preferred the aesthetics of ‘95-‘97 cars over the facelift. Glad to know I’m not the only one. 

Thanks for the input!",Lexus
Reading this makes me think I should sell my 2020 GS since it has low mileage.,Lexus
"Yes very lightly, then buffed it up again with a wax",Lexus
Luxury trim has the same! I believe the dampening rates are a bit less in Sport+ though. I’m not 100% on that though. Do you have Sport+ on your mode dial?,Lexus

Is the TX just their version of the Kluger (we don’t have it in Australia)?,Lexus
"Such a fun car loved that thing, only thing I regret is not going with a 11+ for the lsd, plus cooler cluster and heater suspension. The 09 was still amazing. The only thing I did to that car over 4 years was a water pump and oil changed and couple sets of tires",Lexus
"Power rear sunshade, cold weather package, rear seat audio/climate controls, power trunk, low profile spoiler, and the bigger wheels all were on mine. The beauty of getting from a couple in their 80’s that didn’t drive it much. Lol",Lexus

It's a super quiet and smooth cruiser.  The V6 is more powerful but the power is wasted due to the car's lack of dynamic ability.  I think this power train matches the car much better.  Quietest hybrid I've driven.  40+ miles per gallon!,Lexus

"They’re NiMh batteries with limited life. IMHO, Lexus does an excellent job of charging and draining at appropriate levels to get so many years out of them.

To all the people in the comments, I’m sorry I’ve got the money for one of my dream cars at 18 I guess. I’m trying to do good with the money by buying a rare car that is appreciating in value.

I like it for what the intended purposes are for. They’re not the hard to remove while servicing. Certainly keep the engine cover on. It has insulation on the backside for noise.,Lexus

"You’re posting this on a Lexus subreddit so the answer will be biased. The Genesis in my opinion is a better product on its own, but the dealership network can be super hit or miss.

Tempted to ask them to test drive one for fun when I’m in for service next…,Lexus
So what’s the drivetrain in the LC???,Lexus
The LS is significantly quieter and smoother on the highway. I regret listening to folks who suggested the ES was close. There are a lot of reasons to choose the ES but if ride quality and NVH are your top priority go LS.,Lexus
Then this would be a great purchase.  Congrats.  To answer your initial question about crapping out the !S 350 is pretty darn bullet proof with the normally aspirated engine.  You will probably get over 300K easily with oil changes every 5000 miles with synthetic even if the dealer says to change every 10000K.,Lexus

"I can’t provide any specific details on the difference for the years you asked about. I just traded my 2018 ES 350 for a 2021 ES 350 F. My 2021 only had 30k miles and came with upgraded ML sound system. I usually shop for low mileage cars to save on the depreciation. In my case, I saved over $20k buying a used vehicle that is in very good condition. The 2021 had a larger nav display with CarPlay that is very nice. It still has the bumper to bumper warranty to October 2025 or 50k miles.

"I got a mint used ES, but it’s purely for commuting. IMO the GS is a way different beast and a better vehicle in every way. I really do like my ES, but it’s nothing special. If you are just looking for a quiet highway cruiser the ES is very good in that role but it isn’t sporty in any way.",Lexus
I just looked it up on google and it says that if you’re having problems with an evap leak a stored code will shut off vsc. Check your fuel cap and make sure it’s secure and tight. Take it to autozone and see what the code is. Google made it sound like an evap leak or something small. And since you said that it’s running fine I’d assume the same thing.,Lexus

"I'm getting an average of 42, but my commute to work is mostly 50mph roads and some city driving",Lexus
"Those weren’t the cheapest ones too… I know right? Since I priced them out, I’m allowed to talk  now? 

Cheers. Keep overpaying for your stuff. 👌🏼


Edit: not surprised he deleted his comment. 

To answer his last comment: it’s only an 8 year difference between the 98 ls400 and OPs GS. I priced out front pads which are larger than rear as OP is doing so price difference between year and front and back should be close enough to use as a comparison. 

Why you delete your comment?",Lexus
The tire pressure sensors only last 10 years. It’s 400ish to replace them. But you can just not worry about it if you don’t want to swap them. This is a known to g.,Lexus
The dealer claims it’s 2 owners but when they registered it and another dealer bought it it creates duplicates,Lexus
I recently watched a review on a GS F and the best way they could’ve described it is a modern bmw e39 m5 if it was Japanese,Lexus
Nice and here I am with an SC430 loving it after 5 years in a CT.  I can only imagine how awesome that is.  I plan to go LC one day,Lexus
"It's not just brakes it's calipers too

But yes way over priced for only rear",Lexus
"I went to look at an older LS and some of those features made me think “wow, I wish my LC had this.”  Like, why don’t I have a wine cooler?? And mine is a top trim LC too!  I don’t even drink but I still want the feature haha.

Edit cause I don’t remember the year LS I looked at.",Lexus

"My 2014 had the high pressure fuel pump replaced for free under recall, I believe around 2019 or so.",Lexus

Right above the hazard switch you’ll see a mark levinson audio badge. And does it have the heated steering wheel or bsm?,Lexus
"I honestly don’t get the point of the 450h. I settled for a 350h. The 350h gets 40mpg. The 450h has about 35-40 miles of range. At most you’re saving a gallon of gas a day if you only charge at home overnight. For a 10k premium, it doesn’t make sense to me.",Lexus
Dammm that’s amazing you did that haha,Lexus
Now that’s an upgrade!,Lexus
And in Lexus 212 Obsidian Black Exterior paint and LA28 Black Interior Trim.,Lexus
"I’m team Lexus (hell, I’ve owned one for over a decade) but between the two options, there’s no contest tbh. The GV70 looks awesome, drives well, and has a ton of standard features. Reliability seems to be decent so far too. The biggest deterrent is the dealer network, but Genesis is hard at work one that at the moment. The RX isn’t bad, but to me, it doesn’t win any categories against the GV70, aside from reliability. Now if it were the new RX, it would be a more difficult choice for me…



Don’t take my Lexus membership card away please lol.",Lexus
"It happens, cars go through a lot with us, they help us get to different and better places in our lives and memories are made so it's natural.  But congratulations, very nice upgrade.",Lexus
Agree 100% my dealer is excellent both sales and service that alone has me sold as a return customer,Lexus
Wow that’s very cheap or maybe us prices are heavily inflated lol,Lexus
"No.  Bleach will not help for a clogged sunroof drain.  It does, however, work for a clogged AC drain because of the goo/snot that inevitably clogs the piping to the outside of the house.",Lexus
"me gusto hermano, beautiful 😍",Lexus
"Some guy owned mine for like 5 years and only put 5k miles on it, then the 2nd owner put like 25k on over the next 4, but was convinced there was a problem with the car, despite the technician saying the high pressure fuel pump is supposed to sound like that, but he got pissed paid 2k for a new OEM pump and traded it in. Now it's mine, lol. I'll be the last owner.",Lexus
Ah geez!! 😁,Lexus
That's crazy good looking,Lexus
I have one. What’s the point between this car and the grand highlander? You can just get the grand highlander for cheaper and honestly they don’t really differ. They kinda look the same and the highlander is 10k cheaper. Granted the tx is a hybrid but if you’re buying a 50k car it doesn’t really matter.,Lexus
They are discontinued. Value will only go higher,Lexus
What have you done to it?,Lexus
"It’s 10 years old and still
Looks better than 2024 vehicles. ⭐️",Lexus
"my 2019 IS gives me the ""would you like to take a break? ☕""  alert once the car has been on for ~2 hours, but it doesn't seem related to any actual movements.",Lexus
"I'd go with white, as it'll nicely complement the chateau interior.",Lexus
Crop dust mode,Lexus
That I didn’t know. Pretty cool. I still want to own an LS from the early 2000s.,Lexus
up yours too brah,Lexus
"Going back to relevant topics - the Is350 vs Camry, the Lexus will be a lot more nimble, camry will have a floatier ride. Also RWD vs FWD. I'd go for the IS350 everyday unless i needed the space",Lexus
LOL I am not gonna fix it,Lexus
You can buy just the mirror glass. It’s not that expensive.,Lexus
It’s nice! Congratulations!!🍾,Lexus
Have you driven a new one?,Lexus
Pretty standard dealership pricing. Labor is inflated and you are getting OEM parts at cost plus 15-20%.,Lexus
Some shops will just charge a higher hourly rate on customer supplied parts. Some will charge the norm and have no issue with bringing your own parts. And yeah some won’t allow it. All just depends on the shop really.,Lexus
Will never understand new vehicle purchases.,Lexus
wow that's dedication. so you been driving an LS around since what 14 ?,Lexus
I don't have the money to do so right now.,Lexus
Now that’s an upgrade … Sweet car!,Lexus
"I had this issue multiple times recently whilst they were doing a platform update. You need to email customer support using the email in the app and get them to reset the account so it can be added to your app again. They had to do this 2 or 3 times for me.

For some reason if it gets removed or you remove it from the app it doesn't let you re-add it without intervention from their end.

It's been weeks without any data in the app for me but it finally started working the other day.",Lexus
"Thanks for this question, I am supposed to pick up a NX350h next month too and will be driving 3hrs at similar speeds. Do your local dealers plan to not give VIP service because you bought from elsewhere?  You’d think it shows enough brand loyalty if you went that far to get Lexus.",Lexus
"It's a warning light and means that arrows will soon blot out the sun. Seek shelter.

(Have you considered reading your car's manual?)",Lexus
"If I ever trade this car in, a GS would more than likely be the move.",Lexus
"Thanks, I’ll look into it then!",Lexus
Buff right out,Lexus
I’m in love too,Lexus
You should have died in this accident and you’re bitching about financials? For fucks sake bro,Lexus
Comfort and quietness? seems like RX is considered more luxury than,Lexus
"ES350 is more your comfortable cruiser, it's FWD. IS350 is slightly sportier being RWD and more power. I'd personally take the IS every day of the week",Lexus
"They make more money on labor than the parts. They just won’t warranty the parts. OP, I just got quoted 1600 for my bmw from a local independent shop for brakes and rotors. Check out Nubrakes, it’s cheaper and they come to your house. If I buy the parts, the labor alone is still almost a grand..",Lexus
I'd avoid the ultra luxury just for the air suspension. It's nice but not worth it. Rear massage seats are cool but you'll never experience them. - had an 05 ls430 ,Lexus
"I did lol, test drove it 2 weekends ago. Amazing car but they wanted $66k + dealer fees and a $1500 anti-theft device installed. They weren’t going to budge on price unfortunately.",Lexus
How much? What year?,Lexus
"it's somewhat easy to put on, i can probably do it in 5-10 min. first time doing it will take around 30min. in order to just throw it on in a parking lot then you'll need some battery adapter so you can use the car battery to power up the fans",Lexus
No I got the shaft with that one. But it’s okay I used daddy’s Amex,Lexus
"Lexus owners get bored of their darn reliable Lexus. For some it’s just not exciting enough. I am 7 year 1st owner of an RX. I am bored of it. I can’t justify selling it. I keep delaying the decision every 6 months. Some are not so stingy like me.

If the car checks out then go for it !",Lexus
"Tighten the 10 mm bolt, it should stop.",Lexus
"Just drive them. The products sells itself. No one has to convince you, all you have to do is drive them.",Lexus
"I used Meguiars Compound, very lightly and then buff it ip",Lexus
"Congrats & welcome to the Lexus family, OP! My Lexa is like yours, metallic white all around! Here’s hoping you get LOTS of looks & compliments as you’re driving around time. 🫶🏼👍🏼💖👏🏼🫶🏼",Lexus

This is one sexy looking Lexus brotha! 🔥,Lexus
I'd rather just remove it all and have my engine bay clearly visible. It also seems to be counter intuitive to retain more heat as plastic wiring harnesses and components can degrade quicker when exposed to those types of conditions with no real advantage to noise suppression.,Lexus

">No residence, no identification over there, nothing like that at all to register out of state, easiest state to register in

That's awesome! Did you have to drive to SD and go in to their DMV to get this done?",Lexus
"Do not get an ISF. Literally this weekend I went and drove a ISF and a RCF less then an hour apart. The RC F is so much better it’s insane. The rear seats are practically the same (non existent). The engine is up on power compared to the IS F. Imo the design is a lot better compared to pre facelift isfs. The interior is also night and day, it’s so much worse in the ISF just because of age. Now the price difference is a little bit, the ISF I saw was 31k for a 2008 with 130k miles and like 7 owners. The rcf was 38k for a 2016 with 80k miles and 2 owners. Seriously at that difference in price, even if you can’t afford it at this time, it makes no sense to not just save up a little more for the RCF.",Lexus

Yeah look it up. Iirc the genesis is one of the most unreliable vehicles. They are sharp looking though,Lexus

"LOL. I do appreciate is f but truly think older Lexus or even old eco boxes look better. 90’s, early 2000’s.

can confirm am 19 and bought a 19 rc 350 f sport for 38k regret financing but love the car and can comfortably make triple the minimum payment ymmv i just hate being in debt.,Lexus
I have a TL now and looking to join the Lexus family - initially looking at the IS but rather get the GS (still sporty and I would get the mid size sedan that I'm accustomed to). I'm going to still keep my eye out for a GS and hopefully someone will let theirs go. Thanks for your sharing your personal account of your ES I found it helpful!,Lexus

"In this case, I took my car to a shop where they painted my calipers and applied the decals. On my last Lexus, I painted them myself. I purchased the spray paint, caliper decals, already had the prepping materials on hand to clean the calipers. It cost under $20 for me to paint them when I did it for my GS. There are tons of vids on YouTube on painting calipers, the process is straightforward but time consuming. This time around, I wanted professionals to do it for better results + saving time.",Lexus

I can get an oil change with Mobil 1 and Toyota/Lexus brand filter for around $55 locally.  I plan to keep my vehicle long-term (well beyond warranty period), and the more frequent oil changes definitely won't hurt anything.  You may want to check out the Car Care Nut on Youtube.

Yup lol did you ever go look at it,Lexus
I think it’s just a waste of plastic to do that imo design wise,Lexus
Bose for some suspension project on LS400 back in the days but it was not a commercial product. Harman Kardon that owns Mark Levinson. Sachs that was on GSF. And of course Yamaha to go develop engines for few models including the LFA.,Lexus

Same thing happened to me, raining, night, unfamiliar roads, pot hole filled with water, BAM, bent both my BBS driver side wheels. Any other cast wheels for sure would have just cracked. My tires also had that same kind of damage as yours. I needed new tires anyways so I'm happily changing all 4.

As for my BBS OE wheels, the bend was on the face side, it doesn't leak air but no longer balanced. I went to 2 professional wheel fix shops here, both said they couldn't fix it on the face side or just refused. 3rd place said they could try, but couldn't guarantee it won't crack further down the line. New BBS wheels are not cheap and sadly I skipped out on the wheel insurance. Thankfully, I got real lucky I found a set from an IS350 in a junkyard with the DHP package that has the BBS wheels in excellent condition for a fraction of the cost.",Lexus

It must depend on the particular salesman. I am in the middle of waiting for an RX 350 H to be delivered and it’s like pulling teeth getting updates… being left on read with my texts etc. it’s almost the opposite of the cliché overbearing salesman.

"Ha! I was going to ask. However, it bet it would be a nice car to go out and drive in Germany. 

I have mine in Seattle USA. Most of our roads are bad. Like really bad. I love the roads in the Netherlands. It would be nice to have better roads to drive it on, but it sure makes the bumps smooth!",Lexus
"Mind elaborating? I was cross shopping both at one point and just am not seeing where Lexus in terms of interiors wins over Genesis. Maybe I am missing something. Genesis interiors have better materials and far more unique designs. I rented a new NX on Turo when I was travelling and the passenger dashboard looked straight out of a base model economy car, just zero design and lots of plastics.",Lexus
"Me too, I really wish they’d have some dark red/burgundy options like they did on the LS in I think 2019",Lexus

Yeah we bought a stock exhaust from them,Lexus
Yes I think the best GS imo is the GS 450h plenty of torque and power and smiles for miles. Partial to it since I have one and my other half has a GS 350. I’d love to replace my GMC with a GX in the future.,Lexus
I love this ES look esp in the gold. Are they a lot slower than the IS models?,Lexus
Very nice! Basic maintenance ( 5k mile oil changes and transmission drain and fill every 40k miles ) and she’ll just go and go and go,Lexus
I would also have a favorite but the OCD part of my brain would go insane looking at 1 balloon car and 1 deflated balloon car,Lexus
"Very nice, have you looked into upgrading the lower control arm bushings? It’s a few hundred bucks and is a worthwhile upgrade as it makes the steering sportier and respond/feel better. It also prevents potential tire mis wear. There are 2 options really, the RCF bushing which is a marginal improvement and is a bit cheaper, and a full polyurethane bushing which is a more noticeable improvement. Something like  figs bushing would be a good choice. The RC F bushing I know doesn’t increase harshness at all and the polyurethane from my research has very minimal increase if any noticeable and should keep the comfy ride of a RC with a improved sporty edge",Lexus
sheeeeeesh,Lexus
Even better just drive to autozone and get a free scan from them,Lexus
"Thankfully I have a 2016 as well and yes, a 911 would be a logical upgrade. Happy driving!",Lexus
Yea hate it,Lexus
"Yeah I’ve been listening to all of them and getting their opinions it’s really good advice, I’m still interested in a Lexus but I should for sure look towards saving money so I’ll search for some older models",Lexus
"The recommended is a cold, as in hasnt been driven and parked out of the sun for hours, pressure. Normal variation with driving can be up around 10% or higher.

Those are the best Lexus’ to buy when they sell them,Lexus
"They fairly order the correct part though. They have a 95 Camry but bought 97 Camry parts. This part is for the 3.5L, your car is a 2.4L. Never fails",Lexus
They did not produce a lot and I would compare it to a grand tourer more than a sports car. I was looking at the F-Pace and DB9 but decided on the LC for reliability and it retains more value in the long run. I doubt it will ever shoot up in price like an LFA but i have a feeling these will be sought after once they are no longer available.,Lexus
I agree. Cars like these look cleanest in stock form. That’s how I keep my GS 350.,Lexus
"We have 6 LC, a IS500 and a RC.",Lexus
Yeah the wheel gap is bad and I really want to cut it down. Still undecided between springs or coil overs but my main goal is to minimize the gap. Also don’t want to kill ride quality but I’m gonna have to make some compromise it seems.,Lexus

I’m not sure where you are located or what coverage you have but my premiums did not go up. I have glass coverage with Geico in New York and the damage occurred in Maryland. It’s essentially classified as “act of God/chance” and not your fault and my insurance company understood this. Just check with your provider to confirm any potential changes to your premium of you were to file a glass claim.,Lexus

Vert, the last quote I got had a $10k markup but you can probably get for MSRP.  There are a lot more that are sitting.

I refuse to pay markup though, my local Lexus dealers are a joke.",Lexus

SUV's got really popular and everyone wanted one of those at the time and the demand for sedans obviously tanked so they discontinued the GS 😔,Lexus
"really it jus depends. my first LS430 had like 6 owners from 2001-2007 then one owner for the rest of the time. 

i just bought a 2006 accord for $2000, from the original owner. So it really just depends",Lexus
Why get rid of the ISF?! Now that’s a real car right there! You should keep it!,Lexus
I agree. Getting remanufactured calipers on the rear for those cars is wasting money tbh,Lexus
What??? Yeah it was random like a lot of ppl car pics. It was parked getting the tire fixed.,Lexus
"They didn’t make very many GS’ compared to other models and people hang onto them forever. When I was looking for my GS, it took me about 6 weeks to find the right one. I checked out at least 150 listings before finding my current car, and it was about 3 hours away. I barely ever see any GS of any generation on the road, and I’ve seen another luxury package 4GS exactly once. I don’t plan on ever selling mine either so I get it lol",Lexus
"I live in an extreme hot and dry desert climate, and I have seen these make it to 600-800k km. 

In fact the mechanic that performed the inspection had a 600k km LS460, which I test drove, and which also feel like new. 

That 4.6 port & direct injected V8, with the 8 speed auto, is literally insane. The smoothest most reliable V8 ever made period.

The whole driving experience just lowers your stress level. Add to that the ML surround and it’s an unmatched experience.

I mean sure, an S class is probably also amazing, but for me, knowing that I can have this enjoyment for another 400k km and 20 years if I maintain it properly is a whole other level.",Lexus

It was the same situation with the RC, but when I called the dealer up and gave them my vin, they said the RC springs would fit on my 22, even though there website listed the fitment only up to the 2020 MY. Basically there website wasn’t updated, it could be the same case with the IS.",Lexus

what model is this? dope asf,Lexus
"FB marketplace, keep in mind there are scams (check sellers profile to make sure they haven’t listed the same car numerous times) and never send money without meeting the seller in person and seeing the car but for the most part you’ll be fine. Most of the really good deals don’t last long but the fb market algorithm is great so once you search for a Lexus (model) it will show you more and more each day of what you’re looking for (especially if you use filters) that way you see the new listings daily and can catch them quick before someone else does. Here in FL, I’ve seen 2013 es350 with 100k miles listed for $12.5k(might’ve sold for even less) and is250, I believe 2011-12 100-120k at around $8k-10k. You have to be quick with those because people scoop these cars up. Any Lexus, Toyota, Honda, Acura will go super quick because they’re know for reliability. Good luck, if you need any more help let us know.",Lexus
"TPMS sensor battery dying. Even of just one is going bad, none of them will display on little older Lexus. Batteries age with time, not mileage.

"You can go aftermarket glass for much less. It may not have the auto-dimming or blind-spot features. And won’t match the driver’s side.

You can do this your self for like $400 at most.,Lexus
I think most body shops are quite behind. We had someone back into our Palisade and it took about 75 days to get repaired. It was less than $1k in damage.,Lexus
Thought you were using a gray filter at first lol,Lexus
Those covers do not make the car quieter at all. Sound deadening from the firewall and floor board reduce cabin sound. Those plastic covers do not have sound deadening material underneath them. The one that does is the valve cover but having it off doesn’t increase cabin noise.,Lexus
They also have one that’s been sitting inside one of the service bays they don’t use. Looks like someone had a good time with it and neglected it for the extent of ownership and just dumped it. The service advisors didn’t even know why it was sitting there. And that was not one of the LC’s pictured lol,Lexus

"I guess all you'd need to do is dry contact the shifter switches that cause the transmission to move up and down, and extend those to some paddles behind the wheel. So technically possible.

They are a bit of a gimmick with lexus 6 speed autos though, I have the paddle shifters and find it better to use the stick instead because it's more like a gear limit on a traditional auto (3, 2, L) than actually shifting yourself.",Lexus

That is a normal price to replace a mirror nowadays, so if you’re happy with the price it’s probably not worth making a stink about beyond the phone call.

"Hey! I also went from the TL to the GS and came to the same conclusion as you. The ES felt really boring (sorry lol) and would be a great car but it felt like it lacked character in the exterior. The IS was too small for me and I also didn't entirely like how small it looked either. But, oh my god does the GS feel better in every single way imaginable than the TL. I drove a lot of different Lexus cars, over 30 total in my search and my favorite was definitely the LS 460 but those are way too expensive. I do like the ES in general though, especially the new 300h models. Those look really clean and have great mpg. Anyways, let me know if you have any questions.",Lexus
$1200 ??,Lexus
What website is the listing on?,Lexus
"Haven’t looked into that yet. Last week I installed a strut bar. Just like my GS, it instantly made a noticeable difference with body roll and I’m happy now. With this car, I’m leaning towards keeping stock suspension. Lowering springs would like nice but really don’t wanna go that route tbh",Lexus

"i think location is honestly more important; some dealerships are more transparent than others, and it reflects in their language, their candidness, while others are… just not as good. but you’re right, generally speaking a lot of people have expectations about luxury cars and smart dealerships will play into to attract people and keep their business",Lexus

Also looking at melting door cards and dash, Valve Spring issues and of course air suspension. 

The LS460 can easily be mechanically totalled and have repairs bills higher than the initial purchase of the car itself. It really is like owning a german car and has a lot of engineering similar to BMW/Mercedes",Lexus

For reference I have a LS460 f sport which has “AVS” which has the actuator you mention but it also has the air suspension so I never really know if AVS by default means just actuators to adjust the dampeners or air suspension + actuators.

The post-pandemic WFH change fucked up my sleep pattern. I had 2 crashes in the past 2 years.
Basically ""switched off/blacked out"" like a light then found myself :

1) crashed into a pole after moving from stop sign.

2) crashed into bush on a quiet-ish road.

So any 2011+ I’d say I want to look for the 2016-2020 range I’m trying my best to save money. As for the milage isn’t 90K miles high? I’ve never did proper research on Lexus but I do know they’re pretty similar to Toyota. For milage I’d say I’d want to look for the 25K-55K range. What do you think? Also for the financial advice on Reddit which subreddits should I ask for that? Thanks a lot by the way you’ve been plenty helpful,Lexus

"Honestly, depends on what you want. The GV70 is going to be way more sporty and have a higher tech interior while the RX will be more comfortable but quite a lot slower, and won’t handle as sharply. Also, space, the RX is a class above in size. I have test driven both and I would personally take the X3 M40i above both of them but the GV70 over the the RX, I don’t need the space and the way the Lexus wafts is not for me. The lean in the corners is fucking awful, plus it feels very anemic when you put your foot down.

"$450 is probably around what a new OEM one costs from the dealer. That's what I did when mine went out on my 3GS because i do not trust remans for anything that spins.... It was an AWD and absolutely a pain to get to, if you're AWD expect more labor time.

"Christ, that’s ridiculous. If the caliper isn’t corroded all to hell the most likely reason for sticking is the caliper pins need cleaning and re-greasing with caliper specific grease - never never use anything else. Maybe it needs new seals too, that’s $30 max for a rebuild kit, as long as the piston isn’t corroded. The rotors may still have enough material to be turned, an auto parts store can check them and turn them for no more than $20 per rotor depending on where you live. If not, OEM rotors are $200 max. OEM pads are $70. This is not a difficult job but if you don’t want to screw with it then I guarantee you can find a good independent shop that won’t bleed you dry. Dealerships are for warranty work and highly specific repairs that no one else wants to mess with. I have never needed a new caliper, even in cars and trucks over 200k miles. I needed a seal kit exactly once.",Lexus

I’d definitely keep it stock, lowered is nice but stock is hard to beat especially with ride quality and not having to think about if you’re gonna scrape. When I changed the lower control arm bushings on my 3GS it was a pretty instant improvement, granted my bushings were worn out but still made a noticeable improvement. And I only went with the GS F bushings and those are still pretty tame. Lower control arm bushings are a great upgrade for the N platform Lexus cars and really everyone should upgrade them, easy and pretty cheap and gives the car a better feel and prevents tire wear that’s common on especially IS models",Lexus

"I'm an oil nerd and will almost always tell people to go 10-20k/yearly with a good filter. However the Toyota engines seem to be sensitive to longer OCIs and the oil guys recommend 5k on synthetic, not 10k. It seems there has been a pattern to some failures and they are almost always 10k change people (as recommended by Toyota) IIRC the Toyota Master Tech guy on YouTube recommends 5k changes and especially change the first one soon. If you feel like digging you can find out the reason why or specific failure points, I don't remember. Might have been timing chain related on one engine.

"Well first let’s talk money, what’s your salary, rent / expenses, how much you got in savings?

Insurance rates, interest rates, fuel costs, maintenance, etc, are all high now - everything is expensive. So when you calculate your monthly budget, you need to accommodate those additional costs. At 20, you’re paying double the insurance you’ll pay at 28. 

The best thing you can do is to keep that purchase price down, pay cash, and buy something reliable and easy to maintain. 

Let’s say you bought a 2012 ES with 100k miles for 11-12k in great condition, 90k service done, passes a PPI.  You’re insurance will be MUCH cheaper, it’s a great comfortable and reliable car with lots of storage and room for friends. Very reliable engine and FWD system that is easy on your tires and brakes. 

In 5 years, you can upgrade if you wind up getting ahead financially - and because you bought this car at 12k, you’ll sell it for like 8k, and your yearly cost to own is low, because you bought a car that already took its major depreciation hits. 

I think a mid 2010s IS 350, and not going for one will staggered wheels / run flats, is a good value buy as well. Fun sporty sedan, cramped backseat and less storage, but it’s got a naturally aspirated 300hp+ engine and RWD, it is fun while still being practical and affordable. 

Buying new now is rough - with what I assume is your starting out credit, age, income history, you will get shit rates (I mean, everyone gets shit rates now). The WORST thing you could do is to take a high interest, 72 month loan on a 45k car that will also cost you $250 a month to insure, 5k in straight up sales tax, and so on. Calculate the money spent on that vehicle over 5 years, it’s a true 60k+ expense.",Lexus

If no one reaches out, call again and ask for the company and policy # to file a claim yourself. If they fight you, have an attorney send them a letter of representation. That should prompt filing the claim and having the insurance company investigate. But seems they owe you a motor",Lexus

"Get a pre purchase inspection for sure, and make sure maintenance has been done properly. Take it for a long test drive and put it through its paces and make sure everything feels good. If that all checks out I’d go ahead and change ALL the fluids (emphasis on transmission fluid) just to be safe. These do have intake valve carbon build up but it’s not a big deal and you can get that properly cleaned at a shop for a few hundred bucks and not have to deal with it again for a few years. Keep changing the engine oil every 5k miles and she should treat you well",Lexus

"Advice from a claims adjuster:

Get a quote from a shop who works with your insurance company, tell them you want it quoted as if it was for a claim to see if it'll be over or under your deductible. if the quote is less than your comprehensive deductible don't file a claim. If its more than your deductible, file the claim, pay your deductible and use a shop contracted with your insurance company so if something does go wrong with the repairs your insurance company can throw their weight around and help you and get it fixed. They have no weight if the shop isn't contracted with them.

Also file a police report (usually online) because solid chance your insurance company may require it be filed Ina certain time from the theft attempt.

As for ways to better protect your car, park in a private garage if you can, if you cant, try and block the Rx into your parking space or driveway with another vehicle.",Lexus

"I would have the transmission drain and fill with a filter change and magnet cleaning, then a few thousand miles later I would do another drain and fill to get most of the old fluid out then I’d stick to a 40k mile fluid drain and fill interval. The timing chain cover shouldn’t cause a burning smell since it’s not leaking onto the exhaust, maybe you have a valve cover leak which is an easy fix and should only be a few hundred dollars if that is the case. You could tell her to keep the car on recirculating so it doesn’t pull the outside air giving that burning smell",Lexus
Refresh doesn’t mean redesign. The LC has always been a more bespoke vehicle in the lineup. Lexus knew it won’t be a volume seller. It was more of a design showcase to fill the gap in their lineup (and a great one at that!) which is why they never really made a lot of money on it.,Lexus
"Yeah, I know Lexus says 10k-mile interval for synthetic oil changes, but I get all of our family's Lexus vehicles' oil changed between 6k to 8k miles (about every 6 months for us, we drive quite a bit).

The parts are easily accessible too the consumer from the dealers and For Toyota/lexus , Online Dealer parts is where it’s at. Tustin Toyota Online parts are by far the cheapest Genuine parts from any dealer throughout the country I’ve seen if you want to go and give that a try. You’ll save like 1300 if you learn to do it yourself. I wouldn’t resurface the rotors as the metal warps and internal metal as well, when you resurface the rotor,it’s like putting a band aid and too me it’s  much better alternative to just change the rotor with a new one since they’re like $68 a piece for say a 2018 Toyota Tacoma from the dealer.

That is CRAZY! Straight robbery man don’t do it!! I can not believe that quoted you $1700!!!

Omg smh 🤦🏻‍♂️,Lexus
"I have both the Gv70 3.5t and the Rx 350 f sport. If you're looking for reliability the Rx 350 is a no brainer but it's a snooze fest to drive imo. 

If you're looking for something that is more fun, engaging and has better looks get the Gv70. I have driven both trims and if you can't afford to get the 3.5T id just get the Rx 350 tbh. The 3.5t is a very fun to drive and also has a more aggressive look than the model you posted. The 3.5/2.5 trim variants look great and you'll get more attention in any of them compared to the Rx 350 but In my opinion I think the 2.5 isn't worth the money. 

I have around 34k miles on my Gv70 3.5t and haven't had any issues yet. Also genesis has a pretty good complimentary service for 5 years or 62k miles(what ever comes first). 

At the end of the day you can't go wrong with the rx350, it's my daily driver and if you told me to pick one to drive for a life time I'd pick the Rx 350 without hesitation. 

Hope that helps",Lexus

"Just tickles me when people buy a premium vehicle then expect to pay economy prices for maintenance and repair.

Agree with upkeep - since I outright buy older cars I always expect to drop some $ on a repair once a year or so (I got a budget for this) and I get things knocked out immediately if it's safety/urgent like brakes or non urgent things I can wait awhile per the tech (if they are like you got another x miles with whatever before it becomes serious).,Lexus

From what I could tell, if you ever have to move large objects or something in the back, you can fold down the seats but from what I could tell, the center console protruded up past the folded down seats. That says to me you’re more prone to damaging that console. Even the new CX-90 is doing the same thing and you lose features going down a trim just to not have the captains chairs which is really dumb.

Did you just buy your UX?,Lexus
"They sell fairly well for an high luxury GT car. In this segment selling like 1000 a year isn't bad. Which is part of the reason for the high price, with the low volume they need higher margins.",Lexus
"I did a ton of research before buying my GS cause I was torn between luxury and F sport and trust me you made the right decision (and got lucky with finding the rarest available GS spec, a 2014 luxury package). With the luxury package you get the same exact suspension, exhaust, engine and transmission as the f sport, the only drivetrain differences are the smaller rims (so you have a smoother ride and worse handling, but they’re a way nicer design) and smaller non-F brakes. Unlike the f sport, we have 18 way seats for both front passengers (instead of 16 way driver and the base model 10 way passenger on the f), 3 way memory passenger seat, 3 zone climate control, side rear shades, actual wood trim, butterfly headrests, and some have heated rear seats which was only available on the luxury. The 2014 adds automatic climate control seats and power folding mirrors, as well as the ability to option a power trunk (none of which was available on my 2013 luxury). Congratulations, you won the GS lottery haha",Lexus
The RX is just ugly. It’s their last generation design and it needs to end.,Lexus
"I think you’ve gotten hit with every expensive repair on this car you can get, sucks but it is a 13 year old vehicle but now you’ve got another 13 years without repairing any of that stuff. In these early years of RXs timing chain cover leaks are common and typically not a big deal as they leak extremely slow in most cases. I personally wouldn’t fix it and deal with it as it likely won’t even leave a drop on your driveway and just make sure to check your oil every month to see if it actually is dropping. These engines are bulletproof but again you’re gonna have to repair things over time. As long as you keep your engine oil changed and transmission fluid changed she’ll run for many years to come (emphasis on transmission fluid since a lot of people neglect it and it’s VERY important and a transmission is more expensive than an engine to replace).",Lexus

"I'm new to lexus as me and my wife owned kia and genesis products for almost the last 10 years, our dealer expirences were less than desirable and why we loved our vehicles the quality just wasn't there. both vehicles had to be fully repainted and the interiors did not hold up. This isn't a dig at the brand but its just my expirence. 4 months into our new lexus vehicles and I have no complaints and the dealer has been excellent. That might not be long enough for a respectful opinion but just My 2 cents",Lexus
"They were not available as an add-on. These wheels are exclusive to the luxury. Either you have the luxury and don’t know it, or someone bought the wheels aftermarket and put them on. Do you have Sport S+ mode and the 18 way front seats? Or the rear climate controls in the center armrest?",Lexus
That's a frigging chill upgrade! Congrats man,Lexus
They did the wood in some of the vehicles too. Like my LS. Same wood they use in their grand pianos.,Lexus
"That’s a good finance guy then! The reason Lexus has the “10k mile” oil changes is to make maintenance costs seem cheaper and I guess convince buyers to get their cars? Anyway all Lexus/Toyota certified mechanics and really mechanics in general will recommend the 5k mile or 6 month changes. And that’s even more important to follow on this car since it is turbocharged which breaks down the oil even faster than a regular naturally aspirated engine. The saying goes oil is cheap, engines are expensive",Lexus
"That's a lovely looking car! I own a 2006 LS430 and also keep it like yours.

I did not have issues; I dropped the car for 25k service and was really busy with something when they called me and told me that pads are worn out and needs to be replaced. I agreed without realizing that rotors will be resurfaced too.

I think buying new rotors with performance pads was a better deal for me. It may have ended up costing more, but I am sure that stopping power of my breaks would have improved considerably.",Lexus

"Just Yamaha and officially only once.

&#x200B;

Lexus worked with Yamaha on the exhaust tuning (sound) for the LF-A and converted an RC-F's V8 to run on hydrogen but no one ever said if Lexus helped with it.

Besides that really no one. Lexus borrows anything extra it needs from Toyota who has worked with a ton of companies, so anything Lexus would borrow or use likely was done via that company and Toyota for a Toyota car and Lexus said ""Hey big bro that looks nice, can I borrow it?""

&#x200B;

Yamaha manufactured and did a ton of work with the 2000GT but no other companies I could find Lexus has worked with.",Lexus

"Until someone hits it & the insurance says its worth far less than repairs cost & they total it out. (My 08 ES350 has been hit 6 times now & never my fault! I picked it up from last body repair on Jan 8th & March 9th a teenager ran into right corner rear trying to park. I also parked at farthest end of lot to avoid people!!) I knew the insurance was trying to total it when they asked for additional photos that include seats, steering wheel, stereo, & dash, after receiving initial requested photos of 4 corners, Vin & damage.",Lexus

"Control arms are probably the most expensive LS460 exclusive repair that comes up. It has the usual UR engine quirks like valley plate leak, but due to the crammed engine bay the job is more expensive than on other Lexus V8 cars.

How much did you lease it for if you don't mind me asking?,Lexus
"From the looks of it we have the same gen ES350 lol I personally don’t mind the plastic as it keeps things a little bit cleaner and reduces some noise but not much. However, ripping it off is always silly to me because it’s there for a reason and when you rip it off if you ever resell someone else looking will say “wtf where’s the covers” lol. However if you’re a at home mechanic and don’t mind the look by all means rip it off and save it, if you re sell, or scrap it if you drive cars til they die. But I always say best place to store them when you take them off is in the most convenient place and out of the way which is……. Right back where you took em off of lol",Lexus

"> I *paid* 25k, and

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

"I just did some more digging cause I'm genuinely curious but it looks like that was part of the exhaust part, they ""assisted"" Lexus (Toyota) in engineering them again for exhaust sound.

So I guess they likely assisted in everything exhaust related so the manifold, muffler, the cat placement/size/type, etc etc, so everything entering and then leaving the engine but not the engine itself. Or I'm thinking WAY to much into this and it was as basic as Yamaha said ""It sounds good"" so Lexus could use it in marketing to sell the LF-A considering how much of a sales flop the LF-A was.",Lexus

"i have a '24 is350 (previously had a '21) and my brother has a '17 es350. 

es350 is the greatest comfort daily driver ever. if you only care about comfort and going a -> b, there is no better daily. it will eat miles and you can feel great even doing things like 100 mile roundtrips daily for work or whatever

is350 is not quite as comfortable, but it is far more fun to drive. you still get the same build quality in the touch points barring the piano black. it has a tighter turn radius and the handling is very good. there's also options for rwd/awd in the is350 and the awd system is actually quite good if you aren't considering rwd for whatever reason

the es feels like a boat, while the is350 is more engaged. do note that these are both still lexus products, so you're still going to have the more comfortable and muted drivetrains. if you want something driver's focused, check out other brands (alfa, bmw, genesis)",Lexus

It all depends on how mechanically inclined you are. After twenty years I decided to look how to do my Lexus 2000 Rx300. Man it was easy. Top quality pads and rotors $350. It was my first time. It took me two hours taking my time. I even flush and bleed the brake fluid. I watch YouTube how to do it. I use the car jack and put an extra support in the middle of the axle for support. The labor $1350; it takes them 60 minutes max to do this. Yes very pricy but what choice do you have?,Lexus

It's beautiful. I have a 2010 LS460 sport. Love the car. Does have some front end issue I need to address.,Lexus
"I have owned two 96’s and currently have a 97. 

I like the boxier front end and harder lines over the 98-00. The 98-00 and the 01-3 LS 430 are somewhat similar. Both have the same transmission, VVTi. I already have all that stuff in my LS 430, and I really appreciate the four speed in the 95-7 over the five in my 430. The whole experience is just different, maybe a little more connected to you as the driver. The point for me is that it’s different than the 430. If it were me in your shoes, I’d absolutely be looking for a 95-97 instead of a 98-00. 

Small point, I also think these cars look great with the antenna up, 98-00 doesn’t have one. I have never owned a 90-94, for some reason they don’t really interest me.",Lexus

Used LC500 is probably the best deal going for a luxury gt car.,Lexus
"Pretty much every lexus vehicle carries the same top-notch standard of quality and reliability. And not to say the es doesn't have fantastic road manners and handling as well, because it absolutely does. Just that the IS is more nimble and sporty, really. I was pretty floored when I had a 23 es300h loaner for a few days commuting in LA traffic. The car felt absolutely perfect in terms of balancing Serene cabin comfort with maneuverability and speed. The hybrid is not slow by any means, and I found it to be more than adequate for quick passing compared to my beastly 06 IS350 that I daily. So I do love the IS more at heart, but the new ES totally blew me away, too. Can't go wrong with either really unless you need to carry backseat passengers, then it's gotta be the ES. IS backseat is only for kids and small adults frankly.",Lexus

If you have the tools and know how it’s way cheaper to do it yourself.",Lexus
I love my LS430. Looking for LX470 right now.,Lexus
The 460 is on another level in terms of maintenance. Each injector is $400 for example.,Lexus
"I’m only a few years older than you but have had 13 cars. If you are fine with an older car don’t spend 35k or even 25k on a ISF. If you want luxury rwd V8 go with a E63, or if you are afraid of maintenance my favorite was the E55 AMG, super reliable, a 2005 is a timeless piece, very fast and comfy, and a lot of aftermarket support and general support. My next up was a 08 jeep srt8. I would still go E55. And you can get an amazing one for 15-20k. The few times I drive a ISF it was very underwhelming and under performed and felt old.",Lexus

this happened to my lexus RX a couple years back.  looks like there’s an issue with your moonroof or maybe a panel next to it. I got my car repainted and the shop didn’t install the panel on correctly so it ruined my interior. Cost me about 3k in damages. Probably take it to the dealership if you’re not sure how to fix it on your own.,Lexus
Really good deal. Is it awd?,Lexus

"I had the choice between a Luxury and F-Sport trim GS when I was shopping around. Both were Liquid Platinum on Flaxen with ML. I was so close to getting the Luxury trim for the rear seat control, cornering headlights, and extra comfy front seats but the F-Sport had the Rear Steering/HUD and looked so good so I opted for it. I definitely made the best choice for me, but miss some of those Luxury trim features.

"Looks like a decent price in the current market, ideally closer to 12k but it's hard to negotiate these down because it's hard to find a problem with them. Usually bad ownership leads to interior or exterior damage, mechanically only the suspension and tires may need replacing if it was driven hard. Confirm where it was owned, was it also owned in PA? I would ask a mechanic to put it on a lift and inspect for rust. Rust is inevitable up in the northeast, but your concern should be frame and subframe damage as well as any significant component rust. The battery is going to be far from new if it hasn't been replaced yet. Potentially may need new rotors/pads, and you may want to consider tuning up with some new belts, hoses, and spark plugs, though Lexus wisdom is don't touch, they're still breaking in, especially if they were serviced at interval. Confirm that timing belt and water pump were serviced around 100k and you're good till 200k.",Lexus

I’m 20 and I own and ‘08  that i bought for $27k. The only real major issue to lookout for is the Valley Plate Leak which can run you a good chunk of change especially if you take it to a dealer for service. Other than that change the fluids on time and you’ll be golden. Tires aren’t cheap ofc and i’m sure you’re aware of fuel economy. The 400 hp isn’t bad to handle at all and it’s a perfectly comfortable and reliable daily commuter. Perfect amount of power to have a blast but not too much to where you can’t have fun with it. Absolutely the best daily driver that can be had for under 30k in my opinion.,Lexus

Carbon buildup? Old ass engine being less efficient due to a variety of things? Suspension issues? Lotta things,Lexus
"It’s those stupid slide pins in the rear calipers which is probably what’s frozen. This era of Lexus/toyota used a shitty design and many people don’t service the rears often enough since the pads last a long time. If you can get the GD slide pins out (took me over an hour each side on my 06 RX, they were that stuck) you can clean off the pins with a wire brush and then clean out the channels they sit in as good as possible. 

Get a new slide bushing or leave it off, either way you want to ditch the old one which is probably swollen. Then line with 100% silicone lubricant. That should get you back in the game unless your shit is super rusted in which case you MAY need new pins and rear calipers.

In any case I’d try cleaning it up before spending a grand to replace. ",Lexus
"Great car at a fair price, what more could you ask for.  Congratulations",Lexus
Is LS more $$ to maintain and service vs ES? I’m looking at both currently.,Lexus

"Insurance doesn't go based on the price of the car....

It goes based off how frequently that make and model car get into accidents also the more power the car makes/if it's a sports car the more the insurance is because you're more likely to get in an accident add that with your age of 18 and limited amount of driving experience is going to be very expensive to insurance.

on top of dropping $35k at 18 it's just begging for financial ruin unless your parents are loaded and paying for everything. (And even then you could use that money to invest now and buy 5 ISFs when your in your 30s)

The chances of you having a job that will let you comfortably afford such a vehicle let alone the maintenance at 18 are slim to none.

Answer me this if you feel comfortable

Seriously contemplated upgrading to the GV70/80 Sport with the 3.5t engine. The tech, driving experience, and luxurious feel were an upgrade. The interior quality was about equivalent. Ultimately didn't pull the trigger because i was too worried about the reliability. Heard too many horror stories of electrical issues and mediocre dealership experiences. If I was going to lease, I'd get the Genesis without a second thought but I just don't want to deal with any potential headache of ownership out of warranty.

I'll most likely be replacing the RX with an Acura MDX A-spec. Still less reliable than Lexus but should be better than going Genesis.",Lexus

"* Battery shows: 12.51v and 568CCA but needs replacement?
   * 568CCA is perfectly acceptable for ES350. I think the OE battery is rated for around 580? This battery is probably rated for 700CCA or higher which is why it fails battery test.
* Sway bar/stabilizer is quoted at 492 for parts and labor.
   * Looks like just some grease seeping out of the joints, as long as there is not much play, it's fine.
* Control arm is quoted at 1110 for parts and labor
   * Quote sounds more like just ball joints...
   * Pictures actually just show the ball joints with grease seeping? Again, as long as there is not much play, it's fine. If they are referring to the control arm bushings though, need pictures to determine severity.
* Engine Motor mount crack (I dont see) but is at 2400$
   * Its just at very beginning stage of separating, not urgent. Also that quote might have an extra zero...
* CV axle shaft at 1400$
   * Quote sounds like they're just replacing the axle boots. Axles are like $600 each,  not including labor...unless they're quoting aftermarket axles? Don't replace them in that case, aftermarket axles are kind of hit-or-miss.
   * Picture 8 shows a hole in the CV boot, or maybe just a weird shadow as I don't see any grease leaking out. Actually zooming in, it just looks like some water.
   * Picture 9 has some grease seepage, not a big deal
   * Picture 10 looks like rust is flaking some paint/metal off, not really big deal

General rust looks superficial, but did notice in picture 12 that the body plugs are missing. Maybe still in the glovebox?

As far as pre-purchase inspection goes, this car is a good buy as long as the price is right. None of the items listed need to be urgently addressed, maybe just keep an eye on. Only thing I *might* replace is the battery, it'll probably still be fine for a year or two.",Lexus

"I can’t comment on the fuel mileage differences, but I can tell you there is a significant difference in overall size, ride, noise, ice nvh, and amenities. Hands down the RX450h+ has it all over the NX, but you’re going to pay for it. The RX450h+ has all the bells and whistles and is the top of the line trim. It is way quieter in road and wind noise and has significantly more interior space.The NX ice has noticeable noise when it fires off and the RX ice has a muted growl. The RX450h+ is a $75,000+ car, so it’s not for the common everyday person. We have put 1300+ miles on it and refilled the gas tank just once so far. The electric range started at 31 miles and now is up to 38 miles. One quirk: if you are to spend time sitting in the car…enjoying the view….reading a book….listening to music while your SO is shopping or whatever, either shut the car off totally or leave in hybrid mode as the 12v battery is easily discharged. This battery is charged when the hybrid system is operating indicated by “ready” in green letters on dash. The 12v battery does not charge while recharging the hybrid battery. In the case of the RX450h+, the 12v battery is has a mere 330 CCA rating. This most like applies to all current Toyota/Lexus plug in hybrids. My car is in for service, and I hope to confirm whether or not the 12v battery charges while in HV mode (with EV locked out).",Lexus
Got it for $19500 with a little under 120k on the odometer. So far it’s been a blast to drive,Lexus

"Makes sense, thank you for sharing! I am deciding between buying soon VS. in couple years. Might be worth waiting a bit then",Lexus
"Okay here is to answer your questions guys 😊 It was a 2015 Prius and I bought it brand new. I drove full time uber from 2015 to 2020 so that sums up pretty much why I got 400k miles from it. I drove pretty much like 10 to 12 hours a day mostly 5 to 6 days and I drive aggressive most of the time lol. First really major problem I had was the head gasket at around 230k miles I had those engine knocking and rattle when I start it up, it went on for about a year once in awhile until it made a check engine light about the misfiring issues and so that was the time I had the head gasket replace as well as the coolant, water pump and spark plugs. For the hybrid battery I replaced it at around 350k miles I was actually on the freeway and check engine light went on at it said check hybrid system stop the vehicle sort of like that I kind of got scared because I was driving 80mph when that happened. I called someone who has a Prius too who has 500k miles on it and he said the Prius is fine to drive for a couple days until you can replace the hybrid battery. It will just be like a regular car with and the gas will always be continuous because the hybrid battery failed already. I drove it for a couple of days before I replaced the hybrid battery. Honestly that’s about it, I never replaced the transmission fluid, inverter coolant and even the whole suspension system though you can hear some noise when braking downhill or going to some speed bumps.
I decided to say goodbye to it because once in a while I’m getting engine knock and rattle probably once or twice a week so I’m for sure know it needs to be replaced within a year or so and because and never replaced the other major parts too and I thought probably in the future they might give up too.

So yeah I definitely recommend the 2015 Prius to everyone who asked me about it especially if you aee just a regular driver or commuter. And then to all the people who laughed about the prius and all those memes. I probably got the last laugh 😅",Lexus

"‘Roadtrip’ sounds like this was a journey that was not an emergency. Probably something you’d planned out for a while (as most people would plan a roadtrip well in advance). If that was the case, then in spite of the fact you knew you had a road trip the next day you stayed up/didn’t sleep. 

And , like many of the other people have commented, and I have personally experienced, sleepiness while driving does not just switch on. There are a lot of signs. Personally at the first sign of grogginess I pull over and take a nap. 

This is so irresponsible and you condone just as easily swerved into the oncoming lane and killed a family. And you’re praising how you don’t have to pay any money. 

Be glad you’re alive, and that you didn’t kill someone/ruin their life.",Lexus

There’s a similar spec/color FL LS400 near me, and every time we see each other on the road, we wave.

Me too,Lexus
"I would definitely call around more places. While skilled labor and OEM parts come with premium prices these days, it is still a good idea to shop around if it’s not an immediate emergency. If I could drive the car to the shop, that means I can drive it to a second place for a second opinion. My first call to the dealership ended up $450 for rear brake pads. My 2nd call to the local independent mechanic that only fixes Toyota and Lexus quoted me 300, and that is with the re-surfacing included. This was for a 90k mile RX350. The stopping power feels like when I bought the car. I also always ask if OEM parts were used, and double check the part number on the receipt if I could.",Lexus

I would then buy a strut bar for the front 2 struts then see if that improves handeling to your satisfaction. Performance you really can’t improve, only thing you can do is if your car isn’t making power it did when new then you should get your intake valves cleaned either by properly cleaning it yourself or at a shop, or try the crc intake valve cleaner and spray that in acording to instructions and use the brake booster vacuum line to spray it in. Worked good on my gs. And change your spark plugs with oem denso plugs if the current ones are old on non denso. Also make sure your air filter is clean and id also probably use a fuel cleaner to make sure the injectors are perfectly clean. To get actual power increase your gonna need to do some serious work that’s crazy expensive and at that point you can just go buy a gs 350 or even better a gs460 and have way better power.",Lexus

Leg room was great, I could see out windshield, but the very top of my head stuck out the top. I had never had a convertible so I thought it was ok so I bought it in Oct 21. I loved it but really only drove it a month before it was too cold and I parked it till spring. In May I got it out and really took it for a drive out on the interstate. I only drove it with the top down. When I got in traffic a rock kicked off another car and missed me but I realized how easy it could have hit me in the head. If it didn't kill me outright it would possibly cause a bad accident. It spooked me and I sold it back to the dealership.",Lexus

Lol, there is no reason to pay that much for a reman when OEM is affordable. Let the shop order the fucking alt and mark it up 15% or whatever, you're still going to be better off. They may not warranty their work if you provide the part, but you only need that warranty if the part fails. If they buy a reman from a parts house, napa/oreilly/whoever will reimburse them for the labor if they need to replace the part. They aren't getting return business with an OEM part, so fuck their warranty pay them straight time to R&R the part, let them sell you a belt so they make SOME parts profit, and call it a day :)

The LS was selling outstandingly well when sedans were more popular than higher roofed vehicles. My guess is that the LS is the least likely to be a passion pick in its segment so the pragmatic folks that initially gravitated toward the reliable and value leading LS are also going to gravitate toward crossovers.,Lexus
So how about ordering the right part??? Hello…,Lexus
How much?,Lexus
Good song choice too been listening to it for a min,Lexus
What a beautiful…. Lady. Congrats man!!!,Lexus
"You are not getting ripped off, you are just getting charged dealer mark up both in labor and parts. Take it to a small garage that charges a reasonabl labor rate.. $75 to $100 depending on location and either buy your own OEM equivalent parts or have the repair shop buy it for you. Parts that reputable shops typically get from their suppliers are generally OEM equivalent, just do mot carry the expensive name. In all the cars I’ve had in my lifetime this has been my MO to save on repairs and it has served me well. Cars I own right now, 2020 GX460 with 36k miles, 2018 Nissan Rogue with 207k miles and 2020 Lexus IS250C with 97k miles. Most recent repair or maintenance cosf… Alternator and Belt replacement in the IS… $325, All brake pads on the IS… $300, dealer wanted about $1100, Alternator in the Rogue $350, Brakes $160, Transmission Service $160, dealer wants $260 for this. My oil changes for mg car with full syntehtic… $65 to $85.",Lexus
I guess just leave the age out next time so people that can’t afford it don’t get butthurt lol. Follow your dreams man!,Lexus
2021 ES are around $32K,Lexus
"The valley plate seal, front suspension arms and brake booster (less common) are the big ticket items on LS460’s. If you can’t do the work yourself, these jobs can easily be many thousands of dollars",Lexus
That's a downgrade. Keep your head up.,Lexus
What if he melted it together with a soldering iron?,Lexus
"One of the worse drivers on the road is a sleepy one. Because you can’t out logic them — I’ve been here before. In my case thank God for a bad alignment because I drifted to the right. I woke up from the number one lane in the number four lane getting pulled over. I had gotten up to 90+. Told the chp the truth. He was nice enough to write it for 70+. Very expensive lesson that day. The adrenaline of the situation took me home safely. Now when I’m sleepy I pull over. And honestly don’t drive sleepy anymore. 

I am so happy OP is safe and not one was badly hurt. That GX is a beast.",Lexus
Most dealers aren’t waiving add ons these days.,Lexus
it's more of a problem in places with a lot of leaves and sap etc. that could get in there and clog things up. some cars just seem more prone. The car i traded for my gs350 was a Infiniti QX50 and they are notorious for the leaking. The major issue was that the body control module is in the foot well on the passenger side and thats where the water like to run to.,Lexus
"Remember the GS breaks are crazy due to you need disk breaks. There might be slight inflation, but it’s high.",Lexus
Wow! Only time my dealer offers a car wash is during a service appointment.  I wish these were free and unlimited.,Lexus
Damm…. That’s nice,Lexus
Congrats welcome to the Best driving car imo. It’s the 15th car I’ve ever owned ( I have the GS450h ) and we also have a GS350 never had a car that made me smile every time I drive it. Great cars! Enjoy buddy!,Lexus
"I have two. One an 06 with 170,000 miles and a 2015 with 112,000. Both are original HV battery.",Lexus
What an upgrade!,Lexus
"DIY. Buy the 3M kit off Amazon and grab your drill. It’ll take you like an hour and they’ll look great. 

As for replacement lenses don’t do it. The Lexus OEM projectors are 10x better than anything from vland, depo , TYC, etc. just get some new HID bulbs and polish your stock units and you’ll be good. Osram nightbreaker are my bulb of choice. ",Lexus
OP saved so much money with his Prius that he was able to afford an LC.,Lexus
FIXD should be $20 with promotion,Lexus

flair says 93,Lexus
Yes.   The plastic is there to reduce noise.    Removing those plastic retainers once in a blue moon has never been a problem for me on either of my Lexus cars.,Lexus
"So many Lexus hybrid customer complaints with AC are due to this stupid default mode.

It's more than just eco mode driving, there's an entirely different eco ac setting in the climate system that defaults on.",Lexus

I park my ‘20 RX 350 F-Sport next to my neighbor’s GV70 and we always argue over who’s looks better lol. Both cares look great. I have never driven the GV70 but I can surely tell you you can’t go wrong with the RX. I love how it rides and handles. And reliability wise, Lexus has an upper hand over Genesis. Let us know what you end up going with. Good luck and happy buying!",Lexus
Hate the plastics,Lexus
"Holy shit thank you man this is great input. I make on average 730 a week(could be 800 something if I decided to go back to working on Saturdays) and I save up pretty well, currently have a 784 credit score, I have no bills or expenses. I’ll check out that car you just recommended for sure.",Lexus
One of the best cars that no one bought,Lexus
Gross. These cars should never be drift buckets. Same with the SCs. I’d probably lower it a little with good quality coilovers and put good quality wheels on but that’s about it. These cars are luxury cruisers so it actually irritates me whenever I see them trashed.,Lexus
"Never seen that color interior, very interesting. Is the seat leather bad?",Lexus
Looks like it is a UX. So the color is Palomino.,Lexus
"Nice.  
I still have my RX 330 with 247k miles on.",Lexus
it scans the eyes ?,Lexus
It reminds me of the Toyota Cressida junkyard. Nothing but Cressidas. Sad to see but I got the parts I need.,Lexus
"Unless you plan to charge it everyday, I would not get the plugin NX or RX. I have the NX 350h, mostly highway driving and I get 37.8 mpg. I thought about the plugin, but it’s heavier vehicle, and unless you plugin it to maximize the battery you’re burning more gasoline.

planning on taking eco drive off next time i get in the car lol,Lexus
"I have a 2005 ES 330. Just shy of 122,000 miles. It was billed an an entry level luxury sports car. The hand stitched leather and wood steering wheel by itself is a work of art. 

Leather and wood throughout the cabin. And a surprisingly quick V-6.

Made in Japan, baby.",Lexus
My 2013 gs350 has a burning smell probably from the Alt and the mechanic wants $1000 for the job. $150 and hour for labor and $450 for the reman’d alt. I’m like ???? It’s not a 3 hour job and a new alt is certainly not $450,Lexus
"I wish I had a garage, but I keep her in a car cover.",Lexus
"Pilkinton makes their own windshields that are rebadged as Lexus glass.  What makes it Lexus are passing stringent quality standards, safety features, etc.  Anything that doesn’t pass inspection isn’t thrown away, but trickles down to Safelite or regular windshield glass.",Lexus
Ever driven in DC?  Those granite sharp curbs are killer,Lexus
Five owners in five years?  I'm sorry but that is hard-pass territory.,Lexus
Running boards look fresh though,Lexus
"Wow. I’m going to get new detailing equipment right now for my LS430. 

I haven’t seen a black interior of the LS400 in a long time. It’s so beautiful. I hope you enjoy it!",Lexus
"Carbon fiber package, aerodynamic activated wing and such, not like… base.  Sorry for the confusion!",Lexus
"Holy shit God was watching because there is no way you would see that and thought the driver survived, glad you are okay, and count your blessings everyday",Lexus
"No, this is Patrick",Lexus
Is that South Dakota plates? Something tells me you’ve never driven that car in the winter. I’m from NYC and the only thing that can kill a Toyota are the winter seasons.,Lexus
Looking good! Nice choice on the wheels! What brand and what size are they?,Lexus
"Yikes
 What was the interest rate?",Lexus
Thats alot of recommendations man thank you so much I’ll check them out,Lexus
Who cares what you’d pay lol. It’s literally the only one for sale. It’s literally take it or leave it lol,Lexus
Thanks man & m520rs. 20inches,Lexus
From Prius to WHODIS 🔥,Lexus
Not factory.  Your guess is as good as mine.,Lexus
"Smoke is most often coolant leaking and evaporating on some hot engine bay surfaces. It’s likely gonna be a coolant tank replace, not a wreck. Dont worry about the smoke.",Lexus
"Wow it's so cheap in the UK.
I own a body shop and have two pdr guys who do my pdr. Both are amazing even with aluminium panels 
£40 for one dent. Or if there's afew small to medium dents they do them all for £80",Lexus
"Heads Up Display

As for the Seats, we have the F sport with the front bucket seats rear captains chairs and they’re both extremely comfortable (done multiple 10+ hr road trips already) but they can’t be something to be sat in before

On the luxury we tested, it’s the same story
The seats were extremely comfortable for both me and my parents.",Lexus
Crazy glue won’t hold. I’ve done repairs with a plastic weld kit but it’s way easier to just get a new part. ,Lexus
"😂 Got rid of my 2007 IS250 last year, loved it to death was just too small. Moved to the GS(2015) and couldn’t be happier.",Lexus
I had a 4 hour drive on interstates. I wold vary the cruise speed occasionally by 10mph.,Lexus

"Nah, it probably depends on Insurance carriers, but I have statefarm and they just go off my vin number. My statefarm office is nearby.",Lexus
That's false,Lexus
In the US a wooden steering wheel implies a hybrid or Ultra Luxury (fully loaded) I believe,Lexus
Should be the top comment,Lexus
That's the thing. You better know what you're ordering  haha,Lexus
Welcome to the family!,Lexus
"I have a is350 sport and my girl has a es350 big differences in both the es is definitely a more comfortable drive smoother more relaxing while I use my is to zip around and deff a stiffer suspension, the is has staggered wheels and the es comes on both fwd and awd, the es is deff way more roomier and inmy experience way cheaper then the is maintaining them is pretty much the same shit but I haven't changed the wheels on the is or es yet but I'm assuming cause the is is low profile wheels that they will be more expensive then the es tires, brakes haven't done either but I'm imagining that es brakes are cheaper since the is is the sport package. Feel free to reach out with questions",Lexus
Congratulations! Welcome to the TX family!,Lexus
This looks fantastic. Congrats!,Lexus
"This is the kinda car I am angling for.. facelift 460 5 seat executive (or ""rear seat upgrade"" as its called in US/CA). Good to see that they are making it to 240,000km",Lexus
I took mine off to help with “air flow and cooling” I don’t know how much of a difference removing the plastic makes but I live in AZ and let’s just say it gets a little bit hot in the summer. Gotta keep the big oh V8 coo!,Lexus
