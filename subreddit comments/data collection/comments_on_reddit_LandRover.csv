"My mistake, I conflated the dealer with your local Rover tech",LandRover
There you have it. Try again in a month.,LandRover
Pm me I can perhaps find you one and rebuild the motor.,LandRover
Any place better or worse? Did they let you use your own shop? What kind of repairs did you encounter?,LandRover
I always thought that the new discovery had been branded as a defender,LandRover
Sweet man. What mileage did you get your LR4 and what is at now? What repairs did you have to do?,LandRover
"Its not a hard swap and the 6 pot is a piece of shit that drink petrol . With a weber carb u can get 16 to 17 mpg 
And 12 with the old junky zenith carb 

A tdi work a treat with disco 1 diffs 

Pretty sure the tdi has same bellhouse bolt patern . 
But it may need a 4 pot  bellhousing . Its been many years since i was doing these conversions and we would put ford Essex  v6 in with a steve parker conversion plate . 

The info u seek with be on the forums . Redit or fb groups  are full of idiots . Get on the lro forums and the ozzy one . 

Hreat old bus . Power steering should be high on your list to do .  We use to use a 3 bolt rangrover box as they were plentyfull but they all have same fitting 3 4 and 6bolt . Some fab needed .",LandRover
"There is a lot of misinformation surrounding ZF transmissions, mainly because most shops and transmission experts won‚Äôt touch them unless they came out of a ford. The weak point of the ZF is definitely the valve body and associated seals.",LandRover
Thank you didn‚Äôt buy it,LandRover
"I would absolutely agree to a quote for 13,000 yen if the quality was up to snuff.",LandRover
The new Defender should have been six.,LandRover
I opened this expecting massive front end damage from an lr2 dropped off of a lift.  Glad this isn't that.,LandRover
Agreed,LandRover
"I think a lease would be silly in your case. If you are going to stroke a check, might has well just keep the thing for 3 years and sell it on your own after that, no interest payed out. Alternatively, if you finance it, can you make more money than the interest rate with that money?

As far as unexpected costs, the car will be under warranty for 4years/50k miles. Only thing you are on the hook for is the consumables. If you choose to keep the truck, you can buy an extended warranty *before* the factory warranty expires.

So far, that straight six is proving to be a very solid motor.

Rover have similar or less PITAness compared to the Germans. I wouldnt worry about it coming from BMW/AUDI ownership. Only time I ""gate keep"" people from a Rover is if they're used to maintaining a 98 Corolla and think the $200 bucks they spent on pads an rotors that one time was a lot (True story)",LandRover
"Considering I was quoted 5k for new headlight assembly (mine yellowed - just buffed them instead), something tells me you‚Äôre not being reamed *that badly*",LandRover
"I don't like the newer cars, modern engines are too delicate (especially in the EU, with all the environmental regulations. Euro6 diesels with Adblue have so many issues), there are too many driving assistants (that I find noisy, intrusive and unreliable), infotainment can't keep up with new technologies (development cycles in car industry are much longer than mobile industry so products are obsolete as soon as they are released, I just use my phone for everything and don't need more than an AUX connector). For me the peak in the car industry was in the years 2010-2015, and cars from that time can still be found with a reasonable mileage. I hope my 2012 Discovery 4 will last many many years because I don't want a D5 and there isn't much competition (considering I need 7 seats daily).",LandRover
"Man, a 101FC is my final bucket list Land Rover.  I have been looking for one for many many years.

Enjoy it!",LandRover
Probably some old merchandise that was sold through dealerships. They have a lot of weird gear and clothes and knickknacks that they will have made up and sold through dealer parts departments but usually in limited quantities. If it's official it may have a part# on it somewhere.,LandRover
"apologies! moving to the correct sub, missed the pinned post.",LandRover
"It‚Äôs missing a ‚Äòif you can read this, please turn me over‚Äô sticker, because those are the peak of class.",LandRover
that isnt the case. I havent even looked at the car yet. Nor has he seen mine. Purely my own opinion and opinion of local land rover guy i do maintenance with. Nothing to do with dealer to be clear. The trade ins definitely help the deal and im sure he;ll make money on both tbh.,LandRover
Looks shit. Typical Chinese products,LandRover
The AJ engine in the Defender is a much better engine than the BMW crap LR is forced to use for now.,LandRover
Series 3?,LandRover
Already have a hilux. I like how the lr4 drove better.,LandRover
Dime a dozen in So Cal. It's a very pretty color.,LandRover
I checked with multiple service centres and they estimated from 1000-1800.,LandRover
"Pretty much every V8 into a Series results in chopping the tunnel/footwell, the six is not unique in that, but it's not a massive deal and at least you end up with a vehicle that still sounds good and drives smoothly and in a relaxed fashion.

No need for a Defender front end (that would be an abomination unto the lord), you can fit it in easily enough, or for extra room you can move the radiator further forward in the front panel & trim the back of it down, there's a good 6"" of fresh air in front of the radiator. People have fitted V8 + 5spd and LT230 into Series 1 80"" a hundred years ago, it's not rocket surgery.

Air filter use whatever fits, the round ones from the TDi's are actually a good option.",LandRover
Oh no,LandRover
Look at the price on this one. üò¶[LR3 used](https://www.bocadrive.com/details/used-2008-land-rover-lr3/101517914),LandRover
Exactly !,LandRover
"American created and owned. Constructed on Chinese soil by an American company to American standards. Buy a Chinese iPhone‚Ä¶ it won‚Äôt have the quality. 

That‚Äôs a Chinese car created to Chinese standards.",LandRover
"Sounds like the exact kind of ""$1000-est"" LR3 I aspire to own lol.",LandRover
Series III had plastic grills.,LandRover
Really? I think it looks like 5 different knock-off Chinese SUV's glommed into one. Not as clean & functional as an OE Defender or G-Wagen but still very ugly especially the front.,LandRover
"Auto and 300TDI is an odd combination, rust they rust check that out thoroughly before sinking any more money into it.",LandRover
"I live in India and there only one option that's is P460e and I do long trips I have another car for city this will be for my long trips, and at this price point there on other competing it BMW X7 and MERC GLS are way less cheaper than this but they have so much of boy roll that's why l'm considering Sport and there is rule also in India that diesel model will be valid for only 10 years and petrol for 15 years and everyone wants a decent resell value",LandRover
Thats a dead port. If you stick you finger in there you'll see that its blocked. On other vehicles its used for something. On the LR2 the sound generator was not needed,LandRover
"2010 original owner here. I changed the oil about every 7500 miles and got the timing chain code at 112,000 miles. But what has really been a bear this last 12 months is the cooling system leaks. I have had just about every single part of it replaced now. The plastic bits just wear out. I don't do the work myself either, which is a shame.

&#x200B;

As for electrical - absolutely problem free since the start.",LandRover
"you can buy a 2013 v8 lr4 with 23k miles on it for 24k, the cost they were talking about for a engine rebuild",LandRover
appreciate it. I never considered how good sunrises would look with all the sun/moon roofs. Really more into the mattress now than a rtt,LandRover
"No issues with my p400 SE, just random buttons don‚Äôt work sometimes that‚Äôs it lol. The p400 has a bmw engine I believe",LandRover
It‚Äôs a iones grenadier  fieldmaster.,LandRover
Bouncing off rocks like that always makes me feel sorry for the drivetrain.,LandRover
"Caught that before it got bad. New compressor and blew the lines clean as a whistle. I had a feeling so I'm glad I did this. Thanks for solidifying that. I felt so bad for spending that much lol 

What's this Atlantic British app? Is it like a diagnosis app?",LandRover
Was always under the impression the 5 was just a generation. 2017 Discovery HSE,LandRover
"It's super nice, but will it ever get to play in the dirt properly, like it's defender bredren?",LandRover
"Get one with air suspension. It's a big part of the terrain response system if you want to go off-roading. The air suspension isn't very complex, it usually only fails on one of two components: the air springs or the valve block. While parts aren't the cheapest around, it is not the difficult to repair.

If this Discovery 3 will be used mostly for on road use I wouldn't even consider a lifted Discovery. The lift will only bring disadvantages when driving around town.",LandRover
"It looks very nice. BaT does seem your best bet. $45k would be top money for a ‚Äò94.  The only trucks selling over $30k on BaT in the last year are restored 1995s, 2-Doors, or rare 2dr convertibles.",LandRover
"Yeah for me other then weird Land Rover problems: 
- the hood latch not working 
- leaking windscreen 
- broken door locks 
- broken seat motors 
- broken mirror motor
- tpms errors
- exhaust faults 
- dead battery ( more then once ) 
- software issues causing the Bluetooth to fail 

It‚Äôs been good. I‚Äôve owned 4 Land Rover discovery‚Äôs and this is by far the most reliable. 

It‚Äôs also great in the mud and fine on fuel ( I get just under 850km per tank mixed driving )",LandRover
"And pay for the 5-7k mile oil changes. It's a 6 digit car,  don't neglect it with their 21k mile intervals.",LandRover
"Ah that makes more sense, are there no independent shops near you? It would probably cut the estimate in half almost",LandRover
"Thanks. Maybe I can use that for next time. I just had surgery and currently can‚Äôt lift over 5lbs, but dashboard says next oil change 0 miles.",LandRover
"Yea that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking here first before I buy the part lol. Thanks for the info. 

EBay is wild for the amount of people trying to sell you a fake part or claiming it‚Äôs genuine",LandRover
RRS,LandRover
"Yes. I am ordering the pedal commander and report back if it actually changes the lag or if it just artificially shortens the pedal throw.

Very sick of being gaslit by people who‚Äôve never experienced a car with reasonable throttle response saying theres no issue with the LR3 or that it must be a problem with mine. Ive driven several L319 and L320, they all completely suck in terms of throttle lag.",LandRover
Yeah looks like the new Hyundai Santa Fe.,LandRover
"The exit angles of the 3/4 look better than the 2 and about same as 1 which is highly regarded. Plus, these aren‚Äôt with the suspension raised which gives it even more room. I have both a D1 (1997) and an LR3.",LandRover
3rd gear is generally the limp mode gear. A valve body might be a good move. Honestly fluid condition is going to be a good indicator of what‚Äôs going on in the transmission.,LandRover
Ah I get you now. Cheers,LandRover
AAA,LandRover
I think Throttle House [said it best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etqrW21LG6o)...,LandRover
"Read my post. Everything you mentioned has been done. My truck is perfectly maintained. Everything about the air and fuel delivery systems are either new or recently serviced and it has always been this way. The issue isn‚Äôt a lazy response that you‚Äôd see from bad injectors or a dirty throttle body or Maf, its a laggy response, meaning the ECU isn‚Äôt even attempting to open the throttle despite the pedal being pressed",LandRover
I had this on mine. It was the caliper. Swapped the two rears and it went away. Never came back in 2-3yrs,LandRover
"The TDV6 can be difficult to start in colder weather due to how it attempts to start. When you try to start the car won't wait for the glow plugs to do their job, it just cranks while the glow plugs come one, trying to compensate with the fuel/air mixture. While the idea is nice in theory, it means the TDV6 isn't a fan of the cold. 

You could try and test the glow plugs to begin with. Testing the glowplugs is easy on the TDV6 as the 2 multi plugs sit on the top of the engine either side of the oil filter. Should any of them have failed, then comes the difficult part of the job. Changing the glow plugs on a Ford Lion diesel is no small task. Usually they're pretty entrenched and trying to screw them out will often result in one breaking off.",LandRover
Very helpful info. I‚Äôll give it a shot once I get it to start again.,LandRover
"I just got me an education - thanks!! 

The historic status is a real consideration.",LandRover
"These sometimes suffered with the brake booster failing and letting oil into the booster itself. 

Open the bonnet, and get someone to either brake the brake all the way whilst the other is listening to the brake booster, it you hear a gurgling noise then it's done for and needs replacing.

There's also a rubbing grommet on top of it which you can stick a cable tie down to see if there's any oil down there.",LandRover
Prob needs a fuel pump.   Is it an LR4 or older RRS?  Usually doesn‚Äôt have any drivability issues but could.,LandRover
Very tidy looking Series 2 109‚Äù long wheel base,LandRover
"We drive NJ->VT every weekend to ski, so buttloads of miles.   I regularly tow a trailer hitch full of gear since I have 3 kids, also a 24‚Äô CC.  I do all the maintenance- so whatever it needs gets done.  Regular oil is most important.   My skid plate was cut to make oil changes a bit easier‚Ä¶",LandRover
"Holy shit, why would anybody pay that for a lease? Simply insane.",LandRover
Id look so cool in that,LandRover
In what way do the belts drive you nuts?,LandRover
Yess brother u can buy and enjoy the defender experience! I was a BMW fan I had only BMW in my life but after I drove a defender it‚Äôs another level,LandRover
"So I‚Äôm pretty much sold on the idea of the Range Rover Sport.  Just read a horror story where a dude bought a 2014 LR. Within a year, the engine locked up.  $20K for an engine. 6 months later, his transmission blew. $7K for a new transmission.  $27K in repairs. I know it‚Äôs not likely, but I don‚Äôt want that to be me.",LandRover
Nah mate.  It drives absolutely nothing like the new defender    The grenadier is a rough no frills back breaker    I suppose it depends what folks want really.  Old school or cutting edge,LandRover
Any Mongoose/ Mangoose cable to recommend?,LandRover
I‚Äôd recommend the same-choose a different dealer. I went in circles on the phone with the San Antonio Rover salesman and I just eventually bought from the Houston LR dealership.,LandRover

üòÜ,LandRover
"Watch Croker Vs Rover on youtube, he's doing a very similar Discovery right now although his is V8.

300TDi is a decent engine, behind an auto it's not going to win any races. Give it a damn good service, change ALL the fluids & grease everything and see where you are.

All the factory manuals & parts books are online as free PDF's, also recommend LR4x4 forum for technical stuff.",LandRover
Insurance ppl are hot on my tail!,LandRover
Declined. Over limit. What now?,LandRover
Damn I wish I did,LandRover
The real flex would be showing off the 101FC ;),LandRover
This is a joke right?,LandRover
Perfection. Happy Birthday!,LandRover
It‚Äôs all related to supply and demand and of course the labor involved,LandRover
bummer. hope you can get this back on the road!!!,LandRover

Can we introduce a vehicle that works without any data connection? I am very wary of putting financial capability/ details in any electronic device especially anything that may no longer be supported security wise in 5-6 years and something that may be on sold to a complete stranger in a few years. How would you ensure the data is removed?,LandRover
Other than this issue how was it treated you in terms of reliability so far?,LandRover
So keep filling it until I can find someone who WANTS to work on it?,LandRover
"Step 1: uninstall sloth from throttle body.

Yep and you can have the frame painted whatever color you like at the dealership,LandRover
You weren‚Äôt kidding. The prices on the 3s are definitely my scene.,LandRover
"My train of thought is:

It's ticketable offense here/Canada (probably not where the photo is from). 

If the snow were to freeze into a sheet and depart the vehicle  on a highway, the driver would be liable for damages caused to any vehicle that was hit.

Usually drivers for company vehicles here need a spotless driver's abstract, so doing tests like this in public seems counterintuitive.",LandRover

"Yearly repair costs vary greatly depending on age and the model. 

My two Discovery IIs always required extra work to pass MoT. Quality control at Land Rover wasn't the best back then and it showed from time to time. I always budgeted some ¬£1500 for extra work that would need doing like welding. Some years I didn't need to spend so much other years, well... One of my Discovery IIs blew it's ACE system and let me tell you that is a rather expensive piece of kit. 

On the other hand my Freelander 2 was very easy, it never needed something extra doing. The only expensive service it needed was the one where they change the timing belt and water pump, however I could fully plan and prepare for this.

As for my Discovery Sport it's too early to tell yet.

With an older Land Rover I'd say just put a few thousand aside in a Land Rover Rainy Day fund. If you encounter a big repair bill you can use the money to pay it and afterwards you'll top your fund back up.",LandRover

Another upside of using the IID BT is that it comes with free updates for life for the home version.

"The obvious cause might be either the ultrasonic sensor in the DPF reservoir can't get a good measurement or the quality of the AdBlue is bad or there is a problem with the AdBlue injector.

The ultrasonic sensor in the AdBlue reservoir can either fail or if the reservoir has been overfilled it will return a bad reading. When topping up the AdBlue it is best not to top it up all the way because of this very problem. 

The AdBlue could have gone bad, this not uncommon as many service stations store these little tanks outside in conditions which are not suitable for storing AdBlue. If exposed to direct sunlight or too high temperatures the AdBlue will degrade and become useless. While you drive the car measures the before and after of the exhaust, if the NOx reduction was not sufficient you can get this error too. Spoiled AdBlue can cause this. Another possibility is that the AdBlue injector is clogged up. The injector lives just before the DPF, but because it sits in the exhaust it gets dirty and blocked up at times. It's a simple job to remove it and give it a good clean with a pick and some brake cleaner.",LandRover

"If you buy a 2024 Defender it will come with a 5 year/90-ish thousand miles warranty. So for the first five years of ownership you're covered. 

Keep in mind that the first five years of a new car are the easiest years by far, it's only after five years you'll run into bigger service items like say timing belts (although New Defender has a timing chain) and after seven years you'll be seeing the first wear and tear items pop up. For any leasing company this is easy money, they only have to pay for one service in the three years you'll be leasing it and afterwards they can sell the car. Anything major that breaks is most likely covered by the factory warranty, so they don't have to budget for it.",LandRover

Depends on how long you plan on keeping it. I wouldn‚Äôt own any LR outside of its warranty. Talking from experience here as well.,LandRover
"From my personal experience I was torn between the two and in the end I picked the lr4 because I like the peppier engine and the more updated interior. I have had this for over a year and so far I am in love with it. With that being said I have had to do a TON of maintenance that was neglected from the previous owners. Just to give you an idea I paid $11,500 for a 2012 black LR4 HSE which at the time had just over 102,000 on the odometer. Here is everything I have done to it:

Mainly, cooling system issues - water pump, etc. The vehicles have plastic coolant pipes in front of and behind the engine which can fail and I think the thermostat is in a weird location so doesn't sense overheat super well (??? Someone correct me??).

So if you notice a leak from them please address them before they completely fail and fry the engine. Or you can replace in advance. I think they can start to be at risk generally 80-100k (again someone correct me). I have heard the timing chains can skip too, even with the strengthening of components vs. prior model years.

Just find an indy LR mechanic you trust and have them look it over. And yes, the car will reward you if you keep up with strict maintenance. These are too nice of a vehicle to ignore maintenance.",LandRover

100% of the time it is a low pressure fuel pump. Dont waste time clearing no point. There was a BS TSB to do a pcm update.

"Sure but you're considering the forces applied to either side of the centerline axis.  It's the inverted pendulum problem; you need a restoring force to bring the system back to equilibrium.  The weight of the trailer matters because that figures into the moment of inertia and the magnitude of the force required.  Number of axles on the trailer, and the center of mass of the system matters as well -- thus paying attention to the tongue weight with respect to payload being a big factor.

"Duuuude please don't stick a 20 year old TDi in that beauty, no good can come of it.

The 2.6 is not an efficient engine (but nothing from that era was) but in good fettle they are lovely things to drive and they sound great (and they're rare), failing that there's surely domestic engine swaps that would be better / more practical.

The 2.6 does not interchange with any other LR lumps so unlike (say) a 2.25 diesel you can't bolt up a 200 or 300 to that gearbox - so any engine swap is also likely a gearbox swap.

LR engines were always de-tuned for poor fuel etc so the 2.6 might have some potential, there used to be performance heads and the like a long time ago.

Don't rule out a V8 swap, a fuel injected V8 from a range rover will give a power boost and potentially an MPG boost too, not as great as a TDi but you could see 20mpg+ driven sensibly, and a much nicer drive than the tdi.

The 6cyl should already have the larger Stage 1 V8 brakes so that's a bonus.

"2021 Velar here (wife's). My hot takes, thus far. Probably a bit off-kilter from what you're looking for, but hope there's some relevance.

- JLR's connected services, as they exist do not seem on par with the industry, in general. I have friends with Kias that present far superior and more robust offerings.
- Remote Start - works most of the time, but not all of the time. The wake up function isn't user friendly - there is a wakeup timer, but it's hard to understand and quite honestly, seems poorly implemented unlike Mercedes which allows the vehicle to ""go to sleep"" and then wake up/remote start at any time, or at least it did on our MY19
- Second part to this is would like to see improved notifications on unlock, start, etc. other vehicles provide these notifications always whereas (it appears) they can only be configured for a short duration 
- Battery drain - RR is the only connected vehicle we've owned where if you don't drive the vehicle for a minimum of some time occasionally, the vehicle presents a low battery warning and needs a battery tender. And In our experience, I'm talking not driven in days (like, less than 10) not weeks. Out outgoing Mercedes (MY17 & 19) both allowed us to remote start any any time, no matter what. When I was working out of state for months at a time, I could start the car and let it run for 10 minutes without issue.
- The OTA software update feature seems to work without issue
- Wireless Car Play/Android Auto is good and appears more stable than using it wired, in our experience
- Agree with others that a way to globally manage/disable the wake up features would be nice, like everything comes one when you open the door. This became a circular problem when needing to maintain the battery during ""low battery"" warning time. Non-specific to JKR, but would be great if auto manufacturers started integrating magnetic battery tender ports standard, especially as more and more computers, TCUs, and connected systems are used.",LandRover

"So there is no objective metric for desierability however you can get an faux metric by comparing to sales with similar brands, sales numbers (compare to production capacity),  customer retention, subjective satisfaction, and buy-again polls. The only thing you can get close to is a consumer reports survey, which are known to be problematic (they never align with repair numbers as they are subjective surveys. Look at how they report Chrysler and Jeep products)

Land Rover has never scored the highest on any of those except retention, and if you ask in any car sub most people will tell you they would never but them. Don't confuse bad supply with desieranility and don't be dillusional. 

If you want a numeric value I'll do it when I get home. You are arguing against someone with a masters in data analytics and cyber security. This is a 5 minute toilet break kind of faux metric to calculate.

"My experience with the LR3 is limited to a test drive for comparison sake, but the LR4 feels noticeably newer and faster. My advice would be to worry less about mileage and find an LR4 that‚Äôs already had a chain job. These engines are reliable when maintained and the Achilles heels (timing chain tensioners and cooling system/crossover pipes) are preventatively maintained, which isn‚Äôt cheap. 

Join the LR4 Facebook groups and wait for an enthusiast to post one for sale that has good service records.

"Congrats on the new to you Discovery Sport. With the HSE Luxury trim your Discovery Sport should feature pretty much all the toys it could have. The best feature to have if is it has the 10 inch touchscreen with InControl Touch Pro instead of the smaller 8 inch screen. ICTP offers more modern features like Apple Carplay or Android Auto. 

If you want to see how the Discovery Sport looks with more black pieces of trim you can google either for ""black pack"" or ""dynamic"". Both were options that added black pieces of trim. My Discovery Sport is in the HSE Dynamic trim, so it has the gloss black grille and the plastic bits of trim that look like side vents are also in gloss black. The lettering on the bonnet and boot is also in a sort of gloss black. My Discovery Sport is in Corris Grey with the contrasting black roof, the alloys are in a dark grey. The whole package looks very smart because the darker grey fits well with the gloss black.

Land Rover offered two engines with that kind of power output, the D240 (diesel) and the P240 (petrol). Both are rare, at least in the UK and EU. The petrol engine is rare because it's very thirsty, the D240 is rare for the same reason. Most people would have opted for the D180 since it offers a good combination of more power, but retaining decent fuel economy. I wouldn't bother with re-mapping either engine. Neither will feel slow to begin with, so a re-map really doesn't offer that much. Personally I would enjoy the engine as it is.",LandRover

"> but I think the trim levels of each, the 360 degree is included as standard.

You'd be surprised how often they lack the 360 camera. Especially vehicles made in the 2020-2021 period lack a lot of tech because of the semiconductor shortages back then. Better check to make sure they have this option if you want it.

> my understanding was that anything labelled ‚ÄúD300‚Äù was the ingenium diesel

No. Land Rover has a habit of sticking new badges on old engines. The straight six Ingenium diesel was available in the L494 Range Rover Sport from september 2021 onwards. If this Range Rover was built before that time it's still the old Ford Lion diesel. 

> is it decent enough, when paired with mostly using Apple Car Play anyway?

Yes it is. Like I said my Discovery Sport has ICTP fitted too. I barely use it since I just plug in my phone and it does all the work through Apple Carplay. My phone does everything from satnav to streaming music. I only switch back to ICTP if I need something like the 4x4i menu. 

The ICTP satnav is fine, it's not any worse compared to other systems. Land Rover still sells updates for the maps if you want them. The updates also include a years worth of free updates, so if they publish a new map you can download it straight away. Still, I use my phone since Apple Maps is free and always updated.

My biggest complaint with ICTP would be that the interface is kinda sluggish. If you swipe through a menu or the apps there a bit of lag. First world problems I suppose. Boot up times used to be atrocious but they fixed this with updates. Now ICTP boots when you open the car, so when you press the button to start the system is ready to go.

Land Rover never says for how long they'll support an infotainment system. They just drop it at some point, but they never announce it. This is why I'm wondering what they are going to do with ICTP. Yearly updates to the software is fine, but we didn't get an update in 2023.",LandRover

"This engine is still very new, but I haven't heard anything bad about it. If you are looking at petrol engines, you could also consider the PHEV versions. The P440e or P510e is a great option too. You still get the same straight six petrol engine, but it's mated to an electric motor. It can drive a very decent amount of miles in full EV mode, even at motorway speeds. If you do a lot of city driving it will help save a lot of fuel. The only caveat being that you have to be able to charge it.

"Tapa motors out of LA. I'm in Indiana so there was a shipping charge, core charge, but my shop took care of that.

And everything else was upgraded from heavy duty to extra heavy duty. I have been really eased with it. My only worry is having an accident and not getting my money out of it. But my reasoning was I could spend $20k on another vehicle that wasn't as nice as my rover, or I could spend it and get an easy 10 years out of it.",LandRover
"So I ran into the same issue.  Can you shift the gears up and down using sport mode before it goes into limp mode when you start the car?  If you had a obdi 2 scanner reader like Gap or AB you can clear the fault and reset adaption. Hopefully, it will work. 

So If you can shift up and down. Then it's  the  solenoid.  These ZF are super resilient and normally solenoids replacement and tranny fluid/filter change will solve the issue.  The solenoids are particularly sensitive to heat cause of the heat transfer from coolant degrading or a leak  or dirty oil.   

I had a tranny oil leak and let didn't  fix it. The few solenoids got over heated and went out. Plus I never changed the oil.  I found a tranny specialist and bought the solenoids pack, fluids and filter and he replaced the rest.

Just an fyi I would personally avoid the 5.0 motor and that age range if you aren‚Äôt already very very mechanically savvy and ready to bury into user forums all weekend.

The XZL has always seemed like a nice enough tyre, and I was given to understand that's a minor evolution of the XCL.

Particularly annoying as I have three nearly new ones, but obtaining two more that aren't in worse condition than the two I'm retiring is proving impossible.




>Lots of people fitted the longer military spring shackles to gain a bit of height for very little effort, that may be enough - I would ask on LR4x4.com forum as there's lots of Series on there and definitely a few running 9.00x16's.


I'm a bit leery of fitting extended shackles without the associated dumb iron and outrigger modifications.


I had a bad experience with extended shackles on the Hilux (where they made the rear end brutally harsh, which messed with on-road handling).


>You shouldn't need to modify any crossmembers or fit new propshafts unless you're doing really twisty off-road work.


Reading old threads on the various forums, different people seemed to have somewhat different experiences of this.


Some having no issue at all whilst others with the same lift found the rear prop rubbed on the cross member behind the transmission brake, even on the flat.


In any case I don't think I would really gain any benefit from a suspension lift, the stock axle articulation is more than enough for anything I'm likely to have the bottle to drive it over, and the longest springs in world won't give better diff clearance, which is where I'm more likely to come unstuck.

"For the longest time I‚Äôd been dead set on a defender, I even had a new P400e on order at the end of 2022, which having ordered on a 12 month lead, then with 4 weeks notice was told it was going to arrive within 3 months or order, which didn‚Äôt suit me at the time! Fast forward a year, and having seen what‚Äôs happened to PHEV/ EV‚Äôs, and the potential of it dropping range year on year, I decided that the D300‚Äôwas the one for me, but more recently, I‚Äôve seen the values of the RR‚Äôs drop to a point where they are very very good value I think, and for the longer drives, which I‚Äôll be doing, they offer an added layer of comfort.

"Helpful. I suppose I should make a list of things for Land Rover to check. Does it not feel a little r stupid that they cannot figure out this problem? They built the car, they have the best tools. What am I missing?",LandRover
"Thanks for putting that all together, very informative.

I‚Äôve test driven a D250 110 defender, and your right, very large imposing vehicle, didn‚Äôt take on any country lanes, nor would it be on a regular basis, but the manoeuvrability is definitely something to consider. But the size, for the longer trips is definitely a plus. I could be wrong, but I think the trim levels of each, the 360 degree is included as standard.

On the engine, my understanding was that anything labelled ‚ÄúD300‚Äù was the ingenium diesel, as opposed to the previous Ford, I maybe wrong, but I also read that MY21 RR sport onwards was available with the new engine, this is definitely something I would check though In any case, I‚Äôve read and seen plenty of negative press about the Ford engines, and am definitely looking to avoid in any case. 

With ICTP vs Pivi Pro, I do mostly use Apple Car play in the cars I run now, as with all operating systems they‚Äôll likely be supersceded within a few years, do you have any idea on how long JLR intends to support current Gen? And with ICTP do you think it now lacks due not continued support, and is there still going to be map updates? Obviously it‚Äôs not going to be as good as pivi pro, but in isolation is it decent enough, when paired with mostly using Apple Car Play anyway?

I sort of knew the short trip part, as with all larger diesels, but thought it was worth to mention, I think I‚Äôll likely keep running my other car for the commute, just wanted to see if there was any differing opinions on it.

The Grenadier is aimed at a very niche audience of people who yearn for the old Defender whilst shouting that the new Land Rovers aren't Land Rovers at all. It doesn't have to be people who say this about Land Rover, most modern 4x4s get this kind of criticism. It's a very small crowd to begin with at any rate.

The Grenadier not only copied the look from the old Defender, it also copied the horrible ride and poor ergonomics it had. It's this weird mash-up of modern tech (Euro 6 engine, automatic transmission) with some retro stuff which is primarily the live axles and the rollerball steering. This is the thing with modern off-roaders like New Defender or any other for that matter, these vehicles show us that you can have the best of both worlds. An off-roader that is comfortable on-road and has car-like roadmanners, but is equally capable when going off-road. In the past you could only pick one and had to suffer the other, but now you get both in a single package and that is what I call evolution. Wanting to go back to those old days is somewhat being a Luddite.

There is also the matter of pricing. The Grenadier is quite expensive, with a ¬£60K plus price tag it's up there with New Defender. It's not the vision of a working man 4x4 with that kind of prices. Neither was old Defender in the end, so perhaps the Grenadier also copied that bit.

The utility 4x4 market is dead, at least to Land Rover. The only way to be a player in that market is if you can churn out a high volume of cheap and low spec vehicles. Since the 1980s this market has been dominated by Asian carmakers. Cars like the Nissan Navara, Isuzu Dmax and Toyota Hilux reign supreme here. Land Rover can't match this and they knew it, so they moved to greener pastures. If they didn't they'd be right up there with Rover and the rest of the British car industry.",LandRover

"IID BT from GAP Diagnostics. There is no substitute, save for having access to Topix Cloud. 

A word of caution however: do not force a DPF regeneration. If you have DPF problems you need to find out why. Just forcing a regeneration if it's full can even ruin your DPF. If there is too much soot in the DPF it won't burn off, but the temperature will rise and it might damage the DPF itself. If your DPF is full it's better to have it cleaned and afterwards tell the car it has had a new DPF.

Since you had problems with your AdBlue your Discovery will also have stopped any kind of active DPF regeneration because of this. So your DPF might be full or near full. If the AdBlue problem is resolved and your DPF isn't clogged, just take your Discovery for a long drive somewhere. The car will sense the DPF is full and regenerate it. If it can't do so, get someone to clean your DPF. Do not force a regeneration.",LandRover

This is VERY helpful! üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª,LandRover
Deka batteries were pretty solid for awhile. I‚Äôve heard they slipped in quality but still pretty up there. Otherwise interstate is in most of my rigs. AGM is a must.,LandRover
"I had it done. I‚Äôm forgetting the name of the company. Maybe Radio1 or something. But I had to send in my whole radio to them and they put it in. However, eventually I just replaced the whole head unit with one that had a large screen and CarPlay. Worth every penny.",LandRover
"Thanks for the comprehensive response. It‚Äôs funny because we‚Äôve both always had cars with some buttons ‚Äòblanked‚Äô off, features that we just couldn‚Äôt afford. Finally there‚Äôs not a single piece of tech missing, I‚Äôve got to say I‚Äôm pretty astounded with some of the features such as the drivers chair lowering a bit to help you in and out, not that we need it we‚Äôre only 32 but it‚Äôs just brilliant. 

I‚Äôll check out the black and dynamic models. Yeah I‚Äôm just a little worried that if I changed her front grille and the wheels got sprayed black it still wouldn‚Äôt have the trimmings. I wonder if the trimmings etc are easy to swap out without breaking anything‚Ä¶ well, not my car so I‚Äôll just do what she wants haha but if it was mine I‚Äôd be making some slight visual modifications, it‚Äôs a lovely car and something to be proud of for sure.

Question for you, does it have an app or anything that she can maybe use to lock/ unlock the car? Check location and maybe even heat it up on a winters morning? I did see an app but she won‚Äôt download it unless I have answers lol I‚Äôm doing all the homework for her.",LandRover

"I'd pick LR3 over LR4 just for the reliability standpoint. It's no secret the 5.0 engines are not great long term. But if you're okay with dumping money into them for coolant pipes and timing chains and whatnot then go ahead. Also any LR4 for 12k will definitely need a lot of deferred maintenance. Make sure that regardless of which one you pick, buy the nicest one you can afford¬†",LandRover
how can you tell what the intake side or exhaust side is? Im not knowledgeable on this,LandRover
"I like it - good car - not perfect but fast, practical & capable‚Ä¶..",LandRover
I drove an LR3 with air and converted to springs before I bought mine.  The air ride was so much better IMO. I‚Äôve taken mine on many trail rides and don‚Äôt regret the decision. With that said I don‚Äôt think a converted suspension is a bad thing and like ourdoorszy said you would just be sacrificing a bit of ride comfort.  Give them both a test drive if you can.  It‚Äôll just come down to your preference.,LandRover
Didn't hear a clicking but sounds normal to me. I'm no expert tho... Take it to a independent rover shop and ask,LandRover
"Yes, you can download the InControl app to monitor your Discovery Sport. However the options you have in the app are limited by what features are fitted to the vehicle and your subscription level. The basic free tier just allows you to see if your car is locked, how much fuel it has etc.. Remote climate has to be fitted to the car, if your touchscreen shows an option for the climate timings you have this feature available to you.

As for  the black trim, you can just buy these from Land Rover and fit them. It's just a matter of clicking them into place. It's an easy job to do. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnAI4wetOCI) you can see how to swap the grille.

Some of this applies to you. The SCV6 and the SCV8 are essentially the same thing. 

Stay up on maintenance. Use the proper oil and filter etc.",LandRover
The v8 are solid engines. The only issues are the bushings in the suspension go bad. EPB fail. Coolant thermostat housing leak. But it's a work horse and won't let you down.,LandRover
They definitely are. Although I don‚Äôt care much for any of them after the 2013 Sport. That boxy body style is my favorite. And their reliability is directly related to preventative maintenance.,LandRover

"I'm about halfway up and on the other side of the state from you, unfortunetly.",LandRover
I would keep the air suspension. They‚Äôre a lot more reliable and more durable than people make it out to be. It‚Äôs not unheard of for some LR3s to still have the original air struts (like the rear ones on mine). Maintenance and repairs are not that difficult too especially with the Gap IID.,LandRover
i like how they are making new models yet their windshields are still on backorder lol,LandRover
"I drive a 2012 HSE that I purchased from family with a good record.  It needed about 5k expected on purchase.  Brakes, control arms, tires, and a few other things.  Only 80k when purchased.  Now at 90 doing well.   Other then the gremlins.  What are gremlins?   Well they live in the vehicle and are mostly great.  But occasionally they like to bring out the Christmas lights.  The dash say no cruise control then disappears.  Dash says tailgate sometimes says open and so does hood.   The radio works most the time.  The alarm likes to let me know it is working when in my garage.  Just the normal gremlins.  I tinker and they go away.  Heated stearing wheel is a no go.  

Other than that great car.  Gets me anywhere in comfort.  Loves to visit Costco as it is always thirsty.   

But I love it and it loves me.",LandRover

"Just to play devil's advocate, it's obviously an asymmetric deal favoring the dealer. Why, and by how much? Great deals on cars move themselves and quickly, but he's telling you this one is ideal and yours is moments away from disaster? I personally tend to distrust a dealer who is using a stick and not a carrot to get you to buy.",LandRover
so you agree then its not worth fixing? Why is the exhaust side so much worse?,LandRover
"If the Evoque was equipped with air suspension, that would likely be an area of concern. It would most likely be a fault in the active dampening or compression circuits.",LandRover
I want Ford to stop masquerading around the place like it‚Äôs a landrover,LandRover
So I have the coil springs from Atlantic British on mine and mine has started doing this exact same thing recently. I‚Äôm not so sure it‚Äôs his air ride.,LandRover
Y would he be selling it after putting all this work in!?,LandRover
Look for parts on your own. It will save you so much money when you have one of these vehicles.,LandRover
The new ford bronco has certainly caught on quickly. At similar price points with options. The only limit to the grenadier is how many they can churn out. People walk up to me every day and tell me they would buy a Land Rover if they made them like they used to again.,LandRover

"Owning a Stage 1, I would have one word of caution to someone fitting a V8 to a standard series body...

There's going to be a serious lack of space front to back in the engine bay.


It's 100% do-able, but expect it to make some maintenance tasks much much harder.


I also tend to agree that re-engining a 45 year old classic car for any reason other than a complete mechanical failure isn't a good move, financially or karma wise.",LandRover

"\^ this, they massively over-promised and it's not clear to me that these will be any better than a new Defender in any way that really matters.

The latter is almost impossible to find.",LandRover
"On the range rover l405 they changed the type of sensor used I think in 2015. You might have an issue with the wrong frequency sensor being fitted.

I've also read that sometimes they need waking up if they are brand new. If you google it you can find forum posts about that issue and the autel machine people use to activate the sensors.

Be wary of fakes if you buy off Amazon or eBay. Some real junk around so stick to reputable sellers",LandRover
"We have a 2023 130 after an X5 and an Audi, no issues mechanically however customer service is different. BMW cs has always been amazing, Audi was ok but LR has left a lot to be desired. We had an issue with the car not locking and it took a lot for LR to look at it/have a loaner whilst they did.

"Believe it or not Carshield is worth checking out. They have like 5 different levels that vary from basic ot pretty much bumper to bumper. They use new OEM parts. You pay monthly and as long as you keep the warranty the vehicle is covered meaning there's no mileage or time limit. This also means if the vehicle gets traded in 1.5 years from now, totalled or stolen that you just stop paying and aren't out as much money and you don't have to come up with $7k up front.

"If you order, to my knowledge and experience, they won't add any additional dealer add-ons without your pre-approval.

BUT all that being said, I would make it clear you don't want ANYTHING additional and possibly get it in writing on your order. Sadly, to my knowledge, there's no legal protection, and they could do it or simply not sell it to you and lump add-ons for someone else.

I've ordered more cars than I should admit, and when you do, they've got you over a barrel. Outside of manufacture sponsored discounts or manufacture financing expect to pay MSRP.

"If it matters to you, the '86 will qualify for the historic vehicles tax exemption in 2 years, which will change your tax class, meaning it's also ULEZ and CAZ exempted... 

*Assuming the engine swap is the only modification and nothing else new has been done that takes it over the ""points"" limit to maintain historic vehicle eligibility.*

Depending where you live/drive regularly that's a massive financial incentive I wouldn't be able to ignore.

&#x200b;

---

In terms of the vehicle's features and construction itself, l things being equal, I'd buy the newer one, for a few reasons:

- the dash changed '89 to accommodate AC in ROW models, meaning it would be straightforward (in so much as it can be) to retrofit AC to the newer defender, but not the older one.

- You can never truly know how well an engine swap was done, if you didn't do it yourself.

- The rear side windows in the hard top are an additional failure point for leakage.

- I could get a set of standard steelies or modulars off eBay, and resell the OEM alloys for a neat little profit.

- The R380^‚Ä† gearbox fitted to a post '94 defender shifts nicer than the LT77 fitted in a '86 model.

None of those is actually a very strong reason though, and even slightly better mileage, service history or condition would win out for me every single time.

&#x200b;

"So I did the same thing and had the same issue. 

Spoke to my mechanic who works on these transmissions and he said the new fluid cleans the seals around solenoids and the valve seals. Which exposes cracks and starts to cause issues like this in an older transmission.

So I replaced the solenoids and valve body seals and everything works perfectly now. Total cost for the seals and solenoids was around $500CAD. If you're going to take it apart then do everything IMHO. 

The transmission fluid was the most expensive since I insisted on using the original ZF fluid and not other cheaper versions. 7 bottles (overkill) but I wanted to make sure I had enough to do the fill properly since pulling out the valve body drained almost all of the fluid in the transmission.

I also used the GAP tool to do a transmission reset and followed the instructions to a T. An example was driving up to (I think) 80kph and then taking your foot off the gas to let the vehicle slow down all the way to a near stop. Down-Shifting on its own as you go. You do this 10 times after the reset.

There are some good videos on YouTube about servicing the solenoids, and if you dig far enough you'll find the info for resetting the transmission. I think it's in the GAP FAQ's Maybe?",LandRover

When I measured the friction/steel stacks they weren't worn but in the end when I put it back in, it still slipped. Ended up dropping the pan again and changing the solenoids and all was right with the world.

The ZF in these beasts is rated for 450+ hp and the AJ-V8 doesn't make anywhere close to that.  FYI...ZF only makes 5 or 6 different solenoids, all based on color (green, brown, black, blue, yellow, ??). The RR/LR version was about double the BMW version with the same color of solenoids.

"I bought a 2013 LR4 with 170k miles last year for $8500. I had it checked out thoroughly with a mobile inspector who spent 3 hours looking over it. He was adamantly against looking at it knowing 'these things have so many issues, like the timing chains, crossover pipes, etc"". I told him he was the guy I wanted to look at it then since he knew the issues and wanted to stay away from it. He called me back after he looked at it and he was surprised at how good it looked. So I jumped in. 

However, a few months later, I started getting a small coolant leak and took it to my local Land Rover 3rd party shop. (Btw, highly recommended to have it checked with a 3rd party shop in your area before buying). He looked it over and the issue was the crossover pipes, which was going to cost me $3500 to fix (including water pump). However, he also said the timing chain was rattling and he recommended to fix that too. In the end, the total cost to get it running well again, was going to be $12k for all the work.  

I had to decide if I was going to put in that much to make it run or to cut bait. I ended up deciding to cut my losses and traded it in on a 2017 Land Rover Discovery HSE Lux with only 50k miles on it and all the maintenance done on it. Plus I splurged on a warranty that covers the engine and drive train for 20 years and unlimited miles. 

As mentioned I would recommend joining a local Rover group if you have one, and find a local 3rd party Rover mechanic and take it there for a check up.

"Just found this comment on a youtube review of the pedal commander that gives me a little more faith in it. Ill give it a try. It is just a youtube comment, so ill have to take it with a grain if salt, but the explanation makes sense as to how it actually does solve input lag.

‚ÄúThrottle by wire systems used to just be a 1:1 analog signal from the pedal, and the ECU's job was to keep up with the engines demands based on input from the engine sensors. Now the pedal sends digital codes to the ECU first, but it's not 1:1 from the foot pedal - everything, including the throttle position, is controlled by the ECU. The pedal is an electronic device is and is just one device of many that sends digital codes to the ECU that tell the engine how to respond. The ECU reads a digital code from the pedal and all other sensors and interprets how to make the engine and transmission work together to reduce emissions and provide a smooth drivable response (thanks to EPA and NHTSA). Throttle sensitivity boosters do more than just amplify the signal from the pedal, and it's done in a way that can not be mimicked by just increasing the speed in which you press the pedal - it talks to the ECU and then the ECU changes everything about how the truck responds - which means the fuel injector ramps, waste gates (boost), shift characteristics, etc. Very simply, it's a ""dumb"" tuner with fixed parameters, and it is not recorded as an ECU change because it's just an input to the ECU, not like a tuner that changes the ECU (which is why it can not be detected by dealers for warranty issues and it's allowed for sale in CA). Think of it this way: your gas pedal sends signals to the ECU that mimics it's position in order of depression - 1, 2, 3 ,4, 5 and so on. It can only be in that order no matter how fast you press the pedal down, and based on that input order, the ECU will not go past a certain ramp up speed no matter how fast you push down the pedal. it will be very close to 1:1 if you press it normally; but the faster you press it down, the ramp curve slows down because the ECU is waiting for the inputs from the emissions system and trans to catch up. But that process is based in part on the digital codes coming from the pedal - in very simple laymens terms, the booster sort of changes the send the order to 1, 3, 5, 7... , or 1,5, 10, 15.. and the ECU is tricked into thinking it has to play catch up, which takes priority over the other emissions and fuel economy inputs. That's way over simplified, but the point is don't think this just increases the analog amplitude of a signal from the gas pedal, because that would obviously have no effect on an ECU controller car.‚Äù",LandRover

"Personally I drive an old school disco 1, I‚Äôm not terribly familiar with the newer rovers but If I can say a few words I will. I‚Äôd a newer rover expensive to fix? Yes for multiple reasons, a lot of shops have a ‚Äúno Land Rover‚Äù policy and charge huge markups in the hourly rate because of the RR badge she wears proudly. Parts tend to be expensive as well but you can find them cheaper some places, if you plan to do your own work, British Atlantic (or Atlantic British, I‚Äôm dyslexic) or rovers north are your two best places to source quality parts! My dad used to have a 2012 RRS HSE for about 4 years, he had very little issues with it and the cost to maintain it wasn‚Äôt expensive due to the lack of problems it had over the years. How often do they need to be fixed? It depends, rovers have a personality and sometimes they go many months without problems, and others the break every other week (you should definitely have a second vehicle or secondary transportation before considering a rover, buy at your own risk), but honestly aside from the occasional sensor and the poorly built air suspension, everything will always boil down to how well it‚Äôs been maintained over the years, you may end up buying a neglected rover and end up catching up on all the missed maintenance, or you could end up buying one that‚Äôs been properly maintained and be trouble free for many miles to come! Like I said, I drive an old disco one, whenever it hard breaks, it‚Äôs usually because I‚Äôm hard on the car (8/10 times I end up over abusing it off road), it‚Äôs truly been a reliable car for me and it‚Äôs definitely a fun rig to drive, and to work on, but that‚Äôs my experience, I know many other people that don‚Äôt have the experiences I‚Äôve had. If you want my advice, I say get the car of your dreams, but plan accordingly, budget for repairs, maybe buy a tool kit (keep it with you in the car‚Ä¶), keep spare oil, coolant, and trans fluid in the car at all times (it‚Äôs British, if it‚Äôs leaking oil, then it‚Äôs still got oil), make sure you know how to change a tire, I‚Äôm talking from experience on this one because with the advanced air ride the rover has, it can be a pain to mess with the settings, it‚Äôs 100% worth it to go over the procedures atleast once before you have to do it in the rain at 2am in BFE. Like others have said, the 5.0 does have a timing chain issue, if you catch it before it fails it shouldn‚Äôt be terribly expensive, if it does end up failing on you, I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. It‚Äôs a rover, the sunroof might leak, just keep an eye on it and catch it before it gets really bad. If the rover is going to break, 7/10 times it‚Äôs electrical rather than mechanical, so you‚Äôll be replacing faulty sensors and fuses more often than pumps, bearings, pulleys, belts etc. with the exception of the suspension (more specifically the air ride suspension which can always be swapped out for coil over suspension for a few grand or if you do the work yourself, you‚Äôll save a lot!). Rovers are quirky little British cars, either you‚Äôll come to love them, or you‚Äôll hate it and never buy a rover again! I love the quirks, my dad on the other hand, didn‚Äôt like dealing with the maintenance. Without knowing too much about your intentions with the rover, all I can say is go for it! One life, live it!",LandRover

"The key difference is the air suspension in the Discovery 5. It can raise the ground clearance at the push of a button. The Discovery Sport can't. However when ground clearance is not an issue the Discovery Sport can easily keep up with a Discovery 5. Sometimes the Discovery Sport will even have the advantage being a bit smaller and less heavy. In tight spaces the massive size of the Discovery 5 is a disadvantage. 

Last year I was at an off-road event from Land Rover. I drove a Discovery Sport and other participants drove a Range Rover Sport and a Defender. I was able to drive through all the obstacles they did, save for one because the Discovery Sport would bottom out. The Range Rover Sport and Defender had more travel in their suspension, so they kept their wheels a bit longer to the ground, but the Discovery Sport didn't really seem to care if it cocked a leg or not. The Terrain Response system just does it's job and you don't notice that much if you have a wheel hanging or not.

With Terrain Response being as good as it is you could argue why you'd still need low range. The Discovery Sport and Range Rover Evoque solve this problem by having a very low first gear and the computer does the rest, emulating a very effective low range equivalent.",LandRover
"With that year in mind you are looking at a late L494, beyond 2022 it would the L461 which replaced the L494. The latest generation of Range Rover Sport is very new, so it's too early to say if there are known problems. Usually it takes five years or so before can really say such a thing. Every L461 sold since is still under warranty, so most problems should be sorted for free right now.

The L494 is well known by now, they are generally fine if you buy one that has been well cared for. Keep in mind that even in good condition these are never cheap cars to own. 

For both types of Range Rover Sport, either get the diesel or the PHEV version. I wouldn't bother with the normal petrol version. The diesels shine on longer trips, if you want to stay closer to home or do a lot of city driving the PHEV is good choice.",LandRover

The best course of action here is comprehensive insurance on the vehicle. I have a ‚Äò99 with nealry 200k on it. I love it but don‚Äôt carry collision insurance on it, if it gets wrecked, it gets wrecked.  I do however have comprehensive on it because of A) catalyitc converters and B) windshield replacement coverage which is nice becuase I‚Äôve got the heated windshield in mine and its super expensive to replace, or rather it would be if insurance didn‚Äôt cover it.",LandRover

Is there a similar graphic / cartoon type deal with the Range Rovers?",LandRover
"First off, it's a Discovery 3 not a LR3. ;) LR3 was just for marketing in the North American market since the Discovery name had suffered too much with the Discovery II there according to the Land Rover marketing department. The rest of the world has always kept  the Discovery name.

The base model diesel could be had with coils instead of air suspension, hence the button to adjust the suspension height is missing. On this entry level version even terrain respons was an option as was the automatic, so the most bare bones ones you'll find just have the high-low switch and nothing more. You won't find many of these though, most people did opt for a higher trim level. Seeing as how prices are these days for a Discovery 3 I would buy a HSE spec one or barring that a XS or SE spec. There is no benefit of going for a low spec model, unless you dislike the air suspension so much or just really want the most bare bones sort of Discovery 3 you can get.",LandRover
I can get you an LR4 with a rebuild motor for a reasonable price if you are interested. Pm me,LandRover

"These are two very different Land Rovers. At a minimum I would test drive both to get a feel for them and see which one fits you better.

Depending on the age of the Range Rover Sport the D300 will either be a Ford Lion diesel or the new Ingenium straight six diesel. The Defender will have the new Ingenium straight six diesel. 

In terms of size the Defender is much bigger. Very handy if you need to haul a lot of things, but this size also works against you in a lot of places. Parking spots will always feel tight or too small and some garages are never going to work. The rear door swings open which can also be a pain if you don't have a lot of room behind your Defender if you need to open it fully. On narrow country roads the Defender will feel like a tanker going through the Panama canal. The Range Rover Sport is big too, but it will feel a bit more agile in comparison. On either of these the 360 degree camera is a must have. 

The Defender will be the most modern of the two seeing as the Range Rover Sport is still from the L494 generation. The Defender will have the Pivi Pro infotainment system and the Range Rover Sport will have InControl Touch Pro Duo. Both offer modern features like Apple Carplay and Android Auto, but given the choice I'd opt for Pivi Pro. It's more responsive and Land Rover is still actively developing it. My Discovery Sport has InControl Touch Pro and the last major updates was from late 2022. Land Rover still supports ICTP officially since they stopped using it in 2022, but don't expect them to add anything new to it.

Keep in mind that both these diesels won't like short trips, they really need longer trips to keep the DPF in good condition.",LandRover
I think you can do oil changes from the top. Don't even have to get under the car. Just YouTube it and do it yourself. Do it every 5k miles. Buy an oil change kit on fcp euro with lifetime replacement. Thank me later,LandRover

"Is it a diesel? Could be the EGR valve stuck open, causing it to eat its own fumes - had this issue on another engine and it presented symptoms similar to bad fuel rail pressure.

"Mileage means nothing if this Discovery has been serviced as it should. I'd rather have a high mileage car with a full service history than a low mileage one that doesn't. This Discovery will have the Ford Lion diesel, which uses a timing belt. The interval is 112,000 miles or 7 years, so this Discovery will be needing one in the near future based on mileage. It probably won't have had a new one just yet, so keep this in mind.

Also if you come from a Freelander 2 be sure to test drive the Discovery 5. Last year I was considering either a Discovery 5 or a Discovery Sport as an upgrade from my Freelander 2. I liked the big Discovery, but it was massive. It really is a very big car and in narrow or small spaces it can get very unpleasant. If you are buying one make sure it has the 360 camera fitted. You really need it.

Also, consider the Discovery Sport. It was the replacement for the Freelander 2. The Discovery Sport is bigger than a Freelander and with ¬£36k you can buy a really nice one. A young Discovery Sport with low mileage and FSH should be very doable with that kind of budget.",LandRover

"See, I don‚Äôt think they *will* replace the Disco with the Defender, though. The Disco is still their value-priced option, and does substantial volume for the brand. Meanwhile, the Defender is more fashion-oriented than anything, and commands higher prices (and probably higher profit margins). And it attracts people who think Range Rovers are too gaudy. It makes sense to have that spread.

The Disco Sport is, of course, the direct replacement for the Freelander 2/LR2; the Range Rover Evoque is, at its core, a ‚Äúsexier‚Äù, more-premium version of that. Both sit on the Premium Transverse Architecture, which somehow still has DNA from the Ford EUCD platform that the Freelander 2 (and gen. 1 XC60, and various other FoMoCars cars) used. Over on the Jaguar side, the E-PACE is related to the Disco Sport and Evoque.",LandRover

I just put some Nokian hakkapeliittia LT3 studded snow tires on in January.  HUGE difference, particularly on hard packed snow and ice.  It's really not even close to similar performance.  I know the coopers aren't the KO2s you suggested but they're still both AT rubber and patterns and I think have comparable performance.  I know I could get by with driving on A/Ts, but busy weekends on the mountain can involve a lot of stop and go traffic.  Stop and go on ice going downhill in a fully loaded 7k pound vehicle isn't fun.  I've done it but I'd rather have the dedicated snow tires.",LandRover

 I'm in nyc so I have a guy who has the SSD software that I used to update my air suspension software that was the issue.  I was having no luck fixing an issue with air suspension until I figured the answer was to update my air suspension software which needed the update to recognize the change from 6 wire ride height sensor to the 3 wire ride height sensor.

"I‚Äôm surprised to see comments here suggesting it‚Äôs a mechanical thing. I‚Äôve never believed it to be a mechanical issue, but clearly a computer input lag/tuning issue. It‚Äôs most apparent to me when I‚Äôm slowing down, rolling a yield sign or a stop sign, and then attempt to accelerate quickly as the car is ‚Äúthinking‚Äù which gear it should be in as I decelerate. 

I don‚Äôt experience this when I‚Äôm at speed or increasing in speed on the highway because the rpms are high enough I guess. I wonder what slowing down and reaccelerating would feel like if I kept it in sport mode.

Just make sure to check it every now and then. That seepage is pretty normal for a 20 year old car. Unless while its running its actively dripping,LandRover
"Holy shit you really are stupid. I'll spell it out to you. JLR has a supply chain issue and can not produce in reasonable numbers. Why do you think they cut trim levels from every model? It's the same reason why they have parts shortages and had to remove the physical buttons on 24s. 

Markups are the solution to low sales numbers and fixed operating costs. To use random numbers, if a dealer usually sells 100 vehicles a month, and had a fixed operating cost of $500,000 a month, they need to make a 5 grand on each vehicle. If they suddenly are selling 50 a month they need to make 10 grand on each vehicle to keep their doors open. 

Now scale this to actual sales numbers and you will understand the markups. Notice how none of the dealerships are exactly rolling in money despite 30k markups? That's how bad the production line is, they are selling at a fraction of what they need to keep the doors open, meaning they are selling way below their normal numbers.

If I sell 10 Rav 4s a day, then suddenly cut production to only sell 5, so there's a 100% markup and more people waiting, that doesn't make it more desirable, it means there's a supply chain issue.

A highly desired car that isn't suffering from a supply chain issue will have a supply days in the low numbers and no to minimal markup, and no parts shortage. 

You are confusing a production issue with desireability. You have 0 idea how this industry works, or how fixed costs in genera work. If still dont get it after using numbers a 1st grader could understand, you can't be helped. You are just flat wrong and the entire industry laughs at you.",LandRover

"I would prefer the P300e over the P200. Being a plug-in hybrid the P300e will deliver vastly better fuel economy and the electric motor provides near instant torque so it feels really quick off the mark. Short trips or driving in urban conditions can be done in full EV mode, circumstances permitting. The big caveat is that in order to reap the benefits of the P300e you need to be able to charge it. If you find yourself unable to charge it on a regular basis you'll be using the petrol engine only and that really does a number on your fuel economy.

I would only consider the P200 if you know you won't be able to charge a P300e or you need more towing weight. The P300e is only rated for 1600kg. The P200 can tow up to 2000kg.

On trail, it's more likely that something from another system besides the engine/trans would be the cause of a stoppage.

My plan is to cut the air line at the air spring and attach a quick attach fitting that will allow me to manualy inflate the spring with my air compressor.

"The L494 can go up to 900mm wading depth. However wading through this much water requires expert off-roading knowledge.

What's wrong with the LR4 that the estimate is 14k? That seems a little extreme,LandRover
"> bad wiring in the dash

If you're having the issue where you lose power to the gauge cluster and it randomly comes back you can pull the cluster out and pop it open and feed a couple zip ties through the slots in the back.  Then, seat the connector and pull some of the cable so that there's not a lot of tension on the connector.  Zip tie cable in place.

This is what fixed mine.",LandRover
"Yeah I think what you're feeling in the sluggish pickup is actually the transmission hesitating to downshift. When I push the pedal there is about 1s delay from the gearbox selecting a new gear, but if switched to sport mode that delay in shift+throttle response is much shorter.",LandRover

On many makes this sends a quick downshift command to the Transmission Control Unit.

You can verify it‚Äôs the shift command delay by using the gear select to go from 1, 2, and D and see if there‚Äôs the same response issue when commanded manually.

"Talk to the dealership first, and explain that would would like to place an order for a car. Be direct and explain that you are not willing to pay over MSRP and ask if there are any additional fees or ""required dealership add-ons"" that they require.  Some dealerships (not just Land Rover) will require dealer add on packages for paint protection/leather protection, and some other stuff that should cost $500 - $1000. However, they will force you to buy this package for $10,000 and insist that it is not optional. It's bullshit and I hate it.

Anyway, have that conversation with them up front.

If they are forcing add-ons/over MSRP markup, then call the next dealer. 

Once that is settled then you will know where you need to order from.",LandRover
"They don't really say, but the original 375hp was always enough for me. That being said, my ""seat of the pants"" meter says it's much more than the old one.

Yes, these modules aren't the cheapest but you get what you pay for in my opinion. I'd rather spend more on a quality system with a quality installation than forever chasing down faults because I went with some cheap Chinese hardware.

Since your Discovery Sport is a 2019 you could also see if you can upgrade it from InControl (8 inch screen with physical buttons) to InControl Touch Pro (10 inch screen with no buttons). If you are UK based a company called LR Retrofits does these installs, provided your car has most of the hardware already installed. Jaguars from 2018 onwards had everything already installed, it's just a matter of swapping the screen and doing some activations.

"There‚Äôs some truth to this. 

Land Rover seems to consider the Series I and Series II a single generation, the Series II being essentially a heavy refresh of the Series I. Most of the body panels were changed, but the frame, body structure and dimensions were the same. The Series II was retroactively badged L318 once Ford took over (Ford parlance for chassis codes is usually a brand or segment signifier as a letter, and then three numbers).

It‚Äôs the same with the 3 and 4. The 4 is clearly an evolution of the 3, and both have the same chassis code, L319. Unlike the I and II, the only exterior parts changed between the 3 and 4 were bolt-on components.

That would mean that the current L462 Disco is only the third generation of the nameplate. And, honestly, it‚Äôs quite a capable vehicle. Despite losing the separate ladder frame, it‚Äôs far more rugged than just about any other luxury midsize SUV, and is every bit a proper Land Rover. You just need to get over the styling‚Ä¶which I‚Äôve not been able to do.

That said, since Land Rover has called the prior two versions Disco 3 and Disco 4, it follows that the new one is Disco 5. It‚Äôs just that they‚Äôve stopped using the numbers at all.",LandRover
"How did it flood? Quick dunk or in and out? Insurance?

"There are a lot of factors at play here that influence how fast your brakes will wear down. The most obvious one is driving style. If you drive like the Stig and have to hit the brakes hard every time, they're going to wear down pretty quick. If you have a more powerful engine like the D240 or P250 it will also cause more wear on the brakes compared to say a D150. Cars fitted with an automatic gearbox also wear their brakes harder because you need to use them more often, compared to a manual which allows you to brake using the engine. Quality of the discs also plays a part. Brake discs made by a less reputable brand can wear down faster than you'd like. That price difference had to come from somewhere, just like when you fit cheap rubber. If you have low rolling resistance tyres it means you have to brake harder to achieve the same results as when you have normal tyres fitted, again meaning your brake discs and pads are going to wear quicker.

There is no easy answer here. If your brakes are getting worse a warning light should come on, or you might get a fail or advisory during your MoT. If you need to replace them, be sure to fit OEM quality at minimum or buy from a reputable brand like Brembo.",LandRover

"Johnson Rods says starting at 32"" some trimming may be needed for LR4 because it has a bit less room than LR3. At a guess probably the arch liners are a somewhat different design since the flares are, as well.

I would also say that neither vehicle is really suited to 32"" tires mechanically since the travel limits of the suspension system will allow a 32"" to contact the arch liners on both at max upward travel. KO2s seem like the better solution, to me. R/Ts and snow tires aren't that much more amazing than them and you can get them in load range E for 265/65R18",LandRover

You can test this simply enough:

Bad LCA's:   
50-60 MPH, light braking, steering wheel shakes like crazy. Goes away if you brake hard or get below 35mph. 

Warped Rotors:  
Shakes worse as rotor heats up, like coming down a mountain etc. Shimmy will change with speed, get slower as you slow down. If they're bad enough you can ""Count"" the individual raised spots on the rotor as you come to a stop.",LandRover

"I would say it depends on what recent repairs have already been made and what is covered by the warranty. Also if you have the ability to fix anything yourself. If you can buy parts and fix things yourself I think you‚Äôd spend much less than $7k over 3 years. 

If you‚Äôre paying a mechanic for everything that may be a good deal. It also depends on what is covered though. LR4 usually has problems with coolant leaks and fuel pumps. Your suspension parts will eventually wear out and need to be replaced, same for brakes. But I wouldn‚Äôt expect those to be covered.

But imaging driving on the highway doing 70/80 not feeling comfortable with coils,  but with air suspension, the vehicle lowers to assist with handling and ride gets firmer.

"Oh we're talking studded snow tires then yes that does make a big difference. I really couldn't say exactly how much modding is required to fit them in 32"" configuration, haven't owned an LR4 myself, but I have seen people running them on compmotives at rallies. I dunno, you seem pretty comfortable with modding, so I'd say do the LR3 mods to it, yolo the tires, and then figure out where they still don't fit because I'd bank on it being arch liners catching on them at full lock, and that you could probably remold them out of the way with a heat gun.

"How much do you drive and is it a Land Rover dealer offering it or what dealer? Is there a cap on the amount also (ie they will only cover up to value of car at time of purchase or only cover ‚ÄúX dollar amount‚Äù worth of repairs). There can be lots of little ‚Äúcatches‚Äù in the contract which drastically change whether or not it‚Äôs a good deal. Avoid third party warranty companies in general. Definitely do not use concord auto protect, they are a scam company.

As for your situation, the car isn‚Äôt likely worth 7k in repairs  honestly (assuming you purchased somewhere around 20k usd). That being said, if you love the car, drive a lot, and want to keep it for 3+ years, it could be worth it to get that dealer plan AT DIFFERENT RATE/TERMS.

A simple turbo repair which usually fail around 70-100k is about 6-7k usd at a Land Rover dealer. Replacing an Engine is well over 15k (and if they cap the repair amount you may be on the hook for thousands in that case regardless). I‚Äôd argue that suspension, driveline parts (axles, diff pumps/haldex etc), timing chains /water pumps commonly fail or need repairing by 120k miles and are all expensive. Most repairs at a Land Rover dealer will run at least a few thousand no matter what the issue is you‚Äôre repairing.  Key factor is which repairs and maintenance services/repairs have been done already.

If I were you, I would try and see if they would up the mileage amount +/- duration, aim for 50k-60k miles over 4 years instead (or at least try for more miles if they go longer than 3 years). Also, make sure it‚Äôs $0 deductible and they use OEM parts only AND THE CONTRACT COVERS ALL LABOR COSTS as well. Carefully check the contract for any exclusions (ie they may not cover if there‚Äôs a technical service bulletin on the issue, if the failure is due to mechanical wear, lack of following service guidelines, lubrication issue etc).

Assuming no catches and the contract is fair and from a Land Rover dealer (or perhaps a VERY well respected third party dealer ), I would def do 7k for 60k miles/4 years with $0 deductible.  you‚Äôll likely have 7k worth of repairs by that mileage/year point.  50k/4years decent chance as well. 38500 miles at 7k seems much too steep and there‚Äôs a decent chance you go that period without 7k worth of repairs‚Ä¶especially true if you get repairs at third party/independent shops and opt for non oem parts (that are still high quality).  For 38500 miles I‚Äôd be hard pressed to pay anything over 4k usd honestly. 


My advice, if that‚Äôs their best offer, pass & set aside the 7k for maintenance costs and repairs as they come along (and hope the engine lasts at least 38500 miles).  Or alternatively, set aside 2k for repairs and invest the other 5k in the stock market‚Äîhopefully you‚Äôll get a nice return in 3 years.",LandRover

Around 10 years is the traditional upper bound for replacing critical rubber and plastic components under the hood that get brittle due to heat cycling ‚Äîcooling system hoses, serpentine belt, thermostat and hosing, y-crossover pipe (if this one has it? Might be the V8), water pump, coolant flush, transmission filter and fluid, etc. You‚Äôll also be close to needing to replace other expensive items that aren‚Äôt covered by a warranty (note these are items you don‚Äôt replace unless they fail, but they routinely fail around 60-100k miles)‚Äîfront air struts, front lower control arms, rear upper control arms, a couple wheel bearings/hub assemblies, maybe the air compressor.

This engine is not widely known for having timing chain problems, but it still happens. Get a PPI and make sure they scan the ECU and are able to do a cold start. 

Anyway, $7k would cover the cost of most, if not all, of these items at an independent shop. If DYI, probably about 1/3-1/2 that cost. I‚Äôd rather do that and know it‚Äôs in the best condition it can be.

Change the oil and filter every 5k and you‚Äôll be very low risk for internal engine problems.",LandRover
"I don't see anything wrong with the Discovery 5. My main complaint would be it's size, in tighter spaces it can be difficult to drive. 

I'm not sure if we'll see a Discovery 6, sales for the big Discovery aren't that great for a long time. Land Rover is supposedly working on a Defender Sport, so we might just see the Discovery name being dropped. The Defender would take it's place and the Defender Sport would occupy the space the Discovery Sport has.",LandRover
"101FC!!!!!

Stop! 


I can only handle so much LR fetishism in 24 hrs!",LandRover
"Ahh sorry I didn‚Äôt realize. Everytime I search for Land Rover hse, i like whatever image shows up. When I look at the details of one I like, it just says make is Land Rover and model is Range Rover. Basically it‚Äôs the one that looks like the LR4 but with a slanted back instead of the straight back.",LandRover
"In the States, the D130 V8 did not get official approval in time for the 2024 model year. 
I know that Canada has different regulations, so you may need to get confirmation from your local dealer as to whether it‚Äôs even a thing this model year",LandRover
I hope 6 is cheaper than 5!!!!,LandRover
200tdi doesn't fit the 380 they use the old LT77. Which is fine.,LandRover
And it looks ugly,LandRover
"Oh God! Now I need someone to pour petrol in *my* eyes, too!",LandRover
Southeast Georgia so more mud and rain than snow. Good to know! My X7 was fully loaded. This is a rude awakening for sure. ü§£,LandRover

Welcome to the rrs club. Nice combo..just like mine .,LandRover
"Not normal, but it will feel less firm than a sports car generally.¬†",LandRover
"The LR4 is definitely a truck and not a sports car, the brake feel is‚Ä¶well, it‚Äôs better than a Tundra but not as good as a M3. 

Get the fluid changed and bled, might help. Any shop can do it, should be like $100ish",LandRover
"Thank you! List price is $11,995. I have a full CARFAX, haven‚Äôt gotten to requesting service records beyond what is listed there (and I haven‚Äôt looked at it in detail yet). I can share that report if it helps!",LandRover
I feel sea sick looking just at the pics ü§¢,LandRover
"Make sure it has been serviced and that it was serviced more often than JLR says it should. The official interval is 21,000 miles or 2 years, which is silly. Ideally this Discovery Sport has been serviced every 8,000 miles or ever year. 

The biggest problem to look out for is oil dilution with the Ingenium diesels. Because the DPF is fitted further from the engines, regenerations take longer increasing the chance the engine is shut off during a regen. If this happens the excess diesel leaks into the sump, degrading the oil. This in turn can lead to other problems due to poor lubrication, like timing chain and turbo failures. Weak guides on the early Ingenium diesels can also lead to stretching and failing timing chains. If this Discovery Sport is running the latest software it should warn you if the oil quality has dropped too far. When taking this car for a test drive, listen on start up if you can hear a rattle from the engine. If it rattles, it's the timing chain.

If this is the 150 HP model, keep in mind it won't be quick. Since it appears to be entry level trim, I suspect it's going to be a 150 HP engine. The 180 HP and 240 HP diesels could only be had on higher trim levels.",LandRover
The part they didn‚Äôt steal.,LandRover
Thanks mate.,LandRover
Thanks! It‚Äôs really nice with the blackout package. I‚Äôve been making little coffee and tea runs just to get behind the wheel and enjoy some bliss.,LandRover
"It might have something wrong with it, it might not. It‚Äôs impossible to tell from a photo. 

You‚Äôll have to use your own thoughts and knowledge! Imagine that. 

Mods need to do something about these zero effort posts.",LandRover
Doesn't the newer aj suffer from timing chain,LandRover
100% no,LandRover
"What has Clarkson got a 57 plate range rover as a daily, obviously a good car,
Also if it ain't broken don't fix it type thing",LandRover
"Yes, absolutely.  Overall the best Land Rover I have ever owned.

I have my bitches about it sure, but in the end it's a reliable, comfortable off-roader that has let me keep exploring the western USA.  

I got an X-Dynamic 110 P400, but opted for a 5 seater so I could install a second battery system and radios in the space below the load shelf in the rear.  It also means the second row seats fold flat if that's important to you.  I can throw all my crap in it, and head out for a week or two and have fun.

Meanwhile back in town here in SoCal the engine has great power and economy, and the safety and assistance features are great for driving in traffic.

If you have any specific questions or concerns, fire away.",LandRover
"Wait, you went from Toyota to Land Rover?  Welcome to the abyss. Look down. The abyss will look right back at you and tell you that the $25k for the new engine will not be the end of it. Choose wisely!",LandRover
For the Chinese market!,LandRover
"Idk, title document says LR3. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",LandRover
"I think they all sound like that, they all have kind of rattley engines. Have you done the timing chains yet? I don't think it's that but it might be something to look Into in the future",LandRover
"Bought a 2010 (base) for $8,200 with similar mileage 2 years ago.  Here's what I didn't check and had to get done:

Coolant crossover pipe (water pump wile in there), valve cover gasket, tranny rebuild.

I do not know if the timing chain tensioners were ever replaced.  I'm close to 160K miles now.

I wasn't able to get a service history on the vehicle and rolled the dice.  I wish you luck in your search!",LandRover
"Would your warranty cover the AC repair for new compressor/condenser since it was a prior known issue? I take it the dealer disclosed this prior to sale otherwise they should have paid for it to be fixed themselves. Replacing A/C /compressors/condenser can run around 2500-3k usd with labor and if they cover it fully that makes it much more favorable for you.

Also, is the car being sold ‚Äúas is‚Äù but a separate after the fact option for purchasing warranty?

have you had the engine looked at by independent mechanic and also confirmed no misfires and no repeated misfires since the 2022 repair (plus how many miles were put on the vehicle since the 2022 misfire repair involving the coils/injectors/plugs etc)? Hopefully a lot of miles and no history of misfires or further servicing regarding misfiring/engine programming between 2022-now. Also, if there was history of repeat engine work/module ecu programming or repairs for misfire listed on the full service history or carfax (prior to the 2022 , that raises concerns).

Repeated misfires in same cylinder could be signs of engine damage or compression loss which would make your risk for engine failure way higher, especially if there was history of engine programming etc which could have been done for misfires. It could just be foul spark plugs or coils etc , but could be much more serious‚Ä¶ and if few miles were put on since 2022 repair the owner may have sensed a failure approaching and sold for some other sucker to deal with‚Ä¶unfortunately there‚Äôs people who even have fault codes cleared prior to sale to mask issues.

At the very least, I‚Äôd want something in writing there is no engine damage or signs of damage and it was inspected by your dealer.  try and get them to guarantee they will do any engine repairs or replace engine if there‚Äôs failure/issues within at 60 days or 1000 miles (in writing) since purchase, free of charge at no cost to you. 

If you do get a warranty from them, try and negotiate  a higher mileage or more favorable terms at least for the engine and associated parts due to history of misfire in same cylinder (ie maybe add an extra 1-2 years with 15-20k  miles covering engine/engine components only. That way your engine is covered under a slightly longer contract that continues past the rest of warranty. Even better if they make agree to longer term for powertrain, which would include much more than just engine (such as transmission, differentials, driveshafts etc)‚Ä¶but probably unlikely.

you‚Äôll want to make sure warranty is as close to bumper-to bumper/comprehensive as possible and covers repair for covered part and any associated parts needed for repair of that part (even if not listed specifically). You should see if your contract is known as exclusionary warranty, where the contract ONLY lists the items which specifically are NOT covered‚Ä¶ie excluded.. typically this type of contract is the best and most similar to manufacture/bumper to bumper warranty. The other type is inclusionary contract which specifically lists covered parts and anything not listed therefore won‚Äôt be covered‚Ä¶ this usually is a poor option as you‚Äôll end up on the hook paying for portions of repairs and stuff you never even thought about (which can be very costly). For instance, if your contract covers the engine block but won‚Äôt cover gaskets, fluids, nuts/bolts, belts, chains, spark plugs, water pumps, diagnostic or programming of engine , etc‚Ä¶. These things are necessary but if the contract is inclusionary they may not be covered (unless specifically listed).

Lastly, find out how claims are handled and what happens if denied‚Ä¶ crucial to find out who ‚Äúbacks‚Äù the warranty (does the dealer back it themselves or do they have a 3rd party insurer. this matters for when claims are denied‚Ä¶ if they have a third party backer (insurer/administrator) and the dealer denies the repair, you can circumvent the dealer and file the claim/appeal with their insurer to try and get approval or money etc. If they don‚Äôt have a backer (ie no insurer, the dealer ‚Äúbacks‚Äù themself), the dealer essentially has all the power to approve or deny however they want‚Ä¶.and if they deny your claim there‚Äôs not much you can do (legal actions are long and costly for consumers and rarely worth it which they know). You‚Äôll also want to know if repairs can only be done at their dealership or where else (and can you chose location for repair?), how do you go about payment for repair or obtaining reimbursement for repair? Bonus if they offer any perks like free loaner or rental car reimbursement for repairs that take multiple days.",LandRover

how many miles on the chassis? I doubt the block is any good.,LandRover
Tannerite is more comparable to ammonium nitrate though,LandRover
"This is great. Thank you. Seems like there could be a business out there to get car-specific kits put together ahead of time. Someone like me who wants an ‚Äúeasy button‚Äù to just click and go.

That said, this is super exhaustive. I was thinking more along the lines of ‚Äúget a 10mm, 13mm, etc. because these are the most used items to‚Ä¶.‚Äù",LandRover
"Realistically what do you think you can do on the road other than change out for your one spare or replace some fuses? You usually need replacement parts and/or fluids to do anything that needs tools. So unless you‚Äôre planning on bringing a water pump or some control arms, keep the tools to things you might personally need day to day",LandRover
I don't see anything defender looking on that. Looks more like an ev,LandRover

"Oh I see, the ECU actually needs retrained? This procedure seems like a PITA, but worth it if it works. Guess I need my own GAP ID after all. Thanks for the link!",LandRover
"Yep. I mean, its livable, especially if the LR3 is your primary vehicle and you get used to adapting to the lag. But now that they are getting up in age and more of us have modern electric or hybrid or turbo vehicles as our primary, the difference in response time is scary to come back to, especially if you forget try to punch it to merge in traffic or something and the truck just does not react at all.",LandRover
Emphasis on ‚Äòwants‚Äô,LandRover
"Not really a fan of the split e/ICE system on the SPA Volvos, seems like an afterthought and doesn't give the performance that the specs suggest. For the XC90, whatever, it's a big-ish SUV. But for the T8 cars, it would be nice to have some serious performance out of the box given the lack of aftermarket.",LandRover
Oof,LandRover
It looks good. Get a PPI done when you get it and that will answer your own question.,LandRover
Have you tried clearing the engine and transmission adaptations?,LandRover
"The newer option OP posted is a '96 build 300Tdi, so should have an R380.

The older one is the 200Tdi, so will either have it's original LT77 from '85, or the LT77S that came with the engine.",LandRover
"Would probably help if you had a genuine copy, it looks like it‚Äôs confused as the new RLCM has a later software version than the database. (If not was genuine it would go to topix and check but as it‚Äôs a cracked version it‚Äôs using a local database)",LandRover
I have been able to do all the other  maintenance on this ride sofar.,LandRover
Rear air suspension issue noted.,LandRover
">The V8 is shorter than the six, and with a modern serp front end it gives acres of room in a Series engine bay.


[I respectfully suggest you're at least mildly exaggerating the available room.](https://www.lrukforums.com/attachments/s4300667-jpg.53288/)


I suppose it can't make it worse than the six-cyl but all the photos I've seen of conversions result in either:


- Chopping the footwell for room and a really cramped engine bay longitudinally, or


- Replacing the front wings with Stage 1 or Defender parts and fitting a Defender grille, creating something that looks a little weird.


Like it's very do-able, but involves some compromises.


I think if you wanted to keep the original S3 grille, using a single carb V8 would at least make the air cleaner assembly take up a lot less space (LR's four different official designs for the Stage 1 induction system are all behemoths of convoluted 2¬Ω"" ducting)",LandRover
Are those dealer quoted prices? I haven't found my 5.0 L322 to be nearly that bad at a my reputable independent mechanic.,LandRover
I was wondering about the lack of information I could find before hand!! Cheers mate lots of help !,LandRover
