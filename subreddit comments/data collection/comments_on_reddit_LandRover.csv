That is truly a beauty ,LandRover
That teal one 😍,LandRover
Aren’t wraps expensive though?,LandRover
Is that clicking normal,LandRover

"My mistake, I conflated the dealer with your local Rover tech",LandRover
There you have it. Try again in a month.,LandRover
Pm me I can perhaps find you one and rebuild the motor.,LandRover
Any place better or worse? Did they let you use your own shop? What kind of repairs did you encounter?,LandRover
I always thought that the new discovery had been branded as a defender,LandRover
Sweet man. What mileage did you get your LR4 and what is at now? What repairs did you have to do?,LandRover
"Its not a hard swap and the 6 pot is a piece of shit that drink petrol . With a weber carb u can get 16 to 17 mpg 
And 12 with the old junky zenith carb 

A tdi work a treat with disco 1 diffs 

Pretty sure the tdi has same bellhouse bolt patern . 
But it may need a 4 pot  bellhousing . Its been many years since i was doing these conversions and we would put ford Essex  v6 in with a steve parker conversion plate . 

The info u seek with be on the forums . Redit or fb groups  are full of idiots . Get on the lro forums and the ozzy one . 

Hreat old bus . Power steering should be high on your list to do .  We use to use a 3 bolt rangrover box as they were plentyfull but they all have same fitting 3 4 and 6bolt . Some fab needed .",LandRover
"There is a lot of misinformation surrounding ZF transmissions, mainly because most shops and transmission experts won’t touch them unless they came out of a ford. The weak point of the ZF is definitely the valve body and associated seals.",LandRover
Thank you didn’t buy it,LandRover
"I would absolutely agree to a quote for 13,000 yen if the quality was up to snuff.",LandRover
The new Defender should have been six.,LandRover
I opened this expecting massive front end damage from an lr2 dropped off of a lift.  Glad this isn't that.,LandRover
Agreed,LandRover
"I think a lease would be silly in your case. If you are going to stroke a check, might has well just keep the thing for 3 years and sell it on your own after that, no interest payed out. Alternatively, if you finance it, can you make more money than the interest rate with that money?

As far as unexpected costs, the car will be under warranty for 4years/50k miles. Only thing you are on the hook for is the consumables. If you choose to keep the truck, you can buy an extended warranty *before* the factory warranty expires.

So far, that straight six is proving to be a very solid motor.

Rover have similar or less PITAness compared to the Germans. I wouldnt worry about it coming from BMW/AUDI ownership. Only time I ""gate keep"" people from a Rover is if they're used to maintaining a 98 Corolla and think the $200 bucks they spent on pads an rotors that one time was a lot (True story)",LandRover
"Considering I was quoted 5k for new headlight assembly (mine yellowed - just buffed them instead), something tells me you’re not being reamed *that badly*",LandRover
"I don't like the newer cars, modern engines are too delicate (especially in the EU, with all the environmental regulations. Euro6 diesels with Adblue have so many issues), there are too many driving assistants (that I find noisy, intrusive and unreliable), infotainment can't keep up with new technologies (development cycles in car industry are much longer than mobile industry so products are obsolete as soon as they are released, I just use my phone for everything and don't need more than an AUX connector). For me the peak in the car industry was in the years 2010-2015, and cars from that time can still be found with a reasonable mileage. I hope my 2012 Discovery 4 will last many many years because I don't want a D5 and there isn't much competition (considering I need 7 seats daily).",LandRover
"Man, a 101FC is my final bucket list Land Rover.  I have been looking for one for many many years.

Enjoy it!",LandRover
Probably some old merchandise that was sold through dealerships. They have a lot of weird gear and clothes and knickknacks that they will have made up and sold through dealer parts departments but usually in limited quantities. If it's official it may have a part# on it somewhere.,LandRover
"apologies! moving to the correct sub, missed the pinned post.",LandRover
"It’s missing a ‘if you can read this, please turn me over’ sticker, because those are the peak of class.",LandRover
that isnt the case. I havent even looked at the car yet. Nor has he seen mine. Purely my own opinion and opinion of local land rover guy i do maintenance with. Nothing to do with dealer to be clear. The trade ins definitely help the deal and im sure he;ll make money on both tbh.,LandRover
Looks shit. Typical Chinese products,LandRover
The AJ engine in the Defender is a much better engine than the BMW crap LR is forced to use for now.,LandRover
Series 3?,LandRover
Already have a hilux. I like how the lr4 drove better.,LandRover
Dime a dozen in So Cal. It's a very pretty color.,LandRover
I checked with multiple service centres and they estimated from 1000-1800.,LandRover
"Pretty much every V8 into a Series results in chopping the tunnel/footwell, the six is not unique in that, but it's not a massive deal and at least you end up with a vehicle that still sounds good and drives smoothly and in a relaxed fashion.

No need for a Defender front end (that would be an abomination unto the lord), you can fit it in easily enough, or for extra room you can move the radiator further forward in the front panel & trim the back of it down, there's a good 6"" of fresh air in front of the radiator. People have fitted V8 + 5spd and LT230 into Series 1 80"" a hundred years ago, it's not rocket surgery.

Air filter use whatever fits, the round ones from the TDi's are actually a good option.",LandRover
Oh no,LandRover
Look at the price on this one. 😦[LR3 used](https://www.bocadrive.com/details/used-2008-land-rover-lr3/101517914),LandRover
Exactly !,LandRover
"American created and owned. Constructed on Chinese soil by an American company to American standards. Buy a Chinese iPhone… it won’t have the quality. 

That’s a Chinese car created to Chinese standards.",LandRover
"Sounds like the exact kind of ""$1000-est"" LR3 I aspire to own lol.",LandRover
Series III had plastic grills.,LandRover
Really? I think it looks like 5 different knock-off Chinese SUV's glommed into one. Not as clean & functional as an OE Defender or G-Wagen but still very ugly especially the front.,LandRover
"Auto and 300TDI is an odd combination, rust they rust check that out thoroughly before sinking any more money into it.",LandRover
"I live in India and there only one option that's is P460e and I do long trips I have another car for city this will be for my long trips, and at this price point there on other competing it BMW X7 and MERC GLS are way less cheaper than this but they have so much of boy roll that's why l'm considering Sport and there is rule also in India that diesel model will be valid for only 10 years and petrol for 15 years and everyone wants a decent resell value",LandRover
Thats a dead port. If you stick you finger in there you'll see that its blocked. On other vehicles its used for something. On the LR2 the sound generator was not needed,LandRover
"2010 original owner here. I changed the oil about every 7500 miles and got the timing chain code at 112,000 miles. But what has really been a bear this last 12 months is the cooling system leaks. I have had just about every single part of it replaced now. The plastic bits just wear out. I don't do the work myself either, which is a shame.

&#x200B;

As for electrical - absolutely problem free since the start.",LandRover
"you can buy a 2013 v8 lr4 with 23k miles on it for 24k, the cost they were talking about for a engine rebuild",LandRover
appreciate it. I never considered how good sunrises would look with all the sun/moon roofs. Really more into the mattress now than a rtt,LandRover
"No issues with my p400 SE, just random buttons don’t work sometimes that’s it lol. The p400 has a bmw engine I believe",LandRover
It’s a iones grenadier  fieldmaster.,LandRover
Bouncing off rocks like that always makes me feel sorry for the drivetrain.,LandRover
"Caught that before it got bad. New compressor and blew the lines clean as a whistle. I had a feeling so I'm glad I did this. Thanks for solidifying that. I felt so bad for spending that much lol 

What's this Atlantic British app? Is it like a diagnosis app?",LandRover
Was always under the impression the 5 was just a generation. 2017 Discovery HSE,LandRover
"It's super nice, but will it ever get to play in the dirt properly, like it's defender bredren?",LandRover
"Get one with air suspension. It's a big part of the terrain response system if you want to go off-roading. The air suspension isn't very complex, it usually only fails on one of two components: the air springs or the valve block. While parts aren't the cheapest around, it is not the difficult to repair.

If this Discovery 3 will be used mostly for on road use I wouldn't even consider a lifted Discovery. The lift will only bring disadvantages when driving around town.",LandRover
"It looks very nice. BaT does seem your best bet. $45k would be top money for a ‘94.  The only trucks selling over $30k on BaT in the last year are restored 1995s, 2-Doors, or rare 2dr convertibles.",LandRover
"Yeah for me other then weird Land Rover problems: 
- the hood latch not working 
- leaking windscreen 
- broken door locks 
- broken seat motors 
- broken mirror motor
- tpms errors
- exhaust faults 
- dead battery ( more then once ) 
- software issues causing the Bluetooth to fail 

It’s been good. I’ve owned 4 Land Rover discovery’s and this is by far the most reliable. 

It’s also great in the mud and fine on fuel ( I get just under 850km per tank mixed driving )",LandRover
"And pay for the 5-7k mile oil changes. It's a 6 digit car,  don't neglect it with their 21k mile intervals.",LandRover
"Ah that makes more sense, are there no independent shops near you? It would probably cut the estimate in half almost",LandRover
"Thanks. Maybe I can use that for next time. I just had surgery and currently can’t lift over 5lbs, but dashboard says next oil change 0 miles.",LandRover
"Yea that’s why I’m asking here first before I buy the part lol. Thanks for the info. 

EBay is wild for the amount of people trying to sell you a fake part or claiming it’s genuine",LandRover
RRS,LandRover
"Yes. I am ordering the pedal commander and report back if it actually changes the lag or if it just artificially shortens the pedal throw.

Very sick of being gaslit by people who’ve never experienced a car with reasonable throttle response saying theres no issue with the LR3 or that it must be a problem with mine. Ive driven several L319 and L320, they all completely suck in terms of throttle lag.",LandRover
Yeah looks like the new Hyundai Santa Fe.,LandRover
"The exit angles of the 3/4 look better than the 2 and about same as 1 which is highly regarded. Plus, these aren’t with the suspension raised which gives it even more room. I have both a D1 (1997) and an LR3.",LandRover
3rd gear is generally the limp mode gear. A valve body might be a good move. Honestly fluid condition is going to be a good indicator of what’s going on in the transmission.,LandRover
Ah I get you now. Cheers,LandRover
AAA,LandRover
I think Throttle House [said it best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etqrW21LG6o)...,LandRover
"Read my post. Everything you mentioned has been done. My truck is perfectly maintained. Everything about the air and fuel delivery systems are either new or recently serviced and it has always been this way. The issue isn’t a lazy response that you’d see from bad injectors or a dirty throttle body or Maf, its a laggy response, meaning the ECU isn’t even attempting to open the throttle despite the pedal being pressed",LandRover
I had this on mine. It was the caliper. Swapped the two rears and it went away. Never came back in 2-3yrs,LandRover
"The TDV6 can be difficult to start in colder weather due to how it attempts to start. When you try to start the car won't wait for the glow plugs to do their job, it just cranks while the glow plugs come one, trying to compensate with the fuel/air mixture. While the idea is nice in theory, it means the TDV6 isn't a fan of the cold. 

You could try and test the glow plugs to begin with. Testing the glowplugs is easy on the TDV6 as the 2 multi plugs sit on the top of the engine either side of the oil filter. Should any of them have failed, then comes the difficult part of the job. Changing the glow plugs on a Ford Lion diesel is no small task. Usually they're pretty entrenched and trying to screw them out will often result in one breaking off.",LandRover
Very helpful info. I’ll give it a shot once I get it to start again.,LandRover
"I just got me an education - thanks!! 

The historic status is a real consideration.",LandRover
"These sometimes suffered with the brake booster failing and letting oil into the booster itself. 

Open the bonnet, and get someone to either brake the brake all the way whilst the other is listening to the brake booster, it you hear a gurgling noise then it's done for and needs replacing.

There's also a rubbing grommet on top of it which you can stick a cable tie down to see if there's any oil down there.",LandRover
Prob needs a fuel pump.   Is it an LR4 or older RRS?  Usually doesn’t have any drivability issues but could.,LandRover
Very tidy looking Series 2 109” long wheel base,LandRover
"We drive NJ->VT every weekend to ski, so buttloads of miles.   I regularly tow a trailer hitch full of gear since I have 3 kids, also a 24’ CC.  I do all the maintenance- so whatever it needs gets done.  Regular oil is most important.   My skid plate was cut to make oil changes a bit easier…",LandRover
"Holy shit, why would anybody pay that for a lease? Simply insane.",LandRover
Id look so cool in that,LandRover
In what way do the belts drive you nuts?,LandRover
Yess brother u can buy and enjoy the defender experience! I was a BMW fan I had only BMW in my life but after I drove a defender it’s another level,LandRover
"So I’m pretty much sold on the idea of the Range Rover Sport.  Just read a horror story where a dude bought a 2014 LR. Within a year, the engine locked up.  $20K for an engine. 6 months later, his transmission blew. $7K for a new transmission.  $27K in repairs. I know it’s not likely, but I don’t want that to be me.",LandRover
Nah mate.  It drives absolutely nothing like the new defender    The grenadier is a rough no frills back breaker    I suppose it depends what folks want really.  Old school or cutting edge,LandRover
Any Mongoose/ Mangoose cable to recommend?,LandRover
I’d recommend the same-choose a different dealer. I went in circles on the phone with the San Antonio Rover salesman and I just eventually bought from the Houston LR dealership.,LandRover
Geoffrey Croker wants a talk with you.,LandRover
Northeast U.S.,LandRover
It's a different manufacturer?,LandRover
Can’t park there mate,LandRover
"True, the car scene has women too. If OP ever went to a car meet they would know all kinds of different people build up their rides.",LandRover
😆,LandRover
"Watch Croker Vs Rover on youtube, he's doing a very similar Discovery right now although his is V8.

300TDi is a decent engine, behind an auto it's not going to win any races. Give it a damn good service, change ALL the fluids & grease everything and see where you are.

All the factory manuals & parts books are online as free PDF's, also recommend LR4x4 forum for technical stuff.",LandRover
Insurance ppl are hot on my tail!,LandRover
Declined. Over limit. What now?,LandRover
Damn I wish I did,LandRover
The real flex would be showing off the 101FC ;),LandRover
This is a joke right?,LandRover
Perfection. Happy Birthday!,LandRover
It’s all related to supply and demand and of course the labor involved,LandRover
bummer. hope you can get this back on the road!!!,LandRover
"If your oil level isn’t plummeting, a little oil in the engine bay is perfectly normal. Even the healthiest of cars have a little oil in the engine bay. The only concern is if the oil level is dropping quicker than you can top it up 😂",LandRover
This guy landrovers.,LandRover
"You'd think that if it were, they'd be a little less useless about clearing the roof",LandRover
275&285/50r20 fits without issues,LandRover

Land Rovers and VWs. Two excellently made vehicles… which you never touch with a ten foot pole if they’re second hand and have known issues.,LandRover
"“Seating” is a bit of a stretch 😄 

*Staples some foam to bits of plywood and throws it in the boot…* **aaaand….  TIME**",LandRover
Can we introduce a vehicle that works without any data connection? I am very wary of putting financial capability/ details in any electronic device especially anything that may no longer be supported security wise in 5-6 years and something that may be on sold to a complete stranger in a few years. How would you ensure the data is removed?,LandRover
Other than this issue how was it treated you in terms of reliability so far?,LandRover
So keep filling it until I can find someone who WANTS to work on it?,LandRover
"Step 1: uninstall sloth from throttle body.

Step 2: reconnect intake hose to Airbox.",LandRover
It looks a little chingered there.,LandRover
Yep and you can have the frame painted whatever color you like at the dealership,LandRover
You weren’t kidding. The prices on the 3s are definitely my scene.,LandRover
"My train of thought is:

It's ticketable offense here/Canada (probably not where the photo is from). 

If the snow were to freeze into a sheet and depart the vehicle  on a highway, the driver would be liable for damages caused to any vehicle that was hit.

Usually drivers for company vehicles here need a spotless driver's abstract, so doing tests like this in public seems counterintuitive.",LandRover

damn it's a Rand Lover,LandRover
"Get a code scanner, doesn't need to be crazy good but I use an innova 5410. You want to be able to both read codes and reset modules as sometimes these cars get pissy for a stupid reason.",LandRover
"Yearly repair costs vary greatly depending on age and the model. 

My two Discovery IIs always required extra work to pass MoT. Quality control at Land Rover wasn't the best back then and it showed from time to time. I always budgeted some £1500 for extra work that would need doing like welding. Some years I didn't need to spend so much other years, well... One of my Discovery IIs blew it's ACE system and let me tell you that is a rather expensive piece of kit. 

On the other hand my Freelander 2 was very easy, it never needed something extra doing. The only expensive service it needed was the one where they change the timing belt and water pump, however I could fully plan and prepare for this.

As for my Discovery Sport it's too early to tell yet.

With an older Land Rover I'd say just put a few thousand aside in a Land Rover Rainy Day fund. If you encounter a big repair bill you can use the money to pay it and afterwards you'll top your fund back up.",LandRover
I wish could find one to build an overland rig.,LandRover
Thanks for the offer! Shipping to the western US would probably kill my savings accounts.,LandRover
Face up in the D3 face down in the D4 if it has that fuel stuff they make from pig urine.,LandRover
How much is the car worth,LandRover
Thanks !,LandRover
Thank you sir!!!,LandRover
I got a red disco sport,LandRover
It's just a tarted up Range Rover. The other models had the beautiful original dna stitched right through it,LandRover
"Just got home from a 200 mile drive and the lights kept doing it but when they would do it the cruise control would shut off and then when the lights would stop about 10 seconds after cruise control would work again, so I think something got water in it",LandRover
"Timing chain, tenisoers guides. Those are some issues with the 5.0 v8.",LandRover
"Can you clear the code and see if it comes back?...is your gas cap on tight? Is the car driving? Any signs of hesitation? Are you driving on an empty  tank? Need more details what is it a P, U etc code?",LandRover
Got a diehard. Agm 900 CCA. Works great.,LandRover
I've had the exact opposite experience. Resetting adaptions with new fluid made my gears work again.,LandRover
Fleet of shitboxes 10 times out of 10,LandRover
Hmm. I would recommend you not look at these right now then. Get a reliable Lexus RX if you’re on a budget and cant afford any risk right now. These trucks can get really expensive.,LandRover
Looks more like a mini.,LandRover
"It’s just the reality. Pay up or wait. 

It’s the most desirable vehicle around. You can always settle for second best, a Lexus LX they’re on lots.",LandRover
"Fleet every time.

Even if I won the damn euro millions I couldn't be spending 150k on one car no matter how lovely, I'd far sooner have a 40-year-old Range Rover and a huge workshop to keep it in.",LandRover
Could you share a link to the roof rack you have?,LandRover
Try back and make them an offer. I'm sure they won't mind if you are actually going to plunk down that cash offer right then and there. It will remind them of what the value really is.,LandRover
"Just to be clear Haakka studded tires definitely beat out 3PMSF on packed snow and ice. That said, we got a near-record amount of snow in Flagstaff last winter and the KO2s were adequate for both regular driving and helping people get unstuck from roadside snow drifts. The only time I couldn't bumper push a stranger out was when she left her e-brake engaged, unbeknownst to me, and my D3 dug itself into a foot of packed snow.",LandRover
Perfectly maintained. Have you changed your transmission fluid? Made sure they you have the correct amount? Checked level at 35-50° C?,LandRover
"Sounds like a great plan, disregard everything I said and go and see Fish Tony!!",LandRover
"If it said 
Hello Kitty
on it id drive it, since it doesn't,I won't",LandRover
If you don’t know anything about cars buy a Toyota and then you don’t have to worry about anything.,LandRover
1000% a warped rotor. My LR4’s rotors warp if they’re looked at cross eyed. Your caliper might be not releasing all the way which makes it worse.,LandRover
I’ve had an RX. Need more space. But I am looking at older model LX and some GX. Thanks for sharing. You’re probably right!,LandRover
"Possibly because the vehicle still performs the purpose they want it for and they don’t feel the need to prove wealth by buying a new car. The other thing is the D3/4 is an epic car that’s super comfortable, capable and still better than a new defender in some areas. Yes they are expensive to maintain, but these people probably don’t owe any money on the cars so even £2k a year in maintenance is “cheap” vs new car costs/depreciation.",LandRover
Car. Truck. SUV. Whatever,LandRover
No Insurance cover as it was driven into. You've allready experience with flooded Landrovers? They are supposed to go 850 mm into water. So I have some hope that the outside is not to bad.,LandRover
They turned the wheels for the picture lol,LandRover
Convinced they make a few thousand a year so wouldn't need that much demand. I'm sure the real numbers are higher but they do not meet demand at all.,LandRover
Can’t? I’ve never met a Land Rover or owner that understood the word Can’t!!,LandRover
What color is your interior?,LandRover
"I definitely would. I have a Defender 110x. I put a 1-in lift and A set of oversized Mickey Thompson's. It's the only way it rolls. All these defenders with 22-in street tires, forget it. But yes, it is badass and it will go at pretty much anywhere.",LandRover
"Ahh, it looks so cute when its asleep 😄",LandRover
"There should be a button on the seat, near the headrest.  Also, using the seat setting on the infotainment system works better.",LandRover
Whoa! That’s such a flex on this sub!,LandRover
Nop Switzerland but near St Moritz,LandRover
It’s well within its capabilities.,LandRover
"Where are you and how much for the XCLs?? Btw I think 9.0s are more like 36"" tires. I had 8.25x 16 XZLs and they were around 34""",LandRover
"Basically SDD is saying it has no idea what's going on. Could be an issue with your cable, could be a bug in this version of SDD or anything in between. JLR moved on from SDD a long, long time ago. My suggestion would be to consider switching to different diagnostic equipment. Something like an IID BT from GAP Diagnostics works perfect for a L320 and works at near dealer level of diagnostics. Another upside of using the IID BT is that it comes with free updates for life for the home version. SDD is no longer maintained and most of these versions people use at home can't be updated because it might invalidate the license.",LandRover
"Agreed, I absolutely love my '95, I wouldn't mind a Disco 2 either but anything after that just doesn't interest me the same way.",LandRover
"The yellow cloud afterwards is the tell tale sign of tannerite, which is a fairly serious substance and shouldn't be taken likely, but is also the C4 we have at home.",LandRover
Yes. Doesnt fix,LandRover
Okay thanks looking at investing in a proper code reader for euro cars like rovers etc. Only so much an elcheapo reader from hardware store can read and when it's AN LR I can only say bare bones stuff if that,LandRover
What is an english teacher doing on reddit😂,LandRover
"Looks like a port for an intake air resonator. Either Find a tube to replace it, or block off the port.

If that is what it is, it is only there to change the sound the intake makes.

[Edit] Google LR025081 it should look something like that.",LandRover
"Seats lay flat.  83,000 original miles (I’ll leave the conversion to you).  I anticipate maintenance, and we keep up with it.  My last Range Rover was sold (and still ran well) at 183,000.",LandRover
"Nice congratulations dude, looks awesome",LandRover
"Meant to ask. What air mattress you use? Seen a couple ads pop up for them, but I always take a real persons rec over some paid for 5 star reviews",LandRover
"Yea maybe, this happened a few months ago and I think the cause was water then but just doing a fuse cleaning fix it but idk",LandRover
Have you joined/asked the large FB tech groups such as Disco 3/4 technical?,LandRover
It's an issue for any suv with decent ground clearance. I've had mine stolen before too. It's not a problem only for Discos so don't let that deter you ,LandRover
"They aren’t terrible cars but I think people go into them with unrealistic expectations regarding the drive and level of luxury. 

These are entry level vehicles and since JLR is a smaller company they aren’t as refined at that price point as some of their competition and they don’t really make up for it with Land Rover capability.",LandRover
How expensive are we talking? I can’t weld and would like to get it repaired?,LandRover
"Ah well, no worries Fritzel. Maybe there's one in the basement?",LandRover
Unless the stupid Apple phone (sorry.. hate apple ..thieving gits!!)  doesn't have Bluetooth capabilities,LandRover
"Seems like a good deal. Im more biased towards the 4.4 / 4.2 range rovers just because they're proven to be reliable. But if I were you I'd sell the LR3 privately, 4k vs 8k is huge. Is this range rover supercharged?",LandRover
"Honestly, I had to shorten that hose by an inch because I had a pinhole and it was fine. I have been running it like that for about 1000miles with no problems.",LandRover
With a wrist like that I don’t even know how he broke the window.,LandRover
Buy a haynes manual. And find a copy of RAVE.,LandRover
Where are you finding them going under sticker.  I will buy one and then flip it to someone I know who is about to pay full price on a direct order.,LandRover
Nah keep doing what you're doing don't worry about what others say,LandRover
You can build one on their website and find out. 😉,LandRover
"Never liked the 4 seater for practicality reasons, nice color combo though.",LandRover
Brilliant,LandRover
Find a local Euro garage that can do a rebuild. Even if you have to tow to one a few hours away it would still save you buckets.,LandRover
Damn that’s a looker,LandRover
"It's the [Yangwang U8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangwang_U8) and it looks like a fever dream mash-up of various off-roaders. Still, it's not the first time a Chinese carmakers copies something from Land Rover. The [Landwind X7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landwind_X7) was a carbon copy of the Evoque. There was even a small industry of people selling Range Rover badges which you could fit to your Landwind to complete the transformation. It wasn't until after JLR made a deal to build Jaguars and Land Rovers in China that the Landwind X7 got shutdown hard by the Chinese government.",LandRover
Western US,LandRover
"That's a bit excessive. Volvo 3.2 is a strong engine. 7 or 8k miles is fine with synthetics these days. Use your best judgement, check it regularly.",LandRover
"If you were closer, I’d make an offer…. 
Excited for your project! Keep us posted/",LandRover
"I have a '20 with 60k miles. Hasn't been in the shop since I got it for anything other than maintenance, the little black hood grate which came off and the left back door weather stripping which caused the door to stick. This thing is a tank.",LandRover
31.5” unless you want to do many modifications and not be able to roll on the bump stops in case of an EAS failure.,LandRover
I have a sport. Practically the same vehicle. They share 98% of the parts and chassis.,LandRover
Sweet. What engine does it have?,LandRover
Could be a little bit of both. That's always a fun one to diag.,LandRover
"Agreed. Not to mention, the general public can barely distinguish it from a Ford Explorer. 

Don’t get me started on the Discovery Sport. Heinous vehicle.",LandRover
Lovely interior color. Don’t see that very often,LandRover
Well how much and how many miles? Etc,LandRover
"Wow thats a lot of repairs. So you did timing chains, water pumps all that? Do you see it going to 200K smoothly?",LandRover
"Were they that bad, sorry lol",LandRover
"The injector will have to be reset by a dealer, the message will still show but take the car for a drive and it disappears. If the message doesn't disappear you can start looking at replacing sensors or the injector.",LandRover
"This is the right response, all of the YOU GOT RIPPED OFF people are mouthbreathers who haven't set foot in a reputable bodyshop or have even the slightest idea of how much labor is involved in fixing this.",LandRover
"The obvious cause might be either the ultrasonic sensor in the DPF reservoir can't get a good measurement or the quality of the AdBlue is bad or there is a problem with the AdBlue injector.

The ultrasonic sensor in the AdBlue reservoir can either fail or if the reservoir has been overfilled it will return a bad reading. When topping up the AdBlue it is best not to top it up all the way because of this very problem. 

The AdBlue could have gone bad, this not uncommon as many service stations store these little tanks outside in conditions which are not suitable for storing AdBlue. If exposed to direct sunlight or too high temperatures the AdBlue will degrade and become useless. While you drive the car measures the before and after of the exhaust, if the NOx reduction was not sufficient you can get this error too. Spoiled AdBlue can cause this. Another possibility is that the AdBlue injector is clogged up. The injector lives just before the DPF, but because it sits in the exhaust it gets dirty and blocked up at times. It's a simple job to remove it and give it a good clean with a pick and some brake cleaner.",LandRover
"You will probably find a lot of that knowledge is with the older generation. They have been messing with them for eons.

There is a page on FB that goes by the same name (not affiliated) which has a lot of help/info, but the forum is where it is at. Plenty of threads to search and people are willing to help you out!

Good luck and maybe we will see you on the tracks..",LandRover
"To quote a fellow disco 1 owner; ""id say it was reliable, but you know better""",LandRover
One has off-road capability and one doesn’t. That simple.,LandRover
Ok thanks .. will get it done from outside then!!,LandRover
"Yep, have done, able to insure the defender for nearly half of what I’ve been getting back for the RR, though it’s not the silly silly money that I’ve seen posted about elsewhere.",LandRover
Claim it through your insurance. They know more about the cost than the people here.,LandRover
"I have a 2012 with 150k, and I’ve found an Indy shop I like and trust - I would spend 12-15 k there, put in a motor and drive for another 150k.  That money wouldn’t get me a cooler car out there that I’d be more happy driving so the swap makes sense to me in that matter.  I have done a lot of work on the car and know it has good suspension, trans, body and electrical components.",LandRover
Basically said the same as me. Shit lift kit and a cb plonked in a random location. That thing has 100% smashed through a farmer's gate in the middle of the night on several occasions.,LandRover
Mine was free through USAA.,LandRover
I dont understand?,LandRover
Same thing mine was in shop prior for coolant crossovers. 1st big trip since it’s been back.,LandRover
"That’s honestly not terrible, it seems manageable! I see what you’re saying though, the amount of times the car would need to be in the shop is more of the hassle. Thank you for this info! It’s exactly what I’m looking for!",LandRover
might need an inline converter 6.0 id recommended getting one at napa but u can find one used for a good 7-8k mad cheap. luckily the car is built out of durable materials that the parts are interchangeable. def something i would look into,LandRover
"In order to fix this they'd need to do quite a bit of spraying, which makes things very expensive very quickly. Your front bumper and wheelarches are colour coded, when they order a replacement it will be unpainted plastic. Those panels and the bonnet might be salvageable, but would still need a respray. If your headlight is damaged and it's a xenon one it's not going to be cheap.",LandRover
"I’ve had my 2017 since 2020, and the thing is a wonderful beast. It does not break. Other than ordinary maintenance, the car has been a blast. Knock on wood now.",LandRover
It’s a gorgeous machine. Love it or hate it - aesthetics are important to me. Thank you for sharing your personal experience. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,LandRover
3 litre the most unreliable wouldn’t get either,LandRover
How often do you drive on the freeway?,LandRover
"You won't hear timing chains and tensioners make that noise at an idle.

This sounds like a normal LR4 5.0 to me.",LandRover
That's been abused. Shit lift kit and cb radio plonked randomly in the interior are two red flags for discos.,LandRover
"If you’re set on the LR3/LR4, theres a FB group for LR3/LR4, and people constantly post vehicles for sale. Usually they are enthusiasts owned so much better taken care with every service record, and you might be able to find one already modified with some goodies at not much extra cost. Good luck!",LandRover
What did Houston do to close the deal?,LandRover
"The car in my original post is actually certified pre-owned. Just found that out. I’m feeling better about the purchase, plus all of y’all’s tips.",LandRover
The 4 is a big improvement on a 3,LandRover
"97k mi at purchase and 104k mi now. I put $15k into it, there is a long list of preventative maintenance and repairs. No regrets at all.",LandRover
"When I see the back seat of my car and it looks like the Bluey mobile I find it infuriating, but I have to keep telling myself just be like Bandit it will be alright, everything will be just fine.",LandRover
"Again, the market is telling you you’re delusional or willfully ignorant.",LandRover
The GOAT,LandRover
"Yeah if I had to choose between every car now looking like the exact same white/silver SUV or wacky modifications and paint jobs, I prefer the latter. We don't have to like everything.",LandRover
It looks kinda similar to mine which is Marmaris Teal.,LandRover
Incredible,LandRover
"Better step on it or it’s about to become a Defender 70,then a 50, then a 30…",LandRover
I didn’t think it was possible to make a new defender look worse (eating my hat),LandRover
Love the new defender. I also think discovery body style peaked with the disco II. Boxy and hard angles >.,LandRover
Find a Rover specialist shop or at least an Euro import specialist.,LandRover
Carpathian Grey,LandRover
"Nice rig. I overlanded in mine through mountains, deserts, washouts and river bottoms for two months on stock street tires. No lift. I'd run whatcha brung and learn its capabilities stock. Its very capable, you might be surprised.",LandRover
"Did ye, aye?",LandRover
"I don't even camp, and this seems like a no-brainer.",LandRover
"21k miles isn't just silly, it should be illegal. It's a very obvious scam to sell new engines as that will kill them right when they leave warranty.",LandRover
"Park in front of a coffee shop and use their free WiFi, or a friends cell phone hotspot. Drive down the High street, you will see dozens of open WiFi connections from the shops and restaurants. Some cities even have public WiFi.",LandRover
"Really, just getting it on the road again.  It's sat for about 12 years (time flies when you have kids), so lots of things to check and slowly replace as needed.",LandRover
"Ok so half the big ones. I still I’m digging through the records to see if my timing chain has been done. It’s very taught so hard to tell. I’m pretty certain the head gaskets have not. My water pump, power steering, transmission, and crossover pipes have all been done in the last four years. I’ve replaced the front air struts.",LandRover
"At least here in the USA Safelite started making their own, so it's not a total shit show here anymore.  Not sure if they also spontaneously crack if a butterfly farts.",LandRover
If I didn’t just drop 8 grand into my LR2 I’d buy it,LandRover
Old cars usually mean old money.,LandRover
Thanks I’ll check them out 👍,LandRover
"The full length ""Modular"" racks like a Front Runner, Rhino, or ProSpeedUK are the way to go these days. I have a Baja rack and that would work well for an RTT, but the track system on those other brands makes locking stuff in super easy. 

I'm a ""sleep in the back"" guy. I find RTT's super annoying to set up and take down. They're also expensive, heavy and kill your fuel economy. 

*THAT SAID* this thing is dope: [https://lucky8llc.com/products/convoy-roof-top-tent-land-rover-lr3-lr4-2005-16-onyx-utility-black-pre-assembled?\_pos=98&\_sid=e6fe733db&\_ss=r](https://lucky8llc.com/products/convoy-roof-top-tent-land-rover-lr3-lr4-2005-16-onyx-utility-black-pre-assembled?_pos=98&_sid=e6fe733db&_ss=r)",LandRover
Please please please never show it to my wife or she will want the same so badly,LandRover
How many miles on each?,LandRover
"Pre-facelift. Its a V8, but you are correct. Mid 2012 they got better tensioners, but they still jump timing.",LandRover
"I’m not sure about the cost on AC fix. Very good that they did crossovers already. 

I personally would skip the warranty but I also work on my own cars as much as possible. Part of what you’re buying is peace of mind, so it’s up to you. I’d hate to have to pay for a big fix right after the warranty expires though. Three year life on warranty, but if you pay out of pocket, there’s no timeline on that $7k.",LandRover
Personally I’d wait until it has cam/crank correlation faults.,LandRover
I can be to Atlanta in 4 hours. This car is in South Carolina. Easy to get to.,LandRover
"That’s the approach I took. I want someone who is familiar with these things to look it over when they do the oil change, not just drain, swap filter and refill. Also, someone who won’t just say “LR says it’s time to do x”. I’ve used two different indy shops (moved 1,000 miles from the first) and while the oil change is slightly cheaper, the inspection is a whole lot more confidence building",LandRover
"If you buy a 2024 Defender it will come with a 5 year/90-ish thousand miles warranty. So for the first five years of ownership you're covered. 

Keep in mind that the first five years of a new car are the easiest years by far, it's only after five years you'll run into bigger service items like say timing belts (although New Defender has a timing chain) and after seven years you'll be seeing the first wear and tear items pop up. For any leasing company this is easy money, they only have to pay for one service in the three years you'll be leasing it and afterwards they can sell the car. Anything major that breaks is most likely covered by the factory warranty, so they don't have to budget for it.",LandRover
Agree 100% keep doing what you’re doing.,LandRover
"Have you taken a look at the headlight switch? (The stalk on the steering column you push forward to turn on or off your lights.) It's always been a problem with the old Defender, take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63pXVsmK7ow) which explains the problem. Basically the switch gets cooked by how much amps the lights draw, you either need to replace the switch or fit an upgraded one.",LandRover
"My father in law has called both an 08 RX350 and a 2017 Acura RDX a ""truck"" so who the hell knows what any of those terms mean anymore.",LandRover
"Land Rover makes you purchase from your local dealer, they don't let buyers purchase from another state and pick up.  I'm in Denver and I called and asked for new salesman, I sent him my build and then went in to meet him and see if there was anything else to change.  They didn't charge me above price because I was ordering not purchasing what was in stock.  Did take a year to get vehicle in, but I ordered in 2021 when things were a little crazy.",LandRover
Also big note; it would be my first land rover ı really don't know what to pay attention to,LandRover
"Just did ignition switch, 2 air filters, one power steering line, now wheel bearings and rack and pinion, quoted 8k at dealership.",LandRover
"Go to eBay, order the parts and theme find a good used car dealer who warranty/ repair the cars they sale. Ask them to put it on/ paint it if you don’t get that color. Save the money. I have a lr4 , they told me it was 13k for transmission replacement. It was the rear end. Cost me 3500. Always get a second or third opinion tho good luck",LandRover
"The coil conversion would save you money long-term at the cost of comfort and convenience. When I went overlanding for a couple months it was pretty sweet to travel desert roads in air ride comfort. I wouldn't give that up but its one reason I went with the Land Rover. Luxury, power, performance, capability.",LandRover
There is the factory one that works pretty well if you can find it.,LandRover
"Yes, I'm in the US. I'll check em out. Thanks",LandRover
"i feel better knowing that u drive older cars, I feared i looked lower class driving a £3k car",LandRover
"Anybody that suggests AT's are ""just as good as snow tires"" is a fool. Not even close to the same performance. 

Are they ""good enough? For most people, in most climates, almost certainly. 

I had a set of Hakka's on my Audi's and I fell on my ass multiple times stepping out of the car on to black ice that the tires were completely immune to but my boots were not. Since then, we've been running the WRG series, since it doesnt seam to stay cold enough here to warrant those Hakkas.",LandRover
"There is no official way of doing so, depending on where you live it might even be illegal to do so.

Having said that, take a look at [LR Retrofits](https://lr-retrofits.co.uk/l462-discovery). They offer a ""configurable stop/start"" service which allows the car to remember the last setting for the stop/start system. If you switch it off, it will remain off until you turn it back on.",LandRover
That would be a failure of your lighting control module. Will cost between 5-$600 to replace depending on the shop most likely.,LandRover
"I will eventually get the CARPUTECH system(apple carplay), which is about 320$ USD, and I've heard lots of great things about it. But for now, I was looking for mods for my current infotenmaint system; which isn't gonna cost me anything",LandRover
I was in the same situation a couple years ago. But everything on the 2011 LR4 was basically new and it was in like new condition. So I did a new stage 2 engine and haven't looked back.,LandRover
"This one does tank turns, I saw a video of it and not gonna lie was impressed 

Not my thing however",LandRover
I did consider that but I feast to fish when I sleep in it which means I gotta put the gear somewhere too. Still a good option,LandRover
"If had proper air filtration and fuel filtration for adverse conditions (it defiantly doesn't) skip the auto I will be in the wrong gear at the wrong time every time box I'd be more on board. If they put a proper commercial diesel and not a passenger car motor in it and didn't bother testing it the nurburgring realizing skipping the need for need anti roll bars I'd be interested in actually test driving one.

Unfortunately some German engineers got involved somewhere along the line and we've ended up with a 70 series competitor, in that it's almost actually good, but it's not.",LandRover
Depends what colours,LandRover
This happened to me in December.  I found a used mirror on ebay and had a shop replace it.,LandRover
2011 Toyota Prius buy that instead.,LandRover
"Very curious… what part of my question would possibly make you judge my potential income/ affordability?  This is an $18,800 car… 

Just because I can afford something (I can afford a car 50x this amount), doesn’t mean I would do it. That’s why I’m rich",LandRover
"It works great as one 100% stock.  We would just toss some bug netting on the hoop set and roll the canvas up.  They are rare enough these days that any major modifications dramatically reduce their value, so probably the only thing it will get is a three jerry can holder (vs. the one it normally has) since mine never had the nokken winch, and I have a nice large empty space to fit them.",LandRover
"It’s pretty simple. Debating if it’s worth it, assuming you have multiple vehicles, since you are “rich”, implies you won’t drive it much. So then no, don’t buy it. 

I won’t get into a pissing match online as to who has more. Seems to me, everyone online is “rich” these days.",LandRover
"Idk anything about these cars. I’m sorry. I know that they suffer from engine issues and I had it in mind that if I found one I’d have to do an engine swap if it was that bad.

What do I look out for with the lr4? Also what other engines can go in easily. I’m seeing mostly older discovery swaps.",LandRover
Depends on how long you plan on keeping it. I wouldn’t own any LR outside of its warranty. Talking from experience here as well.,LandRover
"From my personal experience I was torn between the two and in the end I picked the lr4 because I like the peppier engine and the more updated interior. I have had this for over a year and so far I am in love with it. With that being said I have had to do a TON of maintenance that was neglected from the previous owners. Just to give you an idea I paid $11,500 for a 2012 black LR4 HSE which at the time had just over 102,000 on the odometer. Here is everything I have done to it:

Timing chain guides ✅ - 5/20/2023 - 102k

 I just bought the transmission filter conversion kit from Atlantic British with was another $319. So all I all I have spent close to $6,000 on maintenance. Do I regret it? No. Have I learned a ton of knowledge that the next time I buy one I know what to look for? Yes.

Usually what kills theses things is lack of maintenance in some form. Ignoring coolant leaks or chain slap will get you. 

I dont think its a lost cause, if you like that LR4. The L405's are great trucks, super plush. Biggest hang up for me is that the seats dont fold flush like the LR3/4 and they're harder to accessorize for offroad use.

"Congratulations!! Honestly I would say these subreddits in general have been the best resource for me. 

Mainly, cooling system issues - water pump, etc. The vehicles have plastic coolant pipes in front of and behind the engine which can fail and I think the thermostat is in a weird location so doesn't sense overheat super well (??? Someone correct me??).

So if you notice a leak from them please address them before they completely fail and fry the engine. Or you can replace in advance. I think they can start to be at risk generally 80-100k (again someone correct me). I have heard the timing chains can skip too, even with the strengthening of components vs. prior model years.

Just find an indy LR mechanic you trust and have them look it over. And yes, the car will reward you if you keep up with strict maintenance. These are too nice of a vehicle to ignore maintenance.",LandRover

100% of the time it is a low pressure fuel pump. Dont waste time clearing no point. There was a BS TSB to do a pcm update. All it did was raise the threshold for when the code throws (based off of fuel pump duty cycle) it was just a bandaid to the issue. We stopped doing the update because customers  would come back pissed in a month with the same fault and needed a fuel pump.

"Sure but you're considering the forces applied to either side of the centerline axis.  It's the inverted pendulum problem; you need a restoring force to bring the system back to equilibrium.  The weight of the trailer matters because that figures into the moment of inertia and the magnitude of the force required.  Number of axles on the trailer, and the center of mass of the system matters as well -- thus paying attention to the tongue weight with respect to payload being a big factor.  Skipping right up to a drw F350 just shortcuts those considerations.",LandRover

"Duuuude please don't stick a 20 year old TDi in that beauty, no good can come of it.

The 2.6 is not an efficient engine (but nothing from that era was) but in good fettle they are lovely things to drive and they sound great (and they're rare), failing that there's surely domestic engine swaps that would be better / more practical.

The 2.6 does not interchange with any other LR lumps so unlike (say) a 2.25 diesel you can't bolt up a 200 or 300 to that gearbox - so any engine swap is also likely a gearbox swap.

LR engines were always de-tuned for poor fuel etc so the 2.6 might have some potential, there used to be performance heads and the like a long time ago.

Don't rule out a V8 swap, a fuel injected V8 from a range rover will give a power boost and potentially an MPG boost too, not as great as a TDi but you could see 20mpg+ driven sensibly, and a much nicer drive than the tdi.

The 6cyl should already have the larger Stage 1 V8 brakes so that's a bonus.

"2021 Velar here (wife's). My hot takes, thus far. Probably a bit off-kilter from what you're looking for, but hope there's some relevance.

- JLR's connected services, as they exist do not seem on par with the industry, in general. I have friends with Kias that present far superior and more robust offerings.
- Remote Start - works most of the time, but not all of the time. The wake up function isn't user friendly - there is a wakeup timer, but it's hard to understand and quite honestly, seems poorly implemented unlike Mercedes which allows the vehicle to ""go to sleep"" and then wake up/remote start at any time, or at least it did on our MY19
- Second part to this is would like to see improved notifications on unlock, start, etc. other vehicles provide these notifications always whereas (it appears) they can only be configured for a short duration 
- Battery drain - RR is the only connected vehicle we've owned where if you don't drive the vehicle for a minimum of some time occasionally, the vehicle presents a low battery warning and needs a battery tender. And In our experience, I'm talking not driven in days (like, less than 10) not weeks. Out outgoing Mercedes (MY17 & 19) both allowed us to remote start any any time, no matter what. When I was working out of state for months at a time, I could start the car and let it run for 10 minutes without issue.
- The OTA software update feature seems to work without issue
- Wireless Car Play/Android Auto is good and appears more stable than using it wired, in our experience
- Agree with others that a way to globally manage/disable the wake up features would be nice, like everything comes one when you open the door. This became a circular problem when needing to maintain the battery during ""low battery"" warning time. Non-specific to JKR, but would be great if auto manufacturers started integrating magnetic battery tender ports standard, especially as more and more computers, TCUs, and connected systems are used.",LandRover

"So there is no objective metric for desierability however you can get an faux metric by comparing to sales with similar brands, sales numbers (compare to production capacity),  customer retention, subjective satisfaction, and buy-again polls. The only thing you can get close to is a consumer reports survey, which are known to be problematic (they never align with repair numbers as they are subjective surveys. Look at how they report Chrysler and Jeep products)

Land Rover has never scored the highest on any of those except retention, and if you ask in any car sub most people will tell you they would never but them. Don't confuse bad supply with desieranility and don't be dillusional. 

If you want a numeric value I'll do it when I get home. You are arguing against someone with a masters in data analytics and cyber security. This is a 5 minute toilet break kind of faux metric to calculate.

"My experience with the LR3 is limited to a test drive for comparison sake, but the LR4 feels noticeably newer and faster. My advice would be to worry less about mileage and find an LR4 that’s already had a chain job. These engines are reliable when maintained and the Achilles heels (timing chain tensioners and cooling system/crossover pipes) are preventatively maintained, which isn’t cheap. 

Join the LR4 Facebook groups and wait for an enthusiast to post one for sale that has good service records. I’d much rather buy one with 170k miles but 5k mile oil changes since a chain job at 100k miles as opposed to a 90k mile one that’s $5k more expensive and hasn’t had the service.",LandRover

That quote is solid to me unfortunately. Unless you have ultra low miles you’re looking at totaling if you’re doing insurance. Going to a shop with a “better” estimate may just result in delaying totaling or more headaches.

"Congrats on the new to you Discovery Sport. With the HSE Luxury trim your Discovery Sport should feature pretty much all the toys it could have. The best feature to have if is it has the 10 inch touchscreen with InControl Touch Pro instead of the smaller 8 inch screen. ICTP offers more modern features like Apple Carplay or Android Auto. 

If you want to see how the Discovery Sport looks with more black pieces of trim you can google either for ""black pack"" or ""dynamic"". Both were options that added black pieces of trim. My Discovery Sport is in the HSE Dynamic trim, so it has the gloss black grille and the plastic bits of trim that look like side vents are also in gloss black. The lettering on the bonnet and boot is also in a sort of gloss black. My Discovery Sport is in Corris Grey with the contrasting black roof, the alloys are in a dark grey. The whole package looks very smart because the darker grey fits well with the gloss black.

Land Rover offered two engines with that kind of power output, the D240 (diesel) and the P240 (petrol). Both are rare, at least in the UK and EU. The petrol engine is rare because it's very thirsty, the D240 is rare for the same reason. Most people would have opted for the D180 since it offers a good combination of more power, but retaining decent fuel economy. I wouldn't bother with re-mapping either engine. Neither will feel slow to begin with, so a re-map really doesn't offer that much. Personally I would enjoy the engine as it is.",LandRover

"> but I think the trim levels of each, the 360 degree is included as standard.

You'd be surprised how often they lack the 360 camera. Especially vehicles made in the 2020-2021 period lack a lot of tech because of the semiconductor shortages back then. Better check to make sure they have this option if you want it.

> my understanding was that anything labelled “D300” was the ingenium diesel

No. Land Rover has a habit of sticking new badges on old engines. The straight six Ingenium diesel was available in the L494 Range Rover Sport from september 2021 onwards. If this Range Rover was built before that time it's still the old Ford Lion diesel. 

> is it decent enough, when paired with mostly using Apple Car Play anyway?

Yes it is. Like I said my Discovery Sport has ICTP fitted too. I barely use it since I just plug in my phone and it does all the work through Apple Carplay. My phone does everything from satnav to streaming music. I only switch back to ICTP if I need something like the 4x4i menu. 

The ICTP satnav is fine, it's not any worse compared to other systems. Land Rover still sells updates for the maps if you want them. The updates also include a years worth of free updates, so if they publish a new map you can download it straight away. Still, I use my phone since Apple Maps is free and always updated.

My biggest complaint with ICTP would be that the interface is kinda sluggish. If you swipe through a menu or the apps there a bit of lag. First world problems I suppose. Boot up times used to be atrocious but they fixed this with updates. Now ICTP boots when you open the car, so when you press the button to start the system is ready to go.

Land Rover never says for how long they'll support an infotainment system. They just drop it at some point, but they never announce it. This is why I'm wondering what they are going to do with ICTP. Yearly updates to the software is fine, but we didn't get an update in 2023.",LandRover

"This engine is still very new, but I haven't heard anything bad about it. If you are looking at petrol engines, you could also consider the PHEV versions. The P440e or P510e is a great option too. You still get the same straight six petrol engine, but it's mated to an electric motor. It can drive a very decent amount of miles in full EV mode, even at motorway speeds. If you do a lot of city driving it will help save a lot of fuel. The only caveat being that you have to be able to charge it. Personally I wouldn't consider a petrol engine unless it's in a PHEV.",LandRover

Partly because of one in great shape popping up, but the 09 does split the difference between 3 and 4 slightly with the paint matched panels and updated rear bumper. The lux interior is nicer although less modern/more “rugged” than the lr4. I chose 3 because I wanted max dependability and It seems you can get a very nice example of a 3 for where a 4 starts in price.

"Tapa motors out of LA. I'm in Indiana so there was a shipping charge, core charge, but my shop took care of that.

And everything else was upgraded from heavy duty to extra heavy duty. I have been really eased with it. My only worry is having an accident and not getting my money out of it. But my reasoning was I could spend $20k on another vehicle that wasn't as nice as my rover, or I could spend it and get an easy 10 years out of it.",LandRover
"So I ran into the same issue.  Can you shift the gears up and down using sport mode before it goes into limp mode when you start the car?  If you had a obdi 2 scanner reader like Gap or AB you can clear the fault and reset adaption. Hopefully, it will work. 

So If you can shift up and down. Then it's  the  solenoid.  These ZF are super resilient and normally solenoids replacement and tranny fluid/filter change will solve the issue.  The solenoids are particularly sensitive to heat cause of the heat transfer from coolant degrading or a leak  or dirty oil.   

I had a tranny oil leak and let didn't  fix it. The few solenoids got over heated and went out. Plus I never changed the oil.  I found a tranny specialist and bought the solenoids pack, fluids and filter and he replaced the rest.

">I'm not sure Michelin XCL's are worth the hassle even if they are cheap.


What makes you say that?


The XZL has always seemed like a nice enough tyre, and I was given to understand that's a minor evolution of the XCL.


Really, I would like to keep it on Rangemaster's, but there's no indication when/if they will be available again... 


Particularly annoying as I have three nearly new ones, but obtaining two more that aren't in worse condition than the two I'm retiring is proving impossible.




>Lots of people fitted the longer military spring shackles to gain a bit of height for very little effort, that may be enough - I would ask on LR4x4.com forum as there's lots of Series on there and definitely a few running 9.00x16's.


I'm a bit leery of fitting extended shackles without the associated dumb iron and outrigger modifications.


I had a bad experience with extended shackles on the Hilux (where they made the rear end brutally harsh, which messed with on-road handling).


>You shouldn't need to modify any crossmembers or fit new propshafts unless you're doing really twisty off-road work.


Reading old threads on the various forums, different people seemed to have somewhat different experiences of this.


Some having no issue at all whilst others with the same lift found the rear prop rubbed on the cross member behind the transmission brake, even on the flat.


In any case I don't think I would really gain any benefit from a suspension lift, the stock axle articulation is more than enough for anything I'm likely to have the bottle to drive it over, and the longest springs in world won't give better diff clearance, which is where I'm more likely to come unstuck.


I will ask on the forums, and if the 9.00's aren't a go-er I guess I'll have to pony up for a new set of 7.50's or 235/85's",LandRover

"For the longest time I’d been dead set on a defender, I even had a new P400e on order at the end of 2022, which having ordered on a 12 month lead, then with 4 weeks notice was told it was going to arrive within 3 months or order, which didn’t suit me at the time! Fast forward a year, and having seen what’s happened to PHEV/ EV’s, and the potential of it dropping range year on year, I decided that the D300’was the one for me, but more recently, I’ve seen the values of the RR’s drop to a point where they are very very good value I think, and for the longer drives, which I’ll be doing, they offer an added layer of comfort.

I’m still leaning the way of the defender, and it’s nearly half the cost of the RR to insure currently, or at least that’s what I got quoted today.",LandRover
"Helpful. I suppose I should make a list of things for Land Rover to check. Does it not feel a little r stupid that they cannot figure out this problem? They built the car, they have the best tools. What am I missing?",LandRover
"Thanks for putting that all together, very informative.

I’ve test driven a D250 110 defender, and your right, very large imposing vehicle, didn’t take on any country lanes, nor would it be on a regular basis, but the manoeuvrability is definitely something to consider. But the size, for the longer trips is definitely a plus. I could be wrong, but I think the trim levels of each, the 360 degree is included as standard.

On the engine, my understanding was that anything labelled “D300” was the ingenium diesel, as opposed to the previous Ford, I maybe wrong, but I also read that MY21 RR sport onwards was available with the new engine, this is definitely something I would check though In any case, I’ve read and seen plenty of negative press about the Ford engines, and am definitely looking to avoid in any case. 

With ICTP vs Pivi Pro, I do mostly use Apple Car play in the cars I run now, as with all operating systems they’ll likely be supersceded within a few years, do you have any idea on how long JLR intends to support current Gen? And with ICTP do you think it now lacks due not continued support, and is there still going to be map updates? Obviously it’s not going to be as good as pivi pro, but in isolation is it decent enough, when paired with mostly using Apple Car Play anyway?

I sort of knew the short trip part, as with all larger diesels, but thought it was worth to mention, I think I’ll likely keep running my other car for the commute, just wanted to see if there was any differing opinions on it.


Thanks again for taking the time to put together all that, really appreciate it, and definitely food for thought.",LandRover

"I doubt they'll catch on. 

The Grenadier is aimed at a very niche audience of people who yearn for the old Defender whilst shouting that the new Land Rovers aren't Land Rovers at all. It doesn't have to be people who say this about Land Rover, most modern 4x4s get this kind of criticism. It's a very small crowd to begin with at any rate.

The Grenadier not only copied the look from the old Defender, it also copied the horrible ride and poor ergonomics it had. It's this weird mash-up of modern tech (Euro 6 engine, automatic transmission) with some retro stuff which is primarily the live axles and the rollerball steering. This is the thing with modern off-roaders like New Defender or any other for that matter, these vehicles show us that you can have the best of both worlds. An off-roader that is comfortable on-road and has car-like roadmanners, but is equally capable when going off-road. In the past you could only pick one and had to suffer the other, but now you get both in a single package and that is what I call evolution. Wanting to go back to those old days is somewhat being a Luddite.

There is also the matter of pricing. The Grenadier is quite expensive, with a £60K plus price tag it's up there with New Defender. It's not the vision of a working man 4x4 with that kind of prices. Neither was old Defender in the end, so perhaps the Grenadier also copied that bit.

The utility 4x4 market is dead, at least to Land Rover. The only way to be a player in that market is if you can churn out a high volume of cheap and low spec vehicles. Since the 1980s this market has been dominated by Asian carmakers. Cars like the Nissan Navara, Isuzu Dmax and Toyota Hilux reign supreme here. Land Rover can't match this and they knew it, so they moved to greener pastures. If they didn't they'd be right up there with Rover and the rest of the British car industry.",LandRover

"IID BT from GAP Diagnostics. There is no substitute, save for having access to Topix Cloud. 

A word of caution however: do not force a DPF regeneration. If you have DPF problems you need to find out why. Just forcing a regeneration if it's full can even ruin your DPF. If there is too much soot in the DPF it won't burn off, but the temperature will rise and it might damage the DPF itself. If your DPF is full it's better to have it cleaned and afterwards tell the car it has had a new DPF.

Since you had problems with your AdBlue your Discovery will also have stopped any kind of active DPF regeneration because of this. So your DPF might be full or near full. If the AdBlue problem is resolved and your DPF isn't clogged, just take your Discovery for a long drive somewhere. The car will sense the DPF is full and regenerate it. If it can't do so, get someone to clean your DPF. Do not force a regeneration.",LandRover

The dash say no cruise control then disappears.  Dash says tailgate sometimes says open and so does hood.   The radio works most the time.  The alarm likes to let me know it is working when in my garage.  Just the normal gremlins.  I tinker and they go away.  Heated stearing wheel is a no go.

"If it matters to you, the '86 will qualify for the historic vehicles tax exemption in 2 years, which will change your tax class, meaning it's also ULEZ and CAZ exempted... 

*Assuming the engine swap is the only modification and nothing else new has been done that takes it over the ""points"" limit to maintain historic vehicle eligibility.*

Depending where you live/drive regularly that's a massive financial incentive I wouldn't be able to ignore.

&#x200b;

---

In terms of the vehicle's features and construction itself, l things being equal, I'd buy the newer one, for a few reasons:

- the dash changed '89 to accommodate AC in ROW models, meaning it would be straightforward (in so much as it can be) to retrofit AC to the newer defender, but not the older one.

- You can never truly know how well an engine swap was done, if you didn't do it yourself.

- The rear side windows in the hard top are an additional failure point for leakage.

- I could get a set of standard steelies or modulars off eBay, and resell the OEM alloys for a neat little profit.

- The R380^† gearbox fitted to a post '94 defender shifts nicer than the LT77 fitted in a '86 model.

None of those is actually a very strong reason though, and even slightly better mileage, service history or condition would win out for me every single time.

&#x200b;

† the R380 sometimes gets a bad rap over spline wear where it mates with the transfer case, but in actuality that has more to do with the LT230 transfer case than the gearbox, and both the '96 and '86 models use that.",LandRover

It's a big, grunty V8 in a 1/2-ton truck that will yank around an 8000lb trailer, bull through a foot of fresh snow, or crawl up a 45-degree incline without blinking, but will not impress with its pavement princess manners.

"My 2004 freelander 1 leaks a little also. I know they get a bad reputation being a Land Rover and British engineering but it’s a bmw engine in it lol. Get into a routine of checking your oils once a week then power wash underneath once in a while. 

I’ve had my Land Rover for years and I haven’t had any serious problems with it. Sometimes it’s better to leave stuff alone. Usually more hassle than it’s worth. If it was leaking badly then you would have to fix it. 

I know a few cars that are 10 years younger than mine and they are leaking lol.",LandRover
"So I did the same thing and had the same issue. 

Spoke to my mechanic who works on these transmissions and he said the new fluid cleans the seals around solenoids and the valve seals. Which exposes cracks and starts to cause issues like this in an older transmission.

So I replaced the solenoids and valve body seals and everything works perfectly now. Total cost for the seals and solenoids was around $500CAD. If you're going to take it apart then do everything IMHO. 

The transmission fluid was the most expensive since I insisted on using the original ZF fluid and not other cheaper versions. 7 bottles (overkill) but I wanted to make sure I had enough to do the fill properly since pulling out the valve body drained almost all of the fluid in the transmission.

I also used the GAP tool to do a transmission reset and followed the instructions to a T. An example was driving up to (I think) 80kph and then taking your foot off the gas to let the vehicle slow down all the way to a near stop. Down-Shifting on its own as you go. You do this 10 times after the reset.

There are some good videos on YouTube about servicing the solenoids, and if you dig far enough you'll find the info for resetting the transmission. I think it's in the GAP FAQ's Maybe?",LandRover

"Late to the party...I had the exact same issue on an '05 LR3 HSE with 150k miles.  I ended up pulling and rebuilding the transmission (steels, frictions, bushings, rebuilt the valve body with Sonnax Zip Kit, etc.) but didn't change the solenoids.  When I measured the friction/steel stacks they weren't worn but in the end when I put it back in, it still slipped. Ended up dropping the pan again and changing the solenoids and all was right with the world.

The ZF in these beasts is rated for 450+ hp and the AJ-V8 doesn't make anywhere close to that.  FYI...ZF only makes 5 or 6 different solenoids, all based on color (green, brown, black, blue, yellow, ??). The RR/LR version was about double the BMW version with the same color of solenoids.  And these trans are in lots of vehicles including Ford Expeditions, BMWs, etc.",LandRover

"You have a diesel that's the problem. You need to do long drives weekly with a disel. Make sure your DEF is full and you may need a forced regen at a mechanic. It can also be a bad sensor.

When that counter hits 0 your car will not turn on again so deal with it immediately.

Also get a better scanner, that's insufficient for that car as you need to be able to reset modules on these cars to diagnose (I know the disc doesn't have air suspension but resetting it is one way to diagnose the suspension faults).",LandRover

"A 19 plate Velar will have InControl Touch Pro Duo fitted.

Just make sure there is no PIN on the sim as the infotainment system can't handle PIN codes. 

The latest update for ICTP is version S22B. You can check which version the car is running in the same menu that allows you to perform software updates. Since Land Rover gives 3 years of free mobile connectivity to all new cars I'd expect this Velar to already be running S22B. It would have automatically installed it as a SOTA update.",LandRover

These modules fit behind the infotainment screen, but do not replace it. Afterwards you can switch between the OEM system and your new Apple Carplay/Android Auto system. The general consensus is that these systems work rather well. 

Is it worth it? To me, the answer would be yes. Perhaps easy for me to say since my Discovery Sport supports Apple Carplay natively, but it really does help futureproof the infotainment system. A co-worker of mine recently installed an Apple Carplay module in his Range Rover Sport (L320) and is very pleased with it. Suddenly you are free from an infotainment system that hasn't been updated in forever.",LandRover

"I bought a 2013 LR4 with 170k miles last year for $8500. I had it checked out thoroughly with a mobile inspector who spent 3 hours looking over it. He was adamantly against looking at it knowing 'these things have so many issues, like the timing chains, crossover pipes, etc"". I told him he was the guy I wanted to look at it then since he knew the issues and wanted to stay away from it. He called me back after he looked at it and he was surprised at how good it looked. So I jumped in. 

However, a few months later, I started getting a small coolant leak and took it to my local Land Rover 3rd party shop. (Btw, highly recommended to have it checked with a 3rd party shop in your area before buying). He looked it over and the issue was the crossover pipes, which was going to cost me $3500 to fix (including water pump). However, he also said the timing chain was rattling and he recommended to fix that too. In the end, the total cost to get it running well again, was going to be $12k for all the work.  

I had to decide if I was going to put in that much to make it run or to cut bait. I ended up deciding to cut my losses and traded it in on a 2017 Land Rover Discovery HSE Lux with only 50k miles on it and all the maintenance done on it. Plus I splurged on a warranty that covers the engine and drive train for 20 years and unlimited miles. 

As mentioned I would recommend joining a local Rover group if you have one, and find a local 3rd party Rover mechanic and take it there for a check up. Had I done this before I jumped in I might have saved myself the headache. I miss the LR4 body style and ride but the new one is very nice.",LandRover

"Join the LR4 owner Facebook group. This topic has obviously come up a lot and there are some shops that people recommend that can install a reman engine significantly cheaper than what you were quoted. 

Since yours is a landmark with HD, I think it’s a no brainer to replace the engine, even if it’s $15-20k. You won’t find a comparable vehicle for anywhere close to $20k. And as-is with a blown motor it’s worth about $4k.",LandRover

"If this is like the Disco 2 this will be a quick disconnect on the cooler side and a 24mm on the engine side. The engine side does have an oring that usually sticks in the block when removing the oil cooler.   


For the quick disconnect, all of that oil has been collecting dirt/grime that will inhibit quick disconnection. Flood it with brake cleaner, then compressed air, then WD40 or similar so you can actually get it to unhook.

"Just found this comment on a youtube review of the pedal commander that gives me a little more faith in it. Ill give it a try. It is just a youtube comment, so ill have to take it with a grain if salt, but the explanation makes sense as to how it actually does solve input lag.

“Throttle by wire systems used to just be a 1:1 analog signal from the pedal, and the ECU's job was to keep up with the engines demands based on input from the engine sensors. Now the pedal sends digital codes to the ECU first, but it's not 1:1 from the foot pedal - everything, including the throttle position, is controlled by the ECU. The pedal is an electronic device is and is just one device of many that sends digital codes to the ECU that tell the engine how to respond. The ECU reads a digital code from the pedal and all other sensors and interprets how to make the engine and transmission work together to reduce emissions and provide a smooth drivable response (thanks to EPA and NHTSA). Throttle sensitivity boosters do more than just amplify the signal from the pedal, and it's done in a way that can not be mimicked by just increasing the speed in which you press the pedal - it talks to the ECU and then the ECU changes everything about how the truck responds - which means the fuel injector ramps, waste gates (boost), shift characteristics, etc. Very simply, it's a ""dumb"" tuner with fixed parameters, and it is not recorded as an ECU change because it's just an input to the ECU, not like a tuner that changes the ECU (which is why it can not be detected by dealers for warranty issues and it's allowed for sale in CA). Think of it this way: your gas pedal sends signals to the ECU that mimics it's position in order of depression - 1, 2, 3 ,4, 5 and so on. It can only be in that order no matter how fast you press the pedal down, and based on that input order, the ECU will not go past a certain ramp up speed no matter how fast you push down the pedal. it will be very close to 1:1 if you press it normally; but the faster you press it down, the ramp curve slows down because the ECU is waiting for the inputs from the emissions system and trans to catch up. But that process is based in part on the digital codes coming from the pedal - in very simple laymens terms, the booster sort of changes the send the order to 1, 3, 5, 7... , or 1,5, 10, 15.. and the ECU is tricked into thinking it has to play catch up, which takes priority over the other emissions and fuel economy inputs. That's way over simplified, but the point is don't think this just increases the analog amplitude of a signal from the gas pedal, because that would obviously have no effect on an ECU controller car.”",LandRover

"Personally I drive an old school disco 1, I’m not terribly familiar with the newer rovers but If I can say a few words I will. I’d a newer rover expensive to fix? Yes for multiple reasons, a lot of shops have a “no Land Rover” policy and charge huge markups in the hourly rate because of the RR badge she wears proudly. Parts tend to be expensive as well but you can find them cheaper some places, if you plan to do your own work, British Atlantic (or Atlantic British, I’m dyslexic) or rovers north are your two best places to source quality parts! My dad used to have a 2012 RRS HSE for about 4 years, he had very little issues with it and the cost to maintain it wasn’t expensive due to the lack of problems it had over the years. How often do they need to be fixed? It depends, rovers have a personality and sometimes they go many months without problems, and others the break every other week (you should definitely have a second vehicle or secondary transportation before considering a rover, buy at your own risk), but honestly aside from the occasional sensor and the poorly built air suspension, everything will always boil down to how well it’s been maintained over the years, you may end up buying a neglected rover and end up catching up on all the missed maintenance, or you could end up buying one that’s been properly maintained and be trouble free for many miles to come! Like I said, I drive an old disco one, whenever it hard breaks, it’s usually because I’m hard on the car (8/10 times I end up over abusing it off road), it’s truly been a reliable car for me and it’s definitely a fun rig to drive, and to work on, but that’s my experience, I know many other people that don’t have the experiences I’ve had. If you want my advice, I say get the car of your dreams, but plan accordingly, budget for repairs, maybe buy a tool kit (keep it with you in the car…), keep spare oil, coolant, and trans fluid in the car at all times (it’s British, if it’s leaking oil, then it’s still got oil), make sure you know how to change a tire, I’m talking from experience on this one because with the advanced air ride the rover has, it can be a pain to mess with the settings, it’s 100% worth it to go over the procedures atleast once before you have to do it in the rain at 2am in BFE. Like others have said, the 5.0 does have a timing chain issue, if you catch it before it fails it shouldn’t be terribly expensive, if it does end up failing on you, I’m sorry for your loss. It’s a rover, the sunroof might leak, just keep an eye on it and catch it before it gets really bad. If the rover is going to break, 7/10 times it’s electrical rather than mechanical, so you’ll be replacing faulty sensors and fuses more often than pumps, bearings, pulleys, belts etc. with the exception of the suspension (more specifically the air ride suspension which can always be swapped out for coil over suspension for a few grand or if you do the work yourself, you’ll save a lot!). Rovers are quirky little British cars, either you’ll come to love them, or you’ll hate it and never buy a rover again! I love the quirks, my dad on the other hand, didn’t like dealing with the maintenance. Without knowing too much about your intentions with the rover, all I can say is go for it! One life, live it!",LandRover

"The key difference is the air suspension in the Discovery 5. It can raise the ground clearance at the push of a button. The Discovery Sport can't. However when ground clearance is not an issue the Discovery Sport can easily keep up with a Discovery 5. Sometimes the Discovery Sport will even have the advantage being a bit smaller and less heavy. In tight spaces the massive size of the Discovery 5 is a disadvantage. 

Last year I was at an off-road event from Land Rover. I drove a Discovery Sport and other participants drove a Range Rover Sport and a Defender. I was able to drive through all the obstacles they did, save for one because the Discovery Sport would bottom out. The Range Rover Sport and Defender had more travel in their suspension, so they kept their wheels a bit longer to the ground, but the Discovery Sport didn't really seem to care if it cocked a leg or not. The Terrain Response system just does it's job and you don't notice that much if you have a wheel hanging or not.

With Terrain Response being as good as it is you could argue why you'd still need low range. The Discovery Sport and Range Rover Evoque solve this problem by having a very low first gear and the computer does the rest, emulating a very effective low range equivalent.",LandRover
"With that year in mind you are looking at a late L494, beyond 2022 it would the L461 which replaced the L494. The latest generation of Range Rover Sport is very new, so it's too early to say if there are known problems. Usually it takes five years or so before can really say such a thing. Every L461 sold since is still under warranty, so most problems should be sorted for free right now.

The L494 is well known by now, they are generally fine if you buy one that has been well cared for. Keep in mind that even in good condition these are never cheap cars to own. 

For both types of Range Rover Sport, either get the diesel or the PHEV version. I wouldn't bother with the normal petrol version. The diesels shine on longer trips, if you want to stay closer to home or do a lot of city driving the PHEV is good choice.",LandRover

"First off, it's a Discovery 3 not a LR3. ;) LR3 was just for marketing in the North American market since the Discovery name had suffered too much with the Discovery II there according to the Land Rover marketing department. The rest of the world has always kept  the Discovery name.

The base model diesel could be had with coils instead of air suspension, hence the button to adjust the suspension height is missing. On this entry level version even terrain respons was an option as was the automatic, so the most bare bones ones you'll find just have the high-low switch and nothing more. You won't find many of these though, most people did opt for a higher trim level. Seeing as how prices are these days for a Discovery 3 I would buy a HSE spec one or barring that a XS or SE spec. There is no benefit of going for a low spec model, unless you dislike the air suspension so much or just really want the most bare bones sort of Discovery 3 you can get.",LandRover

"These are two very different Land Rovers. At a minimum I would test drive both to get a feel for them and see which one fits you better.

Depending on the age of the Range Rover Sport the D300 will either be a Ford Lion diesel or the new Ingenium straight six diesel. The Defender will have the new Ingenium straight six diesel. 

In terms of size the Defender is much bigger. Very handy if you need to haul a lot of things, but this size also works against you in a lot of places. Parking spots will always feel tight or too small and some garages are never going to work. The rear door swings open which can also be a pain if you don't have a lot of room behind your Defender if you need to open it fully. On narrow country roads the Defender will feel like a tanker going through the Panama canal. The Range Rover Sport is big too, but it will feel a bit more agile in comparison. On either of these the 360 degree camera is a must have. 

The Defender will be the most modern of the two seeing as the Range Rover Sport is still from the L494 generation. The Defender will have the Pivi Pro infotainment system and the Range Rover Sport will have InControl Touch Pro Duo. Both offer modern features like Apple Carplay and Android Auto, but given the choice I'd opt for Pivi Pro. It's more responsive and Land Rover is still actively developing it. My Discovery Sport has InControl Touch Pro and the last major updates was from late 2022. Land Rover still supports ICTP officially since they stopped using it in 2022, but don't expect them to add anything new to it.

Keep in mind that both these diesels won't like short trips, they really need longer trips to keep the DPF in good condition.",LandRover
I think you can do oil changes from the top. Don't even have to get under the car. Just YouTube it and do it yourself. Do it every 5k miles. Buy an oil change kit on fcp euro with lifetime replacement. Thank me later,LandRover

"Is it a diesel? Could be the EGR valve stuck open, causing it to eat its own fumes - had this issue on another engine and it presented symptoms similar to bad fuel rail pressure.

"Mileage means nothing if this Discovery has been serviced as it should. I'd rather have a high mileage car with a full service history than a low mileage one that doesn't. This Discovery will have the Ford Lion diesel, which uses a timing belt. The interval is 112,000 miles or 7 years, so this Discovery will be needing one in the near future based on mileage. It probably won't have had a new one just yet, so keep this in mind.

Also if you come from a Freelander 2 be sure to test drive the Discovery 5. Last year I was considering either a Discovery 5 or a Discovery Sport as an upgrade from my Freelander 2. I liked the big Discovery, but it was massive. It really is a very big car and in narrow or small spaces it can get very unpleasant. If you are buying one make sure it has the 360 camera fitted. You really need it.

Also, consider the Discovery Sport. It was the replacement for the Freelander 2. The Discovery Sport is bigger than a Freelander and with £36k you can buy a really nice one. A young Discovery Sport with low mileage and FSH should be very doable with that kind of budget.",LandRover

The pros of keeping your Freelander are that in general they are reliable and since you've owned this one for ten years you know what condition it is in. The cons would be that in terms of tech it's very dated these days. I traded my Freelander 2 for a Discovery Sport.

"See, I don’t think they *will* replace the Disco with the Defender, though. The Disco is still their value-priced option, and does substantial volume for the brand. Meanwhile, the Defender is more fashion-oriented than anything, and commands higher prices (and probably higher profit margins). And it attracts people who think Range Rovers are too gaudy. It makes sense to have that spread.

The Disco Sport is, of course, the direct replacement for the Freelander 2/LR2; the Range Rover Evoque is, at its core, a “sexier”, more-premium version of that. Both sit on the Premium Transverse Architecture, which somehow still has DNA from the Ford EUCD platform that the Freelander 2 (and gen. 1 XC60, and various other FoMoCars cars) used. Over on the Jaguar side, the E-PACE is related to the Disco Sport and Evoque.",LandRover
"I remember in a press junket when it came out they specifically stated the disco 5 was yet to come. But like you said- who knows what they are going to name it.

I have to disagree with the comment on snow tires.  My current summer tire is a Cooper AT3W which has the 3 peak mountain snowflake rating.  It's a good tire, up there with K02s which I also have on my truck.  I've used the coopers the last couple winters, going to Mt. Hood for skiing every other weekend or so.  I just put some Nokian hakkapeliittia LT3 studded snow tires on in January.  HUGE difference, particularly on hard packed snow and ice.  It's really not even close to similar performance.  I know the coopers aren't the KO2s you suggested but they're still both AT rubber and patterns and I think have comparable performance.  I know I could get by with driving on A/Ts, but busy weekends on the mountain can involve a lot of stop and go traffic.  Stop and go on ice going downhill in a fully loaded 7k pound vehicle isn't fun.  I've done it but I'd rather have the dedicated snow tires.",LandRover

"I’m surprised to see comments here suggesting it’s a mechanical thing. I’ve never believed it to be a mechanical issue, but clearly a computer input lag/tuning issue. It’s most apparent to me when I’m slowing down, rolling a yield sign or a stop sign, and then attempt to accelerate quickly as the car is “thinking” which gear it should be in as I decelerate. 

I don’t experience this when I’m at speed or increasing in speed on the highway because the rpms are high enough I guess. I wonder what slowing down and reaccelerating would feel like if I kept it in sport mode.

You need to ask yourself, do I love this car enough to take on its potential issues. And if the answer is yes, research what are the most likely components to fail. The people stating “rubber and plastic parts in the engine”. Could be. But those people are likely to try and keep every vehicle to a like new standard. That is guaranteed to be a money pit at that point.

"Yea as a few have said below, the answer is no unfortunately, you would be better to wait until JLRs production of parts & new Vehicles starts to get back up to speed, its the waiting time of orders & Parts, thats driving the prices up...

I live in Ireland and have been driving my Discovery 4 HSE (2014) for 4 years now, and my Insurance renewal quote this year is up £500 from last year, I have been driving for over 12 years, never had any accidents or speeding fines and have a no claims bonus for over 8 years, all worth shit when the price out of nowhere has shot up £500...

Just make sure to check it every now and then. That seepage is pretty normal for a 20 year old car. Unless while its running its actively dripping,LandRover
"Holy shit you really are stupid. I'll spell it out to you. JLR has a supply chain issue and can not produce in reasonable numbers. Why do you think they cut trim levels from every model? It's the same reason why they have parts shortages and had to remove the physical buttons on 24s. 

Markups are the solution to low sales numbers and fixed operating costs. To use random numbers, if a dealer usually sells 100 vehicles a month, and had a fixed operating cost of $500,000 a month, they need to make a 5 grand on each vehicle. If they suddenly are selling 50 a month they need to make 10 grand on each vehicle to keep their doors open. 

Now scale this to actual sales numbers and you will understand the markups. Notice how none of the dealerships are exactly rolling in money despite 30k markups? That's how bad the production line is, they are selling at a fraction of what they need to keep the doors open, meaning they are selling way below their normal numbers.

If I sell 10 Rav 4s a day, then suddenly cut production to only sell 5, so there's a 100% markup and more people waiting, that doesn't make it more desirable, it means there's a supply chain issue.

A highly desired car that isn't suffering from a supply chain issue will have a supply days in the low numbers and no to minimal markup, and no parts shortage. 

You are confusing a production issue with desireability. You have 0 idea how this industry works, or how fixed costs in genera work. If still dont get it after using numbers a 1st grader could understand, you can't be helped. You are just flat wrong and the entire industry laughs at you.",LandRover
"Sounds insane, but this is how Discos work, low voltage causes the vehicle to have a crises. Low voltage causes Disco 2s to show M & S lights flashing and 3rd gear limp home mode when reverse gear has been used. Stop and start without going into reverse = fault clears.

"I would prefer the P300e over the P200. Being a plug-in hybrid the P300e will deliver vastly better fuel economy and the electric motor provides near instant torque so it feels really quick off the mark. Short trips or driving in urban conditions can be done in full EV mode, circumstances permitting. The big caveat is that in order to reap the benefits of the P300e you need to be able to charge it. If you find yourself unable to charge it on a regular basis you'll be using the petrol engine only and that really does a number on your fuel economy.

I would only consider the P200 if you know you won't be able to charge a P300e or you need more towing weight. The P300e is only rated for 1600kg. The P200 can tow up to 2000kg. Still, if you know you won't be able to charge a P300e and you don't make a lot of short trips I'd even go for a D180 or D200 over a P200.",LandRover

On trail, it's more likely that something from another system besides the engine/trans would be the cause of a stoppage.  At minimum I'd recommend having a plan for a leak or other failure in the air suspension system.  My plan is to cut the air line at the air spring and attach a quick attach fitting that will allow me to manualy inflate the spring with my air compressor.  I'd only do this in a worst case scenero to limp off a trail.  It's likely I'd need to jack the car up to be able to get enough air in the spring.

Yes, these modules aren't the cheapest but you get what you pay for in my opinion. I'd rather spend more on a quality system with a quality installation than forever chasing down faults because I went with some cheap Chinese hardware.

Since your Discovery Sport is a 2019 you could also see if you can upgrade it from InControl (8 inch screen with physical buttons) to InControl Touch Pro (10 inch screen with no buttons). If you are UK based a company called LR Retrofits does these installs, provided your car has most of the hardware already installed. Jaguars from 2018 onwards had everything already installed, it's just a matter of swapping the screen and doing some activations. It's not cheap, but you will have the original OEM system if you do this. My Discovery Sport has the 10 inch screen and it's great.",LandRover

"There’s some truth to this. 

Land Rover seems to consider the Series I and Series II a single generation, the Series II being essentially a heavy refresh of the Series I. Most of the body panels were changed, but the frame, body structure and dimensions were the same. The Series II was retroactively badged L318 once Ford took over (Ford parlance for chassis codes is usually a brand or segment signifier as a letter, and then three numbers).

It’s the same with the 3 and 4. The 4 is clearly an evolution of the 3, and both have the same chassis code, L319. Unlike the I and II, the only exterior parts changed between the 3 and 4 were bolt-on components.

That would mean that the current L462 Disco is only the third generation of the nameplate. And, honestly, it’s quite a capable vehicle. Despite losing the separate ladder frame, it’s far more rugged than just about any other luxury midsize SUV, and is every bit a proper Land Rover. You just need to get over the styling…which I’ve not been able to do.

That said, since Land Rover has called the prior two versions Disco 3 and Disco 4, it follows that the new one is Disco 5. It’s just that they’ve stopped using the numbers at all.",LandRover
"How did it flood? Quick dunk or in and out? Insurance?

Your into a can of worms. Modules, wiring harnesses, connectors, every single part of that car that was underwater will need to be pulled out and replaced. You will be chasing electrical gremlins. Ive dealt with enough to know to pull the hard parts off and send it to the crusher.  

You need a Gap tool (may or may not read all the newer modules I don’t know) or a dealer lever JLR SDD or Pathfinder. Not cheap.  Dealer will be your best bet if they will even touch it.",LandRover
"I drive mine as long as possible!  The last one was so hard to get rid of (in the parting of a loved one sort of way).

It was tough giving it away, and honestly, my wife had to adjust to the Disco.  She didn’t like it at first, but now it’s all she drives!

"There are a lot of factors at play here that influence how fast your brakes will wear down. The most obvious one is driving style. If you drive like the Stig and have to hit the brakes hard every time, they're going to wear down pretty quick. If you have a more powerful engine like the D240 or P250 it will also cause more wear on the brakes compared to say a D150. Cars fitted with an automatic gearbox also wear their brakes harder because you need to use them more often, compared to a manual which allows you to brake using the engine. Quality of the discs also plays a part. Brake discs made by a less reputable brand can wear down faster than you'd like. That price difference had to come from somewhere, just like when you fit cheap rubber. If you have low rolling resistance tyres it means you have to brake harder to achieve the same results as when you have normal tyres fitted, again meaning your brake discs and pads are going to wear quicker.

There is no easy answer here. If your brakes are getting worse a warning light should come on, or you might get a fail or advisory during your MoT. If you need to replace them, be sure to fit OEM quality at minimum or buy from a reputable brand like Brembo.",LandRover
Out of curiosity..what dealer did this?,LandRover

"Johnson Rods says starting at 32"" some trimming may be needed for LR4 because it has a bit less room than LR3. At a guess probably the arch liners are a somewhat different design since the flares are, as well.

I would also say that neither vehicle is really suited to 32"" tires mechanically since the travel limits of the suspension system will allow a 32"" to contact the arch liners on both at max upward travel. KO2s seem like the better solution, to me. R/Ts and snow tires aren't that much more amazing than them and you can get them in load range E for 265/65R18",LandRover

"I'm inclined to think sticky caliper with u/Dedward5 but I want to point out that worn front-lower-control-arm-bushings can manifest in a similar way. 

You can test this simply enough:

Bad LCA's:   
50-60 MPH, light braking, steering wheel shakes like crazy. Goes away if you brake hard or get below 35mph. 

Warped Rotors:  
Shakes worse as rotor heats up, like coming down a mountain etc. Shimmy will change with speed, get slower as you slow down. If they're bad enough you can ""Count"" the individual raised spots on the rotor as you come to a stop.",LandRover
"Another take here. Go buy a new Land Cruiser. 

Not sure about others here, but my 2022 defender has been in the shop for more than a month since I’ve owned it.

I have a 2013 LR4 with the supposed “updated” timing chain guides and still needed a chain job at 79k miles. Frequent oil changes appears to be the key factor in determining how long you can go on original chains. JLR’s recommended OCI of 15k is 10k too late.,LandRover

"I would say it depends on what recent repairs have already been made and what is covered by the warranty. Also if you have the ability to fix anything yourself. If you can buy parts and fix things yourself I think you’d spend much less than $7k over 3 years. 

If you’re paying a mechanic for everything that may be a good deal. It also depends on what is covered though. LR4 usually has problems with coolant leaks and fuel pumps. Your suspension parts will eventually wear out and need to be replaced, same for brakes. But I wouldn’t expect those to be covered. If any of these things have already been repaired recently it makes the warranty much less attractive IMO",LandRover

But imaging driving on the highway doing 70/80 not feeling comfortable with coils,  but with air suspension, the vehicle lowers to assist with handling and ride gets firmer.   Overall,  it's up to the person buying. But I'm not going to spend 2500-3000 on a coil conversion.",LandRover
"Oh we're talking studded snow tires then yes that does make a big difference.

I dunno, you seem pretty comfortable with modding, so I'd say do the LR3 mods to it, yolo the tires, and then figure out where they still don't fit because I'd bank on it being arch liners catching on them at full lock, and that you could probably remold them out of the way with a heat gun.

"I could be because they just like those Land Rovers or they just don't see a point in trading it in. At some point they become almost worthless when you trade, so you might as well keep driving. 

The old Defender does require quite a bit of money to buy one, even when they were new. Old Defender is more of a niche vehicle really, they're great fun but I wouldn't want to live with one. At least not as my daily driver. Back in the day when would go to the dealer for a new Land Rover I always thought I'd get a Defender, but twice I ended up driving away in a Discovery II. The Discovery could do the same thing a Defender did, but it was so much nicer to live with. At the end of the day you want your car to be a pleasant place to be.

"How much do you drive and is it a Land Rover dealer offering it or what dealer? Is there a cap on the amount also (ie they will only cover up to value of car at time of purchase or only cover “X dollar amount” worth of repairs). There can be lots of little “catches” in the contract which drastically change whether or not it’s a good deal. Avoid third party warranty companies in general. Definitely do not use concord auto protect, they are a scam company.

As for your situation, the car isn’t likely worth 7k in repairs  honestly (assuming you purchased somewhere around 20k usd). That being said, if you love the car, drive a lot, and want to keep it for 3+ years, it could be worth it to get that dealer plan AT DIFFERENT RATE/TERMS.

A simple turbo repair which usually fail around 70-100k is about 6-7k usd at a Land Rover dealer. Replacing an Engine is well over 15k (and if they cap the repair amount you may be on the hook for thousands in that case regardless). I’d argue that suspension, driveline parts (axles, diff pumps/haldex etc), timing chains /water pumps commonly fail or need repairing by 120k miles and are all expensive. Most repairs at a Land Rover dealer will run at least a few thousand no matter what the issue is you’re repairing.  Key factor is which repairs and maintenance services/repairs have been done already.

If I were you, I would try and see if they would up the mileage amount +/- duration, aim for 50k-60k miles over 4 years instead (or at least try for more miles if they go longer than 3 years). Also, make sure it’s $0 deductible and they use OEM parts only AND THE CONTRACT COVERS ALL LABOR COSTS as well. Carefully check the contract for any exclusions (ie they may not cover if there’s a technical service bulletin on the issue, if the failure is due to mechanical wear, lack of following service guidelines, lubrication issue etc).

Assuming no catches and the contract is fair and from a Land Rover dealer (or perhaps a VERY well respected third party dealer ), I would def do 7k for 60k miles/4 years with $0 deductible.  you’ll likely have 7k worth of repairs by that mileage/year point.  50k/4years decent chance as well. 38500 miles at 7k seems much too steep and there’s a decent chance you go that period without 7k worth of repairs…especially true if you get repairs at third party/independent shops and opt for non oem parts (that are still high quality).  For 38500 miles I’d be hard pressed to pay anything over 4k usd honestly. 


My advice, if that’s their best offer, pass & set aside the 7k for maintenance costs and repairs as they come along (and hope the engine lasts at least 38500 miles).  Or alternatively, set aside 2k for repairs and invest the other 5k in the stock market—hopefully you’ll get a nice return in 3 years.",LandRover

"I’d personally pass on the warranty and put the money toward refreshing key parts. Around 10 years is the traditional upper bound for replacing critical rubber and plastic components under the hood that get brittle due to heat cycling —cooling system hoses, serpentine belt, thermostat and hosing, y-crossover pipe (if this one has it? Might be the V8), water pump, coolant flush, transmission filter and fluid, etc. You’ll also be close to needing to replace other expensive items that aren’t covered by a warranty (note these are items you don’t replace unless they fail, but they routinely fail around 60-100k miles)—front air struts, front lower control arms, rear upper control arms, a couple wheel bearings/hub assemblies, maybe the air compressor.

This engine is not widely known for having timing chain problems, but it still happens. Get a PPI and make sure they scan the ECU and are able to do a cold start. 

Anyway, $7k would cover the cost of most, if not all, of these items at an independent shop. If DYI, probably about 1/3-1/2 that cost. I’d rather do that and know it’s in the best condition it can be.

Change the oil and filter every 5k and you’ll be very low risk for internal engine problems.",LandRover

"Make sure it has been serviced and that it was serviced more often than JLR says it should. The official interval is 21,000 miles or 2 years, which is silly. Ideally this Discovery Sport has been serviced every 8,000 miles or ever year. 

The biggest problem to look out for is oil dilution with the Ingenium diesels. Because the DPF is fitted further from the engines, regenerations take longer increasing the chance the engine is shut off during a regen. If this happens the excess diesel leaks into the sump, degrading the oil. This in turn can lead to other problems due to poor lubrication, like timing chain and turbo failures. Weak guides on the early Ingenium diesels can also lead to stretching and failing timing chains. If this Discovery Sport is running the latest software it should warn you if the oil quality has dropped too far. When taking this car for a test drive, listen on start up if you can hear a rattle from the engine. If it rattles, it's the timing chain.

If this is the 150 HP model, keep in mind it won't be quick. Since it appears to be entry level trim, I suspect it's going to be a 150 HP engine. The 180 HP and 240 HP diesels could only be had on higher trim levels.",LandRover

"Would your warranty cover the AC repair for new compressor/condenser since it was a prior known issue? I take it the dealer disclosed this prior to sale otherwise they should have paid for it to be fixed themselves. Replacing A/C /compressors/condenser can run around 2500-3k usd with labor and if they cover it fully that makes it much more favorable for you.

Also, is the car being sold “as is” but a separate after the fact option for purchasing warranty?

have you had the engine looked at by independent mechanic and also confirmed no misfires and no repeated misfires since the 2022 repair (plus how many miles were put on the vehicle since the 2022 misfire repair involving the coils/injectors/plugs etc)? Hopefully a lot of miles and no history of misfires or further servicing regarding misfiring/engine programming between 2022-now. Also, if there was history of repeat engine work/module ecu programming or repairs for misfire listed on the full service history or carfax (prior to the 2022 , that raises concerns).

Repeated misfires in same cylinder could be signs of engine damage or compression loss which would make your risk for engine failure way higher, especially if there was history of engine programming etc which could have been done for misfires. It could just be foul spark plugs or coils etc , but could be much more serious… and if few miles were put on since 2022 repair the owner may have sensed a failure approaching and sold for some other sucker to deal with…unfortunately there’s people who even have fault codes cleared prior to sale to mask issues.

At the very least, I’d want something in writing there is no engine damage or signs of damage and it was inspected by your dealer.  try and get them to guarantee they will do any engine repairs or replace engine if there’s failure/issues within at 60 days or 1000 miles (in writing) since purchase, free of charge at no cost to you. 

If you do get a warranty from them, try and negotiate  a higher mileage or more favorable terms at least for the engine and associated parts due to history of misfire in same cylinder (ie maybe add an extra 1-2 years with 15-20k  miles covering engine/engine components only. That way your engine is covered under a slightly longer contract that continues past the rest of warranty. Even better if they make agree to longer term for powertrain, which would include much more than just engine (such as transmission, differentials, driveshafts etc)…but probably unlikely.

you’ll want to make sure warranty is as close to bumper-to bumper/comprehensive as possible and covers repair for covered part and any associated parts needed for repair of that part (even if not listed specifically). You should see if your contract is known as exclusionary warranty, where the contract ONLY lists the items which specifically are NOT covered…ie excluded.. typically this type of contract is the best and most similar to manufacture/bumper to bumper warranty. The other type is inclusionary contract which specifically lists covered parts and anything not listed therefore won’t be covered… this usually is a poor option as you’ll end up on the hook paying for portions of repairs and stuff you never even thought about (which can be very costly). For instance, if your contract covers the engine block but won’t cover gaskets, fluids, nuts/bolts, belts, chains, spark plugs, water pumps, diagnostic or programming of engine , etc…. These things are necessary but if the contract is inclusionary they may not be covered (unless specifically listed).

Lastly, find out how claims are handled and what happens if denied… crucial to find out who “backs” the warranty (does the dealer back it themselves or do they have a 3rd party insurer. this matters for when claims are denied… if they have a third party backer (insurer/administrator) and the dealer denies the repair, you can circumvent the dealer and file the claim/appeal with their insurer to try and get approval or money etc. If they don’t have a backer (ie no insurer, the dealer “backs” themself), the dealer essentially has all the power to approve or deny however they want….and if they deny your claim there’s not much you can do (legal actions are long and costly for consumers and rarely worth it which they know). You’ll also want to know if repairs can only be done at their dealership or where else (and can you chose location for repair?), how do you go about payment for repair or obtaining reimbursement for repair? Bonus if they offer any perks like free loaner or rental car reimbursement for repairs that take multiple days.",LandRover

how many miles on the chassis? I doubt the block is any good.,LandRover

"This is great. Thank you. Seems like there could be a business out there to get car-specific kits put together ahead of time. Someone like me who wants an “easy button” to just click and go.

That said, this is super exhaustive. I was thinking more along the lines of “get a 10mm, 13mm, etc. because these are the most used items to….”",LandRover
"Realistically what do you think you can do on the road other than change out for your one spare or replace some fuses? You usually need replacement parts and/or fluids to do anything that needs tools. So unless you’re planning on bringing a water pump or some control arms, keep the tools to things you might personally need day to day",LandRover

"Yep. I mean, its livable, especially if the LR3 is your primary vehicle and you get used to adapting to the lag. But now that they are getting up in age and more of us have modern electric or hybrid or turbo vehicles as our primary, the difference in response time is scary to come back to, especially if you forget try to punch it to merge in traffic or something and the truck just does not react at all.",LandRover

"Not really a fan of the split e/ICE system on the SPA Volvos, seems like an afterthought and doesn't give the performance that the specs suggest. For the XC90, whatever, it's a big-ish SUV. But for the T8 cars, it would be nice to have some serious performance out of the box given the lack of aftermarket.",LandRover
Oof,LandRover
It looks good. Get a PPI done when you get it and that will answer your own question.,LandRover
Have you tried clearing the engine and transmission adaptations?,LandRover
"The newer option OP posted is a '96 build 300Tdi, so should have an R380.

The older one is the 200Tdi, so will either have it's original LT77 from '85, or the LT77S that came with the engine.",LandRover
"Would probably help if you had a genuine copy, it looks like it’s confused as the new RLCM has a later software version than the database. (If not was genuine it would go to topix and check but as it’s a cracked version it’s using a local database)",LandRover

">The V8 is shorter than the six, and with a modern serp front end it gives acres of room in a Series engine bay.


[I respectfully suggest you're at least mildly exaggerating the available room.](https://www.lrukforums.com/attachments/s4300667-jpg.53288/)


I suppose it can't make it worse than the six-cyl but all the photos I've seen of conversions result in either:


- Chopping the footwell for room and a really cramped engine bay longitudinally, or


- Replacing the front wings with Stage 1 or Defender parts and fitting a Defender grille, creating something that looks a little weird.


Like it's very do-able, but involves some compromises.


I think if you wanted to keep the original S3 grille, using a single carb V8 would at least make the air cleaner assembly take up a lot less space (LR's four different official designs for the Stage 1 induction system are all behemoths of convoluted 2½"" ducting)",LandRover
Are those dealer quoted prices? I haven't found my 5.0 L322 to be nearly that bad at a my reputable independent mechanic.,LandRover
I was wondering about the lack of information I could find before hand!! Cheers mate lots of help !,LandRover
